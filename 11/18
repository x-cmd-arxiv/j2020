In cases where a scheduler\nschedules activities in an invalid location, it is usually easy for the user to\ninfer the missing constraint by inspecting the schedule with the invalid\nactivity to determine the missing constraint. If a scheduler fails to schedule\nactivities because constraints could not be satisfied, determining the cause\ncan be more challenging. In such cases it is important to understand which\nconstraints caused the activities to fail to be scheduled and how to alter\nconstraints to achieve the desired schedule. In this paper, we describe such a\nscheduling system for NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover, as well as\nCrosscheck, an explainable scheduling tool that explains the scheduler\nbehavior. The scheduling system and Crosscheck are the baseline for operational\nuse to schedule activities for the Mars 2020 rover.

Our new method paves the way to capture real data dynamics and should\neventually benefit applications like unmixing or classification. Dealing with\ntime-series dynamics classically requires the knowledge of a dynamical model\nand an observation model. The former may be incorrect or computationally hard\nto handle, thus motivating data-driven strategies aiming at learning dynamics\ndirectly from data. In this paper, we adapt neural network architectures to\nlearn periodic dynamics of both simulated and real multispectral time-series.\nWe emphasize the necessity of choosing the right state variable to capture\nperiodic dynamics and show that our models can reproduce the average seasonal\ndynamics of vegetation using only one year of training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 16:21:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 15:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-22"}

From its decay modes, it is reasonable for people to assign\nit to the category of exotic state, say $Z^+_{cs}$, the stranged-parter of\n$Z_{c}(3900)$. This finding indicates for the first time the exotic state with\nstrange quark in charm sector, and hence has a peculiar importance. By virtue\nof the QCD Sum Rule technique, we analyze the $Z^+_{cs}$ about its possible\nconfiguration and physical properties, and find it could be configured as a\nmixture of two types of structures, $[1_c]_{\\bar{c} u}\\otimes[1_c]_{\\bar{s} c}$\nand $[1_c]_{\\bar{c} c}\\otimes[1_c]_{\\bar{s} u}$, or $[3_c]_{\\bar{c}\nu}\\otimes[\\bar{3}_c]_{\\bar{s} c}$ and $[3_c]_{\\bar{c}\nc}\\otimes[\\bar{3}_c]_{\\bar{s} u}$, with $J^P=1^+$. Physically, it then appears\nto be the emergence of a compound of four possible currents in each\nconfiguration, which tells the single current evaluation of hadron spectroscopy\nand their decay properties are sometimes not enough. We find in both cases the\nenergy spectra may fit well with the experimental observation, i.e. $3.98$ GeV,\nwithin the uncertainties, while noted the former is not favored by vector meson\nexchange model. Various $Z^+_{cs}(3980)$ decay modes are evaluated, which are\ncritical for pinning down its configuration and left for experimental\nverification.

Depending on varying\nenvironmental and wind conditions, the mechanism driving dune formation and,\nultimately, the shape of nascent dunes may differ markedly. In cases where sand\navailability is plentiful one mechanism suggested for triggering dune growth is\nlinear stability theory. Until now, this theory has only been tested using\nfield evidence in unidirectional winds. However, in many areas of the world and\non other planets where aeolian processes act, wind regimes are often bimodal or\nmultimodal. Here, we investigate field evidence of protodune formation under\nbimodal winds by applying linear stability analysis to a developing protodune\nfield. Employing recent theoretical and experimental research, combined with\nin-situ wind, sediment transport, and topographic measurements during a month\nlong field campaign at Great Sand Dunes National Park, Colorado, USA, we use a\ndevelopment of the linear stability theory to predict the spatial\ncharacteristics (orientation and wavelength) and temporal evolution (growth\nrate and migration velocity) of a protodune field. We find that the theoretical\npredictions compare well with measured dunefield attributes as characterized by\nhigh-resolution Digital Elevation Models measured using repeat terres trial\nlaser scanning. Our findings suggest that linear stability theory is a\nquantitative predictor of protodune development on sandy surfaces with a\nbimodal wind regime.

However, IRAS17020+4544 is less massive\nand has a much more modest active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity than the\nother examples. Using recent CO(1-0) observations with the NOrthern Extended\nMillimeter Array (NOEMA), we characterised the molecular gas content of the\nhost galaxy for the first time. We found that the molecular gas is distributed\ninto an apparent central disc of 1.1x10^9 Msun, and a northern extension\nlocated up to 8 kpc from the centre with a molecular gas mass M_H2~10^8 Msun.\nThe molecular gas mass and the CO dynamics in the northern extension reveal\nthat IRAS 17020+4544 is not a standard spiral galaxy, instead it is interacting\nwith a dwarf object corresponding to the northern extension. This interaction\npossibly triggers the high accretion rate onto the super massive black hole.\nWithin the main galaxy, which hosts the AGN, a simple analytical model predicts\nthat the molecular gas may lie in a ring, with less molecular gas in the\nnuclear region. Such distribution may be the result of the AGN activity which\nremoves or photodissociates the molecular gas in the nuclear region (AGN\nfeedback). Finally, we have detected a molecular outflow of mass\nM_H2=(0.7-1.2)x10^7 Msun in projection at the location of the northern galaxy,\nwith a similar velocity to that of the massive outflow reported in previous\nmillimeter data obtained by the Large Millimeter Telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 16:41:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:55:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 19:07:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-08"}

Nevertheless, PQCs are employed in Quantum Neural Networks and\nVariational Quantum Algorithms, which may allow for near-term quantum\nadvantage. Such applications require good optimizers to train PQCs. Recent\nworks have focused on quantum-aware optimizers specifically tailored for PQCs.\nHowever, ignorance of the cost landscape could hinder progress towards such\noptimizers. In this work, we analytically prove two results for PQCs: (1) We\nfind an exponentially large symmetry in PQCs, yielding an exponentially large\ndegeneracy of the minima in the cost landscape. Alternatively, this can be cast\nas an exponential reduction in the volume of relevant hyperparameter space. (2)\nWe study the resilience of the symmetries under noise, and show that while it\nis conserved under unital noise, non-unital channels can break these symmetries\nand lift the degeneracy of minima, leading to multiple new local minima. Based\non these results, we introduce an optimization method called Symmetry-based\nMinima Hopping (SYMH), which exploits the underlying symmetries in PQCs. Our\nnumerical simulations show that SYMH improves the overall optimizer performance\nin the presence of non-unital noise at a level comparable to current hardware.\nOverall, this work derives large-scale circuit symmetries from local gate\ntransformations, and uses them to construct a noise-aware optimization method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 16:43:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 17:49:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 15:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

Our results show that our\nbest technique detects 91.5% of microprocessor core performance bugs whose\naverage IPC impact across the studied applications is greater than 1% versus a\nbug-free design with zero false positives. When evaluated on memory system\nbugs, our technique achieves 100% detection with zero false positives.\nMoreover, the detection is automatic, requiring very little performance\nengineer time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 17:18:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 15:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

Such models are usually\ncombined with non-conforming discretizations as they avoid the inherent\ndifficulties associated with the generation of meshes that explicitly resolve\nfractures-matrix interfaces. However, non-conforming discretizations demand a\nmore complicated coupling of different sub-models and may require special care\nto ensure conservative fluxes. We propose a novel approach for the simulation\nof flow and transport problems in fractured porous media based on an\nequi-dimensional representation of the fractures. The major challenge for these\ntypes of representation is the creation of meshes which resolve the several\ncomplex interfaces between the fractures and the embedding matrix. To overcome\nthis difficulty, we employ a strategy based on adaptive mesh refinement (AMR).\nThe idea at the base of the proposed AMR is to start from an initially uniform\ncoarse mesh and refine the elements which have non-empty overlaps with at least\none of the fractures. Iterating this process allows to create non-uniform\nnon-conforming meshes, which do not resolve the interfaces but can approximate\nthem with arbitrary accuracy. We demonstrate that low-order finite element (FE)\ndiscretizations on adapted meshes are globally and locally conservative and we\nsuitably adapt an algebraic flux correction technique to ensure the discrete\nmaximum principle. In particular, we show that the notorious conditions on\nM-matrices have to be adapted to the basis functions defined on non-conforming\nmeshes. Although the proposed applications come from geophysical applications,\nthe obtained results could be applied to any diffusion and transport problems,\non both conforming and non-conforming meshes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 18:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

We describe an alternative Corrupt Feedback MDP formulation\nand the REALab environment platform, which both avoid the secure feedback\nassumption. We hope the design of REALab provides a useful perspective on\ntampering problems, and that the platform may serve as a unit test for the\npresence of tampering incentives in RL agent designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 18:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

A\ncomplementary picture is found for the average formation times, with the\nmass-formation time relations following trends shown for the concentrations:\nthe nodes halos being the oldest and void halo the youngest.

This accounts\nfor the variance of this distortion, where the leading variance effect is\nquadratic in the lensing deflections.

Additionally, GNN\ndesigns are often specialized to a single task, yet few efforts have been made\nto understand how to quickly find the best GNN design for a novel task or a\nnovel dataset. Here we define and systematically study the architectural design\nspace for GNNs which consists of 315,000 different designs over 32 different\npredictive tasks. Our approach features three key innovations: (1) A general\nGNN design space; (2) a GNN task space with a similarity metric, so that for a\ngiven novel task/dataset, we can quickly identify/transfer the best performing\narchitecture; (3) an efficient and effective design space evaluation method\nwhich allows insights to be distilled from a huge number of model-task\ncombinations.

This work is the fifth in a series dedicated to the development of an\nautomated, robust, and efficient methodology to identify optically variable\nAGN, aimed at deploying it on future LSST data. We test the performance of a\nrandom forest (RF) algorithm in selecting optically variable AGN candidates,\ninvestigating how the use of different AGN labeled sets (LSs) and features sets\naffects this performance. We define a heterogeneous AGN LS and choose a set of\nvariability features and optical and near-infrared colors based on what can be\nextracted from LSST data. We find that an AGN LS that includes only Type I\nsources allows for the selection of a highly pure (91%) sample of AGN\ncandidates, obtaining a completeness with respect to spectroscopically\nconfirmed AGN of 69% (vs. 59% in our previous work). The addition of colors to\nvariability features mildly improves the performance of the RF classifier,\nwhile colors alone prove less effective than variability in selecting AGN as\nthey return contaminated samples of candidates and fail to identify most\nhost-dominated AGN. We observe that a bright (r < 21 mag) AGN LS is able to\nretrieve candidate samples not affected by the magnitude cut, which is of great\nimportance as faint AGN LSs for LSST-related studies will be hard to find and\nlikely imbalanced. We estimate a sky density of 6.2 million AGN for the LSST\nmain survey down to our current magnitude limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

The low component masses and very large separation make this binary\nthe lowest binding energy system imaged to date, indicating that the outcome of\nlow-mass star formation can result in such extreme, weakly-bound systems.

The high-amplitude variability over decadal\ntimescales at 1.5 GHz (100% to $>$2500%), but roughly steady fluxes over a few\nmonths at 3 GHz, are inconsistent with extrinsic variability due to propagation\neffects, thus favoring an intrinsic origin.

The query is fully trainable and can capture group-specific information\nwhen combined with the diversity loss. An appealing property of our method is\nthat it naturally lends itself interpretability. The attention scores between\nthe learnable query and each spatial position can be interpreted as the\nimportance of that position.

At finite crossing rate, particles escape from the clusters\nsooner, making $L_\\text{c}$ smaller and the diversity less important, even\nthough crossing can enhance demixing of particle types between the cluster and\ngas phases. If the crossing rate is increased further, the clusters become\ncontrolled by particle crossing. We also consider an experiment-based\ncontinuous distribution of tumbling rates, revealing similar physics. Using\nparameters fitted from experiments with Escherichia coli bacteria, we predict\nthat the error in estimating $L_\\text{c}$ without accounting for polydispersity\nis around $60\\%$. We discuss how to find a binary system with the same CSD as\nthe fully polydisperse mixture. An effective theory is developed and shown to\ngive accurate expressions for the CSD, the effective $\\alpha$, and the average\nfraction of mobile particles. We give reasons why our qualitative results are\nexpected to be valid for other active matter models and discuss the changes\nthat would result from polydispersity in the active speed rather than in the\ntumbling rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 19:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-19"}

A\nfirst derivation for Waleffe flow exploits Fourier modes that form a natural\northonormal basis for the problem. A ROM for such basis is obtained by a\nGalerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes equation. A large basis was reduced to\n12 modes that contribute significantly in maintaining chaotic, turbulent\ndynamics. A key difference from earlier ROMs is the inclusion of two\nroll-streak structures, with spanwise wavelengths equal to $L_z$ and $L_z/2$,\nwhere $L_z$ is the spanwise length of the computational box. The resulting\nsystem was adapted to Couette flow by rewriting the Galerkin system for the\nsame 12 modes, modified so as to satisfy no-slip conditions on the walls. The\nresulting dynamical systems lead to turbulence with finite lifetimes, in\nagreement with earlier ROMs and simulations in small domains.

It relies on forming Majorana fermions using circular\nelectronic gates in two-dimensional p-wave superconductors.

The gates serve two purposes: They modulate the chemical\npotential locally to turn a topological superconductor into a normal conductor,\nand they are used to move the Majoranas in space-time. With a perpendicular\nmagnetic field, the normal region localizes a quantum of magnetic flux. Under\nthese conditions, the boundary between the normal region and the\nsuperconducting region supports a single zero-energy Majorana bound state. The\nlocalized zero mode is sufficiently separate from other states and can be\ndragged by sequentially applying voltages to the adjacent gates to implement\nquantum computation.

It is shown that: (1) Two well\nunderstood techniques, X-ray reflection spectroscopy and thermal continuum\nfitting, can be used to measure the spins of black holes that are accreting at\nmoderate rates. There is a rich set of other electromagnetic techniques\nallowing us to extend spin measurements to lower accretion rates.

(4) The advent of gravitational\nwave astronomy has enabled the detection of spin effects in merging binary\nblack holes. Most of the pre-merger black holes are found to be slowly\nspinning, a notable exception being an object that may itself be a merger\nproduct. (5) The stark difference in spins between the black hole X-ray binary\nand the binary black hole populations shows that there is a diversity of\nformation mechanisms.

Due to an intrinsic electric field, a 4-layer MoSSe\ncan rectify out-of-plane electric current. The rectifying ratio reaches 34.1 in\na model junction Zr/4-layer MoSSe/Zr. This ratio can be further enhanced by\nincreasing the number of MoSSe layers. In addition, we show a drastic sudden\nvertical compression of 4-layer MoSSe due to in-plane biaxial tensile strain,\nindicating a second phase transition. Furthermore, an odd-even effect on\nelectron transmission at the Fermi energy for Zr/$n$-layer MoSSe/Zr junctions\nwith $n=1, \\, 2,\\, 3, \\,\\dots,\\, 10$ is observed. These findings reveal the\nrichness of physics in this asymmetric system and strongly suggest that the\nproperties of 4-layer MoSSe are highly tunable, thus providing a guide to\nfuture experiments relating materials research and nanoelectronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 21:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

In history following, the agents use their\nmemory and move towards previous consensus point until the communication is\nregained. Upon regaining communication, a new consensus point is calculated\ndepending on the current positions of the agents and they change their\ntrajectories accordingly. Simulation results, for a network of six agents, show\nthat when the agents follow the previous history, the average consensus time is\nless than that of back-tracking. However, situation may arise in history\nfollowing where a false notion of reaching consensus makes one of the agents\nstop at a point near to the actual consensus point. An obstacle avoidance\nalgorithm is integrated with the proposed algorithms to avoid collisions.\nHardware implementation for a three robots system shows the effectiveness of\nthe algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 22:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

The growth of last mile deliveries alongside\nridesharing calls for an efficient and cohesive system that transports both\npassengers and goods.

We show that the mechanism's\noutcome converges to the optimal flows between markets given the reported\nsupply and demand functions from each individual market clearing. We show the\nproposed market coupling design does not alter the structure of incentives in\neach internal market, i.e., any internal market equilibrium will remain so\n(approximately) after coupling is implemented. This is achieved via incentive\ntransfers (updated at each iteration) that remunerate each market with its\nmarginal contribution (i.e. cost savings) to all other participating markets.\nWe identify a sufficient condition on a uniform participation fee for each\nmarket operator ensuring the mechanism incurs no deficit. The proposed\ndecentralized mechanism is implemented on the three-area IEEE Reliability Test\nSystem where the simulation results showcase the efficiency of proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 00:02:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 20:08:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 15:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

When training a DNN model, the intermediate activation data must be\nsaved in the memory during forward propagation and then restored for backward\npropagation. However, state-of-the-art accelerators such as GPUs are only\nequipped with very limited memory capacities due to hardware design\nconstraints, which significantly limits the maximum batch size and hence\nperformance speedup when training large-scale DNNs.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel memory-driven high performance DNN training\nframework that leverages error-bounded lossy compression to significantly\nreduce the memory requirement for training in order to allow training larger\nnetworks. Different from the state-of-the-art solutions that adopt image-based\nlossy compressors such as JPEG to compress the activation data, our framework\npurposely designs error-bounded lossy compression with a strict\nerror-controlling mechanism. Specifically, we provide theoretical analysis on\nthe compression error propagation from the altered activation data to the\ngradients, and then empirically investigate the impact of altered gradients\nover the entire training process. Based on these analyses, we then propose an\nimproved lossy compressor and an adaptive scheme to dynamically configure the\nlossy compression error-bound and adjust the training batch size to further\nutilize the saved memory space for additional speedup. We evaluate our design\nagainst state-of-the-art solutions with four popular DNNs and the ImageNet\ndataset.

The solid-body regime of Lense-Thirring precession is one\nprominent model invoked to explain the most common type of QPOs, Type C.\nHowever, solid-body precession requires a specific structure that has not been\nexamined in light of constrained properties of accretion flows. We assume in\nthis paper, as solid-body precession requires, a disk separated into two flows\nat a transition radius $r_t$: a cold outer flow and a hot inner flow (playing\nthe role of the corona). We explore the physical structure of both flows using\nmodel-independent estimates of accretion parameters. We show that, in order to\nreproduce the observed X-ray spectra during luminous hard states, the hot flow\nmust accrete at sonic to supersonic speeds, unreachable with typical viscous\ntorques. As a result of this extreme accretion speed (or high $\\alpha$\nparameter), no region of the disk during these states lies in the `wave-like'\nregime required for solid-body precession. Furthermore, we expect the flow to\nalign with the black hole spin axis via the Bardeen-Petterson effect inside a\nradius $r_{\\rm break}>r_t$. As a consequence, the hot inner flow cannot exhibit\nsolid body precession -- as currently pictured in the literature -- during\nluminous hard states. Since Type C QPOs are prevalent in these states, we\nconclude that this mechanism is unlikely to be responsible for producing Type C\nQPOs around stellar mass black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 01:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

The real question is therefore -- how can we tailor for\ndifferent fine-grained definitions under divergent levels of expertise.

However, in applications such as medical\nimaging, this \"black-and-white\" approach is too constraining because the\ncontrast between two tissues is often ill-defined, i.e., the voxels located on\nobjects' edges contain a mixture of tissues. Consequently, assigning a single\n\"hard\" label can result in a detrimental approximation. Instead, a soft\nprediction containing non-binary values would overcome that limitation. We\nintroduce SoftSeg, a deep learning training approach that takes advantage of\nsoft ground truth labels, and is not bound to binary predictions. SoftSeg aims\nat solving a regression instead of a classification problem. This is achieved\nby using (i) no binarization after preprocessing and data augmentation, (ii) a\nnormalized ReLU final activation layer (instead of sigmoid), and (iii) a\nregression loss function (instead of the traditional Dice loss). We assess the\nimpact of these three features on three open-source MRI segmentation datasets\nfrom the spinal cord gray matter, the multiple sclerosis brain lesion, and the\nmultimodal brain tumor segmentation challenges. Across multiple\ncross-validation iterations, SoftSeg outperformed the conventional approach,\nleading to an increase in Dice score of 2.0% on the gray matter dataset\n(p=0.001), 3.3% for the MS lesions, and 6.5% for the brain tumors. SoftSeg\nproduces consistent soft predictions at tissues' interfaces and shows an\nincreased sensitivity for small objects. The richness of soft labels could\nrepresent the inter-expert variability, the partial volume effect, and\ncomplement the model uncertainty estimation. The developed training pipeline\ncan easily be incorporated into most of the existing deep learning\narchitectures. It is already implemented in the freely-available deep learning\ntoolbox ivadomed (https://ivadomed.org).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 02:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-19"}

Kinetic Alfv\\'en waves are observed to be excited during\nenergetic particle injections, and are typically present in conjunction with\nTDS observations. Despite the availability of a large number of spacecraft\nobservations, the origin of TDSs and their relation to kinetic Alfv\\'en waves\nremains poorly understood to date. Part of the difficulty arises from the vast\nscale separations between kinetic Alfv\\'en waves and TDSs.

These electrons get trapped by the parallel electric\nfield of kinetic Alfv\\'en waves, form localized beam distributions, and\nsubsequently generate TDSs through beam instabilities. A big picture emerges as\nfollows: macroscale dipolarization fronts first transfer the ion flow (kinetic)\nenergy to kinetic Alfv\\'en waves at intermediate scale, which further channel\nthe energy to TDSs at the microscale and eventually deposit the energy to the\nthermal electrons in the form of heating.

Both these bounds are tight,\nand imply an $O(\\log W)$- and $O(\\log \\log W)$-competitive ratio, respectively,\nwhen the page weights lie between $1$ and $W$.

The\ndistributional character of altmetrics has not been studied yet as altmetrics\nare among the newest indicators related to scholarly publications. Here we\nselect a data sample from the altmetrics aggregator Altmetrics.com containing\nrecords from the platforms Facebook, Twitter, News, Blogs, etc., and the\ncomposite variable Alt-score for the period 2016. The individual and the\ncomposite data series of 'mentions' on the various platforms are fit to a power\nlaw distribution, and the parameters and goodness of fit determined using least\nsquares regression. The log-log plot of the data, 'mentions' vs. number of\npapers, falls on an approximately linear line, suggesting the plausibility of a\npower law distribution. The fit is not very good in all cases due to large\nfluctuations in the tail. We show that fit to the power law can be improved by\ntruncating the data series to eliminate large fluctuations in the tail.

To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first connection between parallel repetition and lower bounds for time\ncomplexity and the first major potential implication of a parallel repetition\ntheorem with more than two players.\n  Along the way to proving this result, we define and initiate a study of block\nrigidity, a weakening of Valiant's notion of rigidity. While rigidity was\noriginally defined for matrices, or, equivalently, for (multi-output) linear\nfunctions, we extend and study both rigidity and block rigidity for general\n(multi-output) functions. Using techniques of Paul, Pippenger, Szemer\\'edi and\nTrotter, we show that a block-rigid function cannot be computed by multi-tape\nTuring machines that run in linear (or slightly super-linear) time, even in the\nnon-uniform setting, where the machine gets an arbitrary advice tape.\n  We then describe a class of multiplayer games, such that, a sufficiently\nstrong parallel repetition theorem for that class of games implies an explicit\nblock-rigid function. The games in that class have the following property that\nmay be of independent interest: for every random string for the verifier\n(which, in particular, determines the vector of queries to the players), there\nis a unique correct answer for each of the players, and the verifier accepts if\nand only if all answers are correct. We refer to such games as independent\ngames. The theorem that we need is that parallel repetition reduces the value\nof games in this class from $v$ to $v^{\\Omega(n)}$, where $n$ is the number of\nrepetitions.\n  As another application of block rigidity, we show conditional size-depth\ntradeoffs for boolean circuits, where the gates compute arbitrary functions\nover large sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 05:14:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 23:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

One major challenge\nfor realizing sensing in PMNs is how to deal with spatially-separated\nasynchronous transceivers. The asynchrony between sensing receiver and\ntransmitter will cause both timing offsets (TOs) and carrier frequency offsets\n(CFOs) and lead to degraded sensing accuracy in both ranging and velocity\nmeasurements. In this paper, we propose an uplink sensing scheme for PMNs with\nasynchronous transceivers, targeting at resolving the sensing ambiguity and\nimproving the sensing accuracy. We first adopt a cross-antenna\ncross-correlation (CACC) operation to remove the sensing ambiguity associated\nwith both TOs and CFOs. Without sensing ambiguity, both actual propagation\ndelay and actual Doppler frequency of multiple targets can be obtained using\nCACC outputs. To exploit the redundancy of the CACC outputs and reduce the\ncomplexity, we then propose a novel mirrored-MUSIC algorithm, which halves the\nnumber of unknown parameters to be estimated, for obtaining actual values of\ndelays and Doppler frequencies. Finally, we propose a high-resolution\nangles-of-arrival (AoAs) estimation algorithm, which jointly processes all\nmeasurements from spatial, temporal, and frequency domains. The proposed AoAs\nestimation algorithm can achieve significantly higher estimation accuracy than\nthat of using samples from the spatial domain only.

In the literature, this\nis known as the Robust Positive Expectation(RPE)property. An obvious way to\nextend this theory to the trading of two stocks is to trade each one of them\nusing its own independent SLS controller. Motivated by the fact that such a\nscheme does not exploit any correlation between the two stocks, we study the\ncase when the relative sign between the drifts of the two stocks is known. The\nmain contributions of this paper are three-fold: First, we put forward a novel\narchitecture in which we cross-couple two SLS controllers for the two-stock\ncase. Second, we derive a closed-form expression for the expected value of the\ngain-loss function. Third, we use this closed-form expression to prove that the\nRPE property is guaranteed with respect to a large class of stock-price\ndynamics. When more information over and above the relative sign is assumed,\nadditional benefits of the new architecture are seen. For example, when bounds\nor precise values for the means and covariances of the stock returns are\nincluded in the model, numerical simulations suggest that our new controller\ncan achieve lower trading risk than a pair of decoupled SLS controllers for the\nsame level of expected trading gain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 06:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-19"}

By comparing cubes to a family of polar rectangles, we provide a\nfirst proof that an analogous inequality holds for the symmetric decreasing\nrearrangement, $Sf$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 06:27:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 18:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

Typically, the dataset originally used for training the\nTeacher model is chosen as the \"Transfer Set\" to conduct the knowledge transfer\nto the Student. However, this original training data may not always be freely\navailable due to privacy or sensitivity concerns. In such scenarios, existing\napproaches either iteratively compose a synthetic set representative of the\noriginal training dataset, one sample at a time or learn a generative model to\ncompose such a transfer set. However, both these approaches involve complex\noptimization (GAN training or several backpropagation steps to synthesize one\nsample) and are often computationally expensive. In this paper, as a simple\nalternative, we investigate the effectiveness of \"arbitrary transfer sets\" such\nas random noise, publicly available synthetic, and natural datasets, all of\nwhich are completely unrelated to the original training dataset in terms of\ntheir visual or semantic contents. Through extensive experiments on multiple\nbenchmark datasets such as MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we discover\nand validate surprising effectiveness of using arbitrary data to conduct\nknowledge distillation when this dataset is \"target-class balanced\". We believe\nthat this important observation can potentially lead to designing baselines for\nthe data-free knowledge distillation task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 06:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-19"}

Images captured in scattering media are degraded due to light\nscattering and attenuation caused by suspended particles. This degradation\ndepends on scene depth; thus, it is difficult for traditional MVS methods to\nevaluate photometric consistency because the depth is unknown before\nthree-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. The dehazing cost volume can solve this\nchicken-and-egg problem of depth estimation and image restoration by computing\nthe scattering effect using swept planes in the cost volume. We also propose a\nmethod of estimating scattering parameters, such as airlight, and a scattering\ncoefficient, which are required for our dehazing cost volume. The output depth\nof a network with our dehazing cost volume can be regarded as a function of\nthese parameters; thus, they are geometrically optimized with a sparse 3D point\ncloud obtained at a structure-from-motion step. Experimental results on\nsynthesized hazy images indicate the effectiveness of our dehazing cost volume\nagainst the ordinary cost volume regarding scattering media.

Recent research starts to apply the\ncomputer graphic techniques to extract the information from the painting\ncontent. Most of the research concentrates on the reading of the color\ninformation from the painting images and analyzes how different color\ncompositions can affect the sales prices of paintings. This paper takes a\ndifferent approach, and tries to abstract away from the interpretation of the\ncontent information, while only focus on measuring the quantity of information\ncontained. We extend the concept of Shannon entropy in information theory to\nthe painting's scenario, and suggest using the variances of a painting's\ncomposing elements, i.e., line, color, value, shape/form and space, to measure\nthe amount of information in the painting. These measures are calculated at the\npixel level based on a picture's digital image.

This is a particularly\nchallenging task on real-world data that is sparse and occluded. We propose a\nscene segmentation network based on local Deep Implicit Functions as a novel\nlearning-based method for scene completion. Unlike previous work on scene\ncompletion, our method produces a continuous scene representation that is not\nbased on voxelization. We encode raw point clouds into a latent space locally\nand at multiple spatial resolutions. A global scene completion function is\nsubsequently assembled from the localized function patches.

Small mass\nplanets migrate in type I migration, while more massive planets migrate in type\nII migration, which is thought to depend mostly on the viscous evolution rate\nof the disc. A planet is most vulnerable to inward migration before it reaches\ntype II migration and can lose a significant fraction of its semi-major axis at\nthis stage. We investigated the influence of different disc viscosities, the\ndynamical torque and gas accretion from within the horseshoe region as\nmechanisms for slowing down planet migration. Our study confirms that planets\ngrowing in low viscosity environments migrate less, due to the earlier gap\nopening and slower type II migration rate. We find that taking the gas\naccretion from the horseshoe region into account allows an earlier gap opening\nand this results in less inward migration of growing planets. Furthermore, this\neffect increases the planetary mass compared to simulations that do not take\nthe effect of gas accretion from the horseshoe region. Moreover, combining the\neffect of the dynamical torque with the effect of gas accretion from the\nhorseshoe region, significantly slows down inward migration. Taking these\neffects into account could allow the formation of cold Jupiters (a > 1 au)\ncloser to the water ice line region compared to previous simulations that did\nnot take these effects into account. We thus conclude that gas accretion from\nwithin the horseshoe region and the dynamical torque play crucial roles in\nshaping planetary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 07:56:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 05:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

While such questions remain wide open for deep neural\nnets, recent works have attempted gaining insights by studying simpler, often\nlinear, models. Our paper contributes to this growing line of work by examining\nbinary linear classification under a generative Gaussian mixture model.\nMotivated by recent results on the implicit bias of gradient descent, we study\nboth max-margin SVM classifiers (corresponding to logistic loss) and min-norm\ninterpolating classifiers (corresponding to least-squares loss). First, we\nleverage an idea introduced in [V. Muthukumar et al., arXiv:2005.08054, (2020)]\nto relate the SVM solution to the min-norm interpolating solution.

This paper presents a novel\nlearning-with-privileged based framework for online action detection where the\nfuture frames only observable at the training stages are considered as a form\nof privileged information. Knowledge distillation is employed to transfer the\nprivileged information from the offline teacher to the online student. We note\nthat this setting is different from conventional KD because the difference\nbetween the teacher and student models mostly lies in input data rather than\nthe network architecture. We propose Privileged Knowledge Distillation (PKD)\nwhich (i) schedules a curriculum learning procedure and (ii) inserts auxiliary\nnodes to the student model, both for shrinking the information gap and\nimproving learning performance.

Since these are commonsense\nbenchmarks, a model that generalizes on commonsense reasoning should not\nexperience much performance loss across multiple commonsense benchmarks. In\nthis paper, we study the generalization issue in detail by designing and\nconducting a rigorous scientific study. Using five common benchmarks, multiple\ncontrols and statistical analysis, we find clear evidence that fine-tuned\ncommonsense language models still do not generalize well, even with moderate\nchanges to the experimental setup, and may, in fact, be susceptible to dataset\nbias.

This may contradict (sub-)mm observations and challenge the\nformation of planetesimals and planets. We investigate the conditions that are\nrequired in dust evolution models for growing and trapping pebbles in PPDs when\nthe fragmentation speed is 1ms$^{-1}$ in the entire disk. We distinguish the\nparameters controlling the effects of turbulent velocities, vertical stirring,\nradial diffusion, and gas viscous evolution, always assuming that particles\ncannot diffuse faster (radially or vertically) than the gas. To form pebbles\nand produce effective particle trapping, the parameter that controls the\nparticle turbulent velocities must be small ($\\delta_t\\lesssim10^{-4}$). In\nthese cases, the vertical settling can limit the formation of pebbles, which\nalso prevents particle trapping. Therefore the parameter that sets the vertical\nsettling of the grains must be $\\delta_z<10^{-3}$. Our results suggest that\ndifferent combinations of the particle and gas diffusion parameters can lead to\na large diversity of millimeter fluxes and dust-disk radii. When pebble\nformation occurs and trapping is efficient, gaps and rings have higher contrast\nat mm-emission than in the NIR. In the case of inefficient trapping, structures\nare also formed at the two wavelengths, producing deeper and wider gaps in the\nNIR. Our results highlight the importance of obtaining observational\nconstraints of gas and particle diffusion parameters and the properties of gaps\nat short and long wavelengths to better understand basic features of PPDs and\nthe origin of the structures that are observed in these objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 09:56:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 13:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

In\nparticular, processes with up to quadratic stochastic fluctuations are\nelectromagnetically coupled quantum point particles. The stochastic derivation\noffers a clear geometric picture for Quantum Mechanics as a locally realistic\nhidden variable theory. While that sounds paradoxical, we show that Bell's\nformula for local realism is incomplete.

Here, we propose a general method for assessing\nthe validity of this potentially drastic approximation by comparing quantum\ndynamics simulated either with or without the residual couplings.

The effects of magnetic Bond number (Bom), Weber\nnumber (We), polymer concentration and magnetic nanoparticle (Fe3O4)\nconcentration in the ferrofluids were investigated. In comparison to Newtonian\nferrofluid droplets, addition of polymers caused rebound suppression of the\ndroplets relatively at lower Bom for a fixed magnetic nanoparticle\nconcentration and We. We further observed that for a fixed polymer\nconcentration and We, increasing magnetic nanoparticle concentration also\ntriggers earlier rebound suppression with increasing Bom.

However, if contention occurs, flits with low priority would\nnot only be buffered but also could not fully utilize bypass. Although there\nexist several routing algorithms that decrease contentions by rounding busy\nrouters and links, they cannot be directly applicable to SMART since it lacks\nthe support for arbitrary-turn (i.e., the number and direction of turns are\nfree of constraints) routing. Thus, in this article, to minimize contentions\nand further utilize bypass, we propose an improved SMART NoC, called ArSMART,\nin which arbitrary-turn transmission is enabled. Specifically, ArSMART divides\nthe whole NoC into multiple clusters where the route computation is conducted\nby the cluster controller and the data forwarding is performed by the\nbufferless reconfigurable router. Since the long-range transmission in SMART\nNoC needs to bypass the intermediate arbitration, to enable this feature, we\ndirectly configure the input and output ports connection rather than apply\nhop-by-hop table-based arbitration. To further explore the higher communication\ncapabilities, effective adaptive routing algorithms that are compatible with\nArSMART are proposed. The route computation overhead, one of the main concerns\nfor adaptive routing algorithms, is hidden by our carefully designed control\nmechanism. Compared with the state-of-the-art SMART NoC, the experimental\nresults demonstrate an average reduction of 40.7% in application schedule\nlength and 29.7% in energy consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 13:18:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-19"}

An automatic routine has been developed to detect patches in\nthe all-sky camera images. In addition to events with decreasing and increasing\naverage patch size evolution over the course of the pulsating aurora, events\nwith no size trends and events with intermittently increasing and decreasing\npatch size trends were also found.

Our model learns directly from the image data how\nstyles move between locations and how certain brands affect each other's\ndesigns in a predictable way. The discovered influence relationships reveal how\nboth cities and brands exert and receive fashion influence for an array of\nvisual styles inferred from the images. Furthermore, the proposed forecasting\nmodel achieves state-of-the-art results for challenging style forecasting\ntasks. Our results indicate the advantage of grounding visual style evolution\nboth spatially and temporally, and for the first time, they quantify the\npropagation of inter-brand and inter-city influences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 20:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

For cohesive zone modelling,\ntraction-separation relations represent the adhesive interactions across\ninterfaces. However, existing theoretical models do not currently capture\ntraction-separation relations that have been extracted using direct methods,\nparticularly under mixed-mode conditions. Given the complexity of the problem,\nmodels derived from the neural network approach are attractive. Although they\ncan be trained to fit data along the loading paths taken in a particular set of\nmixed-mode fracture experiments, they may fail to obey physical laws for paths\nnot covered by the training data sets. In this paper, a thermodynamically\nconsistent neural network (TCNN) approach is established to model the\nconstitutive behavior of interfaces when faced with sparse training data sets.\nAccordingly, three conditions are examined and implemented here: (i)\nthermodynamic consistency, (ii) maximum energy dissipation path control and\n(iii) J-integral conservation. These conditions are treated as constraints and\nare implemented as such in the loss function. The feasibility of this approach\nis demonstrated by comparing the modeling results with a range of physical\nconstraints. Moreover, a Bayesian optimization algorithm is then adopted to\noptimize the weight factors associated with each of the constraints in order to\novercome convergence issues that can arise when multiple constraints are\npresent. The resultant numerical implementation of the ideas presented here\nproduced well-behaved, mixed-mode traction separation surfaces that maintained\nthe fidelity of the experimental data that was provided as input.

By adding the temporal dependency of the\nreset mechanism, the new algorithm is more robust to learning-rate adjustments\non a toy dataset but does not show much improvement on larger learning tasks\nlike CIFAR-10. Empirically speaking, the benefits of the missing term are not\nworth the additional computational overhead. In many cases, the missing term\ncan be ignored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 08:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}
