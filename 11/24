Through training on one hundred\nlanguages and terabytes of texts, cross-lingual language models have proven to\nbe effective in leveraging high-resource languages to enhance low-resource\nlanguage processing and outperform monolingual models. In this paper, we\nfurther investigate the cross-lingual and cross-domain (CLCD) setting when a\npretrained cross-lingual language model needs to adapt to new domains.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel unsupervised feature decomposition method that\ncan automatically extract domain-specific features and domain-invariant\nfeatures from the entangled pretrained cross-lingual representations, given\nunlabeled raw texts in the source language. Our proposed model leverages mutual\ninformation estimation to decompose the representations computed by a\ncross-lingual model into domain-invariant and domain-specific parts.\nExperimental results show that our proposed method achieves significant\nperformance improvements over the state-of-the-art pretrained cross-lingual\nlanguage model in the CLCD setting.

First, the human kinematic chain has\nnot been carefully considered when predicting the 3D wrists. Second, previous\nworks utilize body features for the 3D fingers, where the body feature barely\ncontains finger information. To resolve the limitations, we present Hand4Whole,\nwhich has two strong points over previous works. First, we design Pose2Pose, a\nmodule that utilizes joint features for 3D joint rotations. Using Pose2Pose,\nHand4Whole utilizes hand MCP joint features to predict 3D wrists as MCP joints\nlargely contribute to 3D wrist rotations in the human kinematic chain. Second,\nHand4Whole discards the body feature when predicting 3D finger rotations.

In order to take informed decisions in a fully\nrational manner, the onset of a critical regime, characterized by an\nexponential growth of the contagion, must be identified as quickly as possible.\nProviding rigorous quantitative tools to detect such an onset represents an\nimportant contribution from the scientific community to proactively support the\npolitical decision makers. In this paper, leveraging the quickest detection\ntheory, we propose a mathematical model of the COVID-19 pandemic evolution and\ndevelop decision tools to rapidly detect the passage from a controlled regime\nto a critical one. A new sequential test -- referred to as MAST (mean-agnostic\nsequential test) -- is presented, and demonstrated on publicly available\nCOVID-19 infection data from different countries. Then, the performance of MAST\nis investigated for the second pandemic wave, showing an effective trade-off\nbetween average decision delay $\\Delta$ and risk $R$, where $R$ is inversely\nproportional to the time required to declare the need to take unnecessary\nrestrictive measures. Ideally, the decision mechanism should react as quick as\npossible for a given level of risk. We find that all the countries share the\nsame behaviour in terms of quickest detection, specifically the risk scales\nexponentially with the delay, $R \\sim \\exp{(-\\omega \\Delta)}$, where $\\omega$\ndepends on the specific nation. For a reasonably small risk level, say, one\npossibility in ten thousand (i.e., unmotivated implementation of\ncountermeasures every 27 years, on the average), the proposed algorithm detects\nthe onset of the critical regime with delay between a few days to three weeks,\nmuch earlier than when the exponential growth becomes evident.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 16:52:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 22:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

The main goal of this study is to understand the formation,\ndistribution and observational consequences of water clouds on K2-18b and other\ntemperate sub-Neptunes. We simulated the atmospheric dynamics, water cloud\nformation and spectra of K2-18b for H2-dominated atmosphere using a 3D GCM. We\nanalysed the impact of atmospheric composition (with metallicity from 1*solar\nto 1000*solar), concentration of cloud condensation nuclei and planetary\nrotation rate. Assuming that K2-18b has a synchronous rotation, we show that\nthe atmospheric circulation in the upper atmosphere essentially corresponds to\na symmetric day-to-night circulation. This regime preferentially leads to cloud\nformation at the substellar point or at the terminator. Clouds form for\nmetallicity >100*solar with relatively large particles. For 100-300*solar\nmetallicity, the cloud fraction at the terminators is small with a limited\nimpact on transit spectra. For 1000*solar metallicity, very thick clouds form\nat the terminator. The cloud distribution appears very sensitive to the\nconcentration of CCN and to the planetary rotation rate. Fitting HST transit\ndata with our simulated spectra suggests a metallicity of ~100-300*solar. In\naddition, we found that the cloud fraction at the terminator can be highly\nvariable, leading to a potential variability in transit spectra.

Furthermore, they suffer from\ndegeneracies that make the resulting estimates unreliable, without any\nmechanism to identify this situation.\n  In this paper, we show that, under widely applicable assumptions, we can\nderive a new system of equation in terms of the surface normals whose two\nsolutions can be obtained in closed-form and can easily be disambiguated\nlocally. Our formalism further allows us to assess how reliable the estimated\nlocal normals are and, hence, to discard them if they are not. Our experiments\nshow that our reconstructions, obtained from two or more views, are\nsignificantly more accurate than those of state-of-the-art methods, while also\nbeing faster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 17:26:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 12:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

A typical method to\nproceed is to factorize and parametrize the spectral properties of foregrounds\nand their scale dependence (i.e. assuming that foreground spectra are well\ndescribed everywhere by their sky average). Since in reality foreground\nproperties vary across the Galaxy, this assumption leads to inaccuracies in the\nmodel that manifest themselves as biases in the final cosmological parameters\n(in this case the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$). This is particularly relevant\nfor surveys over large fractions of the sky, such as the Simons Observatory\n(SO), where the spectra should be modeled over a distribution of parameter\nvalues. Here we propose a method based on the existing ``moment expansion''\napproach to address this issue in a power-spectrum-based analysis that is\ndirectly applicable in ground-based multi-frequency data. Additionally, the\nmethod uses only a small set of parameters with simple physical interpretation,\nminimizing the impact of foreground uncertainties on the final $B$-mode\nconstraints.

Classical envy-freeness requires that every agent likes\nthe resources allocated to it at least as much as the resources allocated to\nany other agent. In many situations this assumption can be relaxed since agents\noften do not even know each other. We enrich the envy-freeness concept by\ntaking into account (directed) social networks of the agents. Thus, we require\nthat every agent likes its own allocation at least as much as those of all its\n(out)neighbors. This leads to a \"more local\" concept of envy-freeness.

In our research we\naim to facilitate the use of online videos, which exists in ample quantity for\nmost activities and are much easier to label than sensor data, to simulate\nlabeled wearable motion sensor data. In previous work we already demonstrate\nsome preliminary results in this direction focusing on very simple, activity\nspecific simulation models and a single sensor modality (acceleration\nnorm)\\cite{10.1145/3341162.3345590}. In this paper we show how we can train a\nregression model on generic motions for both accelerometer and gyro signals and\nthen apply it to videos of the target activities to generate synthetic IMU data\n(acceleration and gyro norms) that can be used to train and/or improve HAR\nmodels. We demonstrate that systems trained on simulated data generated by our\nregression model can come to within around 10% of the mean F1 score of a system\ntrained on real sensor data. Furthermore we show that by either including a\nsmall amount of real sensor data for model calibration or simply leveraging the\nfact that (in general) we can easily generate much more simulated data from\nvideo than we can collect in terms of real sensor data the advantage of real\nsensor data can be eventually equalized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 18:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

Purifying these resources after their imperfect generation is an\nindispensable step towards using them in quantum architectures. While this\nchallenge, both in the case of Bell pairs and more general multipartite\nentangled states, is mostly overcome in the presence of perfect local quantum\nhardware with unconstrained qubit register sizes, devising optimal purification\nstrategies for finite-size realistic noisy hardware has remained elusive.

For the latter\nanalytic results are provided. We apply our result both to charm and bottom\nquark masses. In the latter case we compute and include finite charm quark mass\neffects. Furthermore, we determine the large-$\\beta_0$ result for the\nconversion formula at four-loop order. For the bottom quark we estimate the\nuncertainty in the conversion between the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ and kinetic\nmasses to about 15 MeV which is an improvement by a factor two to three as\ncompared to the two-loop formula. The improved precision is crucial for the\nextraction of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{cb}|$ at Belle\nII.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 19:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 05:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

Quantum fluctuations may `select'\none of these ground states -- a phenomenon labeled `order by (quantum)\ndisorder' in literature. In this article, we examine the mechanism(s) by which\nsuch state selection takes place. We argue that a magnet, at low energies, maps\nto a particle moving on the CGSS. State selection corresponds to localization\nof the particle at a certain point on this space. We distinguish two mechanisms\nthat can bring about localization. In the first, quantum fluctuations generate\na potential on the CGSS. If the potential has a deep enough minimum, then the\nparticle localizes in its vicinity. We denote this as `order by potential'\n(ObP). In the second scenario, the particle localizes at a self-intersection\npoint due to bound-state formation -- a consequence of geometry and quantum\ninterference. Following recent studies by the present authors, we denote this\nscenario as `order by singularity' (ObS). We place our discussion within the\ncontext of the one-dimensional spin-$S$ Kitaev model. We map out its CGSS which\ngrows systematically with increasing system size. It resembles a network where\nthe number of nodes increases exponentially. In addition, the number of wires\nthat cross at each node also grows exponentially. This self-intersecting\nstructure leads to ObS, with the low-energy physics determined by a small\nsubset of the CGSS, consisting of `Cartesian' states. A contrasting picture\nemerges when an additional XY antiferromagnetic coupling is introduced. The\nCGSS simplifies dramatically, taking the form of a circle. Spin-wave\nfluctuations generate a potential on this space, giving rise to state selection\nby ObP under certain conditions. Apart from contrasting ObS and ObP, we discuss\nthe possibility of ObS in macroscopic magnets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 19:07:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 17:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}

The $H$-graphs are the intersection graphs of connected\nsubgraphs of a subdivision of a multigraph $H$, and the properness means that\nthe containment relationship between the representations of the vertices is\nforbidden. The class of $H$-graphs was introduced as a natural (parameterized)\ngeneralization of interval and circular-arc graphs by Bir\\'o, Hujter, and Tuza\nin 1992, and the proper $H$-graphs were introduced by Chaplick et al. in WADS\n2019 as a generalization of proper interval and circular-arc graphs. For these\ngraph classes, $H$ may be seen as a structural parameter reflecting the\ndistance of a graph to a (proper) interval graph, and as such gained attention\nas a structural parameter in the design of efficient algorithms. We show the\nfollowing results.\n  - For a tree $T$ with $t$ nodes, it can be decided in $ 2^{\\mathcal{O}(t^2\n\\log t)} \\cdot n^3 $ time, whether an $n$-vertex graph $ G $ is a proper $ T\n$-graph. For yes-instances, our algorithm outputs a proper $T$-representation.\nThis proves that the recognition problem for proper $H$-graphs, where $H$\nrequired to be a tree, is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the\nsize of $T$. Previously only NP-completeness was known.\n  - Contrasting to the first result, we prove that if $H$ is not constrained to\nbe a tree, then the recognition problem becomes much harder. Namely, we show\nthat there is a multigraph $H$ with 4 vertices and 5 edges such that it is\nNP-complete to decide whether $G$ is a proper $H$-graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 19:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

Their\ncharacterisation could thus lead to the determination of the mass spectrum of\nthe perturbers and possibly reveal the existence of dark subhalos orbiting the\nMilky Way. Our goal is to construct a fully analytical model of the formation\nand evolution of gaps embedded in streams orbiting in a realistic Milky Way\npotential.

We obtain analytical expressions for the dependencies of the growth rate\non the orbit of the stream, the properties of the subhalo (mass, scale-radius),\nand the geometry of the encounter (relative velocity, impact parameter). We\nfind that the density at the centre of the gap decreases with time as a\npower-law in the same way as the density of a stream. This results in the\ndensity-contrast between a pristine and a perturbed stream on the same orbit\nasymptotically reaching a constant value dependent only on the encounter\nparameters.

With respect to consumption, we note that\nTrump's tweets are often viewed not in isolation, but rather in the context of\na set of algorithmically-curated replies. These replies may therefore color the\nway Americans consume Trump's tweets. To this end, we find some evidence that\nTwitter accounts see replies in line with their political leanings.

With these rule changes, it becomes increasingly important for coaches to\neffectively manage their timeouts. Understanding the utility of a timeout under\nvarious game scenarios, e.g., during an opposing team's run, is of the utmost\nimportance. There are two schools of thought when the opposition is on a run:\n(1) call a timeout and allow your team to rest and regroup, or (2) save a\ntimeout and hope your team can make corrections during play. This paper\ninvestigates the credence of these tenets using the Rubin causal model\nframework to quantify the causal effect of a timeout in the presence of an\nopposing team's run. Too often overlooked, we carefully consider the stable\nunit-treatment-value assumption (SUTVA) in this context and use SUTVA to\nmotivate our definition of units. To measure the effect of a timeout, we\nintroduce a novel, interpretable outcome based on the score difference to\ndescribe broad changes in the scoring dynamics. This outcome is well-suited for\nsituations where the quantity of interest fluctuates frequently, a commonality\nin many sports analytics applications. We conclude from our analysis that while\ncomebacks frequently occur after a run, it is slightly disadvantageous to call\na timeout during a run by the opposing team and further demonstrate that the\nmagnitude of this effect varies by franchise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 19:42:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 20:53:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 21:44:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}

At higher densities, pairs can condense into a low\ntemperature superconducting phase and, at or near commensurate filling on a\nbipartite lattice, to charge density wave (CDW) order. CDW formation breaks a\ndiscrete symmetry and hence occurs via a second order (Ising) transition, and\ntherefore at a finite $T_{\\rm cdw}$ in two dimensions. Quantum Monte Carlo\ncalculations have determined $T_{\\rm cdw}$ for a variety of geometries,\nincluding square, honeycomb, and Lieb lattices. The superconducting transition,\non the other hand, in $d=2$ is in the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) universality\nclass, and is much less well characterized.

With the goal of providing a\nlow cost and a high QoS, the serverless computing paradigm offers opportunities\nthat can be harnessed to attain the goals. Specifically, our strategy in this\ndissertation is to avoid redundant computing, in cases where independent task\nrequests are similar to each other and for tasks that are pointless to process.\nWe explore two main approaches to (A) reuse part of computation needed to\nprocess the services and (B) proactively pruning tasks with a low chance of\nsuccess to improve the overall QoS of the system. For the first approach, we\npropose a mechanism to identify various types of \"mergeable\" tasks, which can\nbenefit from computational reuse if they are executed together as a group. To\nevaluate the task merging configurations extensively, we quantify the\nresource-saving magnitude and then leveraging the experimental data to create a\nresource-saving predictor. We investigate multiple tasks merging approaches\nthat suit different workload scenarios to determine when it is appropriate to\naggregate tasks and how to allocate them so that the QoS of other tasks is\nminimally affected. For the second approach, we developed the mechanisms to\nskip tasks whose chance of completing on time is not worth pursuing by drop or\ndefer them.

We dynamically adjust such thresholds based\non multiple characteristics of the arriving workload and the system's\nconditions.

The key to success is to\neffectively integrate existing knowledge or hypotheses about the underlying\nstructure of the data into the architecture of deep learning models to guide\nmachine learning. Currently, such integration is commonly done through\ncustomization of the loss functions. Here we propose an alternative approach to\nintegrate existing knowledge or hypotheses of data structure by constructing\ncustom activation functions that reflect this structure. Specifically, we study\na common case when the multivariate target function $f$ to be learned from the\ndata is partially exchangeable, \\emph{i.e.} $f(u,v,w)=f(v,u,w)$ for $u,v\\in\n\\mathbb{R}^d$.

Through\ntheoretical proof and experimental verification, we show that using an even\nactivation function in one of the fully connected layers improves neural\nnetwork performance. In our experimental 9-dimensional regression problems,\nreplacing one of the non-symmetric activation functions with the designated\n\"Seagull\" activation function $\\log(1+x^2)$ results in substantial improvement\nin network performance.

This paper explores, tracking visual objects subjected to\nadditional lingual constraints. Differently from Li et al., we impose\nadditional lingual constraints upon tracking, which enables new applications of\ntracking. Whereas in their work the goal is to improve and extend upon tracking\nitself. To perform benchmarks and experiments, we contribute two datasets:\nc-MOT16 and c-LaSOT, curated through appending additional constraints to the\nframes of the original LaSOT and MOT16 datasets.

By choosing to either retain or\npool orientation channels, the choice of equivariance versus invariance can be\ndirectly controlled. Moreover, we introduce rotational weight-tying through a\nproposed cyclic Gabor convolution, further enabling generalisation over\nrotations. We combine these innovations into Learnable Gabor Convolutional\nNetworks (LGCNs), that are parameter-efficient and offer increased model\ncomplexity. We demonstrate their rotation invariance and equivariance on MNIST,\nBSD and a dataset of simulated and real astronomical images of Galactic cirri.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 21:22:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 18:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

Expert radiologists manually delineated 945 scans\nfor COVID-19 findings. In handling the variability in both the data and\nannotations, a novel federated semi-supervised learning technique is proposed\nto fully utilize all available data (with or without annotations). Federated\nlearning avoids the need for sensitive data-sharing, which makes it favorable\nfor institutions and nations with strict regulatory policy on data privacy.\nMoreover, semi-supervision potentially reduces the annotation burden under a\ndistributed setting. The proposed framework is shown to be effective compared\nto fully supervised scenarios with conventional data sharing instead of model\nweight sharing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 21:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

One algorithmic problem in this\nchallenge is the consistency verification of concurrent executions. Consistency\nverification under a reads-from map allows to compute the reads-from (RF)\nequivalence between concurrent traces, with direct applications to areas such\nas Stateless Model Checking (SMC). The RF equivalence was recently shown to be\ncoarser than the standard Mazurkiewicz equivalence, leading to impressive\nscalability improvements for SMC under SC (sequential consistency). However,\nfor the relaxed memory models of TSO and PSO (total/partial store order), the\nalgorithmic problem of deciding the RF equivalence, as well as its impact on\nSMC, has been elusive. In this work we solve the problem of consistency\nverification for the TSO and PSO memory models given a reads-from map, denoted\nVTSO-rf and VPSO-rf, respectively. For an execution of $n$ events over $k$\nthreads and $d$ variables, we establish novel bounds that scale as $n^{k+1}$\nfor TSO and as $n^{k+1}\\cdot \\min(n^{k^2}, 2^{k\\cdot d})$ for PSO. Based on our\nsolution to these problems, we develop an SMC algorithm under TSO and PSO that\nuses the RF equivalence. The algorithm is exploration-optimal, in the sense\nthat it is guaranteed to explore each class of the RF partitioning exactly\nonce, and spends polynomial time per class when $k$ is bounded. We implement\nall our algorithms in the SMC tool Nidhugg, and perform a large number of\nexperiments over benchmarks from existing literature. Our experimental results\nshow that our algorithms for VTSO-rf and VPSO-rf provide significant\nscalability improvements over standard alternatives.

Early diagnosis of SST tendinopathies is of high importance\nand hard to achieve using ultrasound imaging. In this paper, an automatic\ntendinopathy recognition framework based on convolutional neural networks has\nbeen proposed to assist the diagnosis. This framework has two essential parts\nof tendon segmentation and classification. Tendon segmentation is done through\na novel network, NASUNet, which follows an encoder-decoder architecture\nparadigm and utilizes a multi-scale Enlarging cell. Moreover, a general\nclassification pipeline has been proposed for tendinopathy recognition, which\nsupports different base models as the feature extractor engine. Two feature\nmaps comprising positional information of the tendon region have been\nintroduced as the network input to make the classification network\nspatial-aware. To evaluate the tendinopathy recognition system, a data set\nconsisting of 100 SST ultrasound images have been acquired, in which\ntendinopathy cases are double-verified by magnetic resonance imaging. In both\nsegmentation and classification tasks, lack of training data has been\ncompensated by incorporating knowledge transferring, transfer learning, and\ndata augmentation techniques. In cross-validation experiments, the proposed\ntendinopathy recognition model achieves 91% accuracy, 86.67% sensitivity, and\n92.86% specificity, showing state-of-the-art performance against other models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 22:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

Successful transitions typically occur when workers leverage their\nexisting skills in the new occupation.

While the former\neffect allows for resistance free transport, the latter brings the transport to\na complete halt. As a model system, we consider the quantum kicked rotor, where\nstrong localization is observed in the discrete momentum coordinate. In this\nmodel, we introduce the ballistic transport in the form of a Hadamard quantum\nwalk in that momentum coordinate. The two transport mechanisms are combined by\nalternating the corresponding Floquet operators. Extending the corresponding\ncalculation for the kicked rotor, we estimate the classical diffusion\ncoefficient for thecombined dynamics. Another argument, based on the\nintroduction of an effective Heisenberg time should then allow to estimate the\nlocalization time and the localization length. While this is known to work\nreasonably well in the kicked rotor case, we find that it fails in our case.\nWhile the combined dynamics still shows localization, it takes place at much\nlarger times and shows much larger localization lengths than predicted.\nFinally, we combine the kicked rotor with other types of quantum walks, namely\ndiffusive and localizing quantum walks. In the diffusive case, the localizing\ndynamics of the kicked rotor is completely canceled and we get pure diffusion.\nIn the case of the localizing quantum walk, the combined system remains\nlocalized, but with a larger localization length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 00:35:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 10:54:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-04"}

However, CVR prediction usually suffers from three major challenges\nin practice: i) data sparsity: compared with impressions, conversion samples\nare often extremely scarce; ii) sample selection bias: conventional CVR models\nare trained with clicked impressions while making inference on the entire space\nof all impressions; iii) delayed feedback: many conversions can only be\nobserved after a relatively long and random delay since clicks happened,\nresulting in many false negative labels during training. Previous studies\nmainly focus on one or two issues while ignoring the others. In this paper, we\npropose a novel neural network framework ESDF to tackle the above three\nchallenges simultaneously.

Specifically, ESDF\nutilizes sequential behavior of user actions on the entire space with all\nimpressions to alleviate the sample selection bias problem.

Most of the\nexisting feature networks pay more attention to local features rather than the\nrelationships among them. The latter is, however, also important yet more\ndifficult to explore. To obtain sufficient representations by a feature network\nis still challenging. To this end, we propose a novel robust temporal feature\nnetwork (RTFN) for feature extraction in time series classification, containing\na temporal feature network (TFN) and an LSTM-based attention network (LSTMaN).\nTFN is a residual structure with multiple convolutional layers. It functions as\na local-feature extraction network to mine sufficient local features from data.\nLSTMaN is composed of two identical layers, where attention and long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) networks are hybridized. This network acts as a relation\nextraction network to discover the intrinsic relationships among the extracted\nfeatures at different positions in sequential data. In experiments, we embed\nRTFN into a supervised structure as a feature extractor and into an\nunsupervised structure as an encoder, respectively.

Computation latency is a\ncrucial performance metric in fog computing, especially for real-time\napplications.

In this scenario, each fog node (FN) can\noffload their computation tasks to neighboring FNs in a time slot manner.

First, we study the optimization landscape of\ndirect policy optimization for MJLS, with static state feedback controllers and\nquadratic performance costs.

We prove that all three methods converge to the optimal\nstate feedback controller for MJLS at a linear rate if initialized at a\ncontroller which is mean-square stabilizing.

We constructed a catalogue of 346 M31 clusters observed by LAMOST.

We analyze that an\nalternative method, the label propagation algorithm (LPA), avoids the\naforementioned problems thus it is a promising choice for graph semi-supervised\nlearning. Nevertheless, the intrinsic limitations of LPA on feature\nexploitation and relation modeling make propagating labels become less\neffective. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework for\ngraph semi-supervised learning termed as Cyclic Label Propagation (CycProp for\nabbreviation), which integrates GNNs into the process of label propagation in a\ncyclic and mutually reinforcing manner to exploit the advantages of both GNNs\nand LPA. In particular, our proposed CycProp updates the node embeddings\nlearned by GNN module with the augmented information by label propagation,\nwhile fine-tunes the weighted graph of label propagation with the help of node\nembedding in turn. After the model converges, reliably predicted labels and\ninformative node embeddings are obtained with the LPA and GNN modules\nrespectively.

As the atom moves away from, but along the symmetry axis of the\nannular dielectric, it encounters a point where the polarizable atom\nexperiences no torque and the energy is free of orientation dependence. At this\nheight, abruptly, the atom prefers to orient its polarizability perpendicular\nto that of the dielectric.

The variance of the IPW ATE\nestimator is often estimated by assuming the weights are known and then using\nthe so-called \"robust\" (Huber-White) sandwich estimator, which results in\nconservative standard error (SE) estimation. Here it is shown that using such\nan approach when estimating the variance of the IPW ATT estimator does not\nnecessarily result in conservative SE estimates. That is, assuming the weights\nare known, the robust sandwich estimator may be conservative or\nanti-conservative. Thus confidence intervals of the ATT using the robust SE\nestimate will not be valid in general.

C5 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for cross-camera color\nconstancy on several datasets, is fast to evaluate (~7 and ~90 ms per image on\na GPU or CPU, respectively), and requires little memory (~2 MB), and thus is a\npractical solution to the problem of calibration-free automatic white balance\nfor mobile photography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 04:37:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 19:20:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:45:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2021 18:50:01 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 03:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

In this paper,\nwe propose to solve two toll pricing problems with different levels of\ncomplexity using the concept of the macroscopic or network fundamental diagram\n(MFD or NFD), where a large-scale simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment\nmodel of Melbourne, Australia is used. Four computationally efficient SBO\nmethods are applied and compared, including the proportional-integral (PI)\ncontroller, regressing kriging (RK), DIviding RECTangles (DIRECT), and\nsimultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). The comparison\nreveals that these methods work equally well on the simple problem without\nexhibiting significant performance differences. But, for the complex problem,\nRK manifests itself to be the best-performing method thanks to its capability\nof filtering out the numerical noise arising from computer simulations (i.e.\nallowing for non-smoothness of the objective function). While the PI controller\nis a more competitive solution to the simple problem given its faster rate of\nconvergence, the poor scalability of the method in the complex problem results\nin limited applicability. Two caveats, however, deserve emphasis: (i) the\nchosen critical network density of the NFD does not necessarily represent a\nrobust network control or optimization threshold, as it might shift in the\npresence of toll pricing; and (ii) re-interpolation is required as part of RK\nin order to achieve global convergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 04:39:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

To this end, we perform the\nfirst security analysis of state-of-the-art defenses and design adaptive\nevaluations on them. Our 100% adaptive attack success rates show that current\ncountermeasures are still vulnerable.

In this\nwork, we are motivated to consider the mmWave cellular network and derive the\nCRLB for AOA-based localization and its distribution using stochastic geometry.\nWe analyze how the CRLB is affected by the node locations' spatial\ndistribution, including the target and participating base stations. To apply\nthe CRLB on a network setting with random node locations, we propose an\naccurate approximation of the CRLB using the L/4-th value of ordered distances\nwhere L is the number of participating base stations. Furthermore, we derive\nthe localizability of the mmWave network, which is the probability that a\ntarget is localizable, and examine how the network parameters influence the\nlocalization performance. These findings provide us deep insight into optimum\nnetwork design that meets specified localization requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 06:50:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 02:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-26"}

Firstly, based on surrogate\nconflict measures, indicator-guided feature extraction is conducted to\nconstruct temporal-spatial and kinematical risk features. Then we develop an\nelimination-based model reliance importance (EMRI) method to\nunsupervised-select the useful features. Secondly, we propose balanced\nSilhouette Index (bSI) to evaluate the internal quality of imbalanced\nclustering. A loss function is designed that considers the clustering\nperformance in terms of internal quality, inter-cluster variation, and model\nstability.

However, this method brings excessive resource consumption both on\noffline training and online serving. Besides, simply training a single model\nwith data from multiple scenes ignores the characteristics of their own.

We introduce (in the context of\ncosmic-ray physics) a novel strategy for the computation of the relevant\nsynchrotron signals. In particular, we identify various regimes where, in\nanalogy to prompt gamma rays, the diffuse radio signal from dark matter\nannihilation/decay can be expressed as the multiplication of a \"halo\" times a\nspectral function. These functions are computed here for the first time for a\nnumber of benchmark cases. Furthermore, we find parameter regions in which the\nemissivity can be well approximated by a universal function ~ sin(kr)/r, where\nr is the galacto-centric distance. Our theoretical setup differs from previous\nwork in that, instead of employing a method-of-images strategy, we consider a\nFourier-mode expansion of the relevant Green's functions. With this strategy,\nexact results can be obtained with very low computational cost and for generic\ndark matter models. In particular, O(10- 100) Fourier modes can be easily\nincorporated into the computations in order to probe the smallest scales of the\nproblem. We also propose a new strategy to search for dark matter using radio\nobservations of dwarf galaxies that is (1) easy to implement and (2) free of\nthe otherwise large degeneracies in the description of synchrotron signals from\ndark matter. Finally, we correct a mistake in a widely used Green's function\nformula in this context.

Due to the small\nsize and scattered spatial distribution of peripheral bronchi, this is hampered\nby severe class imbalance between foreground and background regions, which\nmakes it challenging for CNN-based methods to parse distal small airways. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate that this problem is arisen by gradient erosion and\ndilation of the neighborhood voxels. During back-propagation, if the ratio of\nthe foreground gradient to background gradient is small while the class\nimbalance is local, the foreground gradients can be eroded by their\nneighborhoods. This process cumulatively increases the noise information\nincluded in the gradient flow from top layers to the bottom ones, limiting the\nlearning of small structures in CNNs. To alleviate this problem, we use group\nsupervision and the corresponding WingsNet to provide complementary gradient\nflows to enhance the training of shallow layers. To further address the\nintra-class imbalance between large and small airways, we design a General\nUnion loss function which obviates the impact of airway size by distance-based\nweights and adaptively tunes the gradient ratio based on the learning process.\nExtensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method\ncan predict the airway structures with higher accuracy and better morphological\ncompleteness than the baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 08:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 10:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

However, labeling large-scale training data is very expensive and\ntime-consuming, while large-scale synthetic dataset shows promising value in\nlearning generalizable person re-identification models. Therefore, in this\npaper a novel and practical person re-identification task is proposed,i.e. how\nto use labeled synthetic dataset and unlabeled real-world dataset to train a\nuniversal model. In this way, human annotations are no longer required, and it\nis scalable to large and diverse real-world datasets. To address the task, we\nintroduce a framework with high generalizability, namely DomainMix.\nSpecifically, the proposed method firstly clusters the unlabeled real-world\nimages and selects the reliable clusters. During training, to address the large\ndomain gap between two domains, a domain-invariant feature learning method is\nproposed, which introduces a new loss,i.e. domain balance loss, to conduct an\nadversarial learning between domain-invariant feature learning and domain\ndiscrimination, and meanwhile learns a discriminative feature for person\nre-identification. This way, the domain gap between synthetic and real-world\ndata is much reduced, and the learned feature is generalizable thanks to the\nlarge-scale and diverse training data. Experimental results show that the\nproposed annotation-free method is more or less comparable to the counterpart\ntrained with full human annotations, which is quite promising.

We propose a weakly- and semi-supervised,\nprobabilistic needle-and-reverberation-artifact segmentation algorithm to\nseparate the desired tissue-based pixel values from the superimposed artifacts.\nOur method models the intensity decay of artifact intensities and is designed\nto minimize the human labeling error. We demonstrate the applicability of the\napproach and compare it against other segmentation algorithms. Our method is\ncapable of differentiating between the reverberations from artifact-free\npatches as well as of modeling the intensity fall-off in the artifacts. Our\nmethod matches state-of-the-art artifact segmentation performance and sets a\nnew standard in estimating the per-pixel contributions of artifact vs\nunderlying anatomy, especially in the immediately adjacent regions between\nreverberation lines. Our algorithm is also able to improve the performance\ndownstream image analysis algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 08:34:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 18:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

The key idea behind our\nefficient design is by optimizing a series of sub-objectives simultaneously via\nexplicit constraints.

First, an Efficient Atrous Spatial\nPyramid Pooling (e-ASPP) module is introduced to fuse multi-scale features for\nsemantic estimation.

In this work, we address the task\nof LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, which aims to parse both objects and\nscenes in a unified manner. As one of the first endeavors towards this new\nchallenging task, we propose the Dynamic Shifting Network (DS-Net), which\nserves as an effective panoptic segmentation framework in the point cloud\nrealm.

The extracted features are shared by the semantic\nbranch and the instance branch which operates in a bottom-up clustering style.\n2) Dynamic Shifting for complex point distributions. We observe that\ncommonly-used clustering algorithms like BFS or DBSCAN are incapable of\nhandling complex autonomous driving scenes with non-uniform point cloud\ndistributions and varying instance sizes. Thus, we present an efficient\nlearnable clustering module, dynamic shifting, which adapts kernel functions\non-the-fly for different instances. 3) Consensus-driven Fusion.

The first algorithm generalizes the\nsuccessive nonnegative projection algorithm (SNPA), designed for linear BSS,\nand is referred to as SNPALQ. By explicitly modeling the product terms inherent\nto the LQ model along the iterations of the SNPA scheme, the nonlinear\ncontributions of the mixing are mitigated, thus improving the separation\nquality. SNPALQ is shown to be able to recover the ground truth factors that\ngenerated the data, even in the presence of noise. The second algorithm is a\nbrute-force (BF) algorithm, which is used as a post-processing step for SNPALQ.\nIt enables to discard the spurious (mixed) samples extracted by SNPALQ, thus\nbroadening its applicability. The BF is in turn shown to be robust to noise\nunder easier-to-check and milder conditions than SNPALQ. We show that SNPALQ\nwith and without the BF postprocessing is relevant in realistic numerical\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 08:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-20"}

For example, for PDEs with high-order\nderivatives, the performance of existing methods is unsatisfactory, especially\nwhen the data are sparse and noisy. It is also difficult to discover\nheterogeneous parametric PDEs where heterogeneous parameters are embedded in\nthe partial differential operators. In this work, a new framework combining\ndeep-learning and integral form is proposed to handle the above-mentioned\nproblems simultaneously, and improve the accuracy and stability of PDE\ndiscovery. In the framework, a deep neural network is firstly trained with\nobservation data to generate meta-data and calculate derivatives. Then, a\nunified integral form is defined, and the genetic algorithm is employed to\ndiscover the best structure. Finally, the value of parameters is calculated,\nand whether the parameters are constants or variables is identified. Numerical\nexperiments proved that our proposed algorithm is more robust to noise and more\naccurate compared with existing methods due to the utilization of integral\nform. Our proposed algorithm is also able to discover PDEs with high-order\nderivatives or heterogeneous parameters accurately with sparse and noisy data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 09:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

While practitioners prefer Adam because it requires less\nparameter tuning, its use is problematic from a theoretical point of view since\nit may not converge. Variants of Adam have been proposed with provable\nconvergence guarantee, but they tend not be competitive with Adam on the\npractical performance. In this paper, we propose a new method named Adam$^+$\n(pronounced as Adam-plus). Adam$^+$ retains some of the key components of Adam\nbut it also has several noticeable differences: (i) it does not maintain the\nmoving average of second moment estimate but instead computes the moving\naverage of first moment estimate at extrapolated points; (ii) its adaptive step\nsize is formed not by dividing the square root of second moment estimate but\ninstead by dividing the root of the norm of first moment estimate. As a result,\nAdam$^+$ requires few parameter tuning, as Adam, but it enjoys a provable\nconvergence guarantee. Our analysis further shows that Adam$^+$ enjoys adaptive\nvariance reduction, i.e., the variance of the stochastic gradient estimator\nreduces as the algorithm converges, hence enjoying an adaptive convergence. We\nalso propose a more general variant of Adam$^+$ with different adaptive step\nsizes and establish their fast convergence rate. Our empirical studies on\nvarious deep learning tasks, including image classification, language modeling,\nand automatic speech recognition, demonstrate that Adam$^+$ significantly\noutperforms Adam and achieves comparable performance with best-tuned SGD and\nmomentum SGD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 09:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

On the same line, a novel two-phase approach has been\nproposed to study the supercritical flow with heat transfer deterioration (HTD)\nphenomena. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) multiphase model has been used to analyze\nthe flow, and the simulation result reasonably predicts the wall temperature\npeaks. Moreover, the velocity and turbulent kinetic energy profiles for\ndifferent axial locations explain the occurrence of HTD, and it is on par with\nthe pre-existing numerical method. Besides, the quantitative analysis presented\nin the paper expounds on qualitative understanding. The parametric study of the\nthermophysical properties revealed that the density variation is the primary\ncause of HTD in supercritical flows. So banking on this conclusion, the\npropounded study focuses on the forces generated due to the density variation.\nThis technique equips us with a holistic picture of the supercritical flows. It\nleads to the inference that for no HTD effects to be present, buoyancy and\ninertia forces have to be of comparable magnitude throughout the flow. In\naddition, the pseudo phase change model outclasses the existing research by\nrendering us the volume fraction data. Mapping of this variable reveals a\nsudden jump in the lighter phase's thickness near the wall at the site of HTD,\nwhich is also reflected as a maximum in the nondimensional two-phase thickness\n(P) plot. Nevertheless, this observation is only restricted to HTD caused by\nbuoyancy. In the end, a theoretical expression has been conceptualized for\ncomputing the two-phase thickness (h) value, which can serve as a fundamental\nlength scale in supercritical flows as it marks the region of highest property\ngradient near the wall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 10:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

We show evidences that both the interaction interfaces\nand the soft disordered regions tend to involve roughly the same amino-acids of\nthe protein, and preliminary results suggesting that soft disorder spots those\nsurface regions where new interfaces are progressively accommodated by complex\nformation. Our results suggest that disordered regions not only carry crucial\ninformation about the location of alternative interfaces within complexes, but\nalso of the order of the assembly. We verify these hypotheses in several\nexamples. We finally compare our measures of disorder with several disorder\npredictors, showing that these latter are optimized to predict the residues\nthat are missing in all the alternative structures of a protein, and they are\nnot able to catch the progressive evolution of the disordered regions upon\ncomplex formation.

The shape of this potential is determined by the\nunderlying tree-level potential, dressed by quantum corrections from the scalar\nfield itself and the metric perturbations. Following [1], we compute the\neffective scalar field equations and the corrected Friedmann equations to\nquadratic order in both scalar field, scalar metric and tensor perturbations.\nWe identify the quantum corrections from different sources at leading order in\nslow-roll, and estimate their magnitude in benchmark models of inflation.

As more and more realistic PAs\nwith novel types spring up, it is necessary to develop robust algorithms for\ndetecting unknown attacks even in unseen scenarios. However, deep models\nsupervised by traditional binary loss (e.g., `0' for bonafide vs. `1' for PAs)\nare weak in describing intrinsic and discriminative spoofing patterns.\nRecently, pixel-wise supervision has been proposed for the FAS task, intending\nto provide more fine-grained pixel/patch-level cues. In this paper, we firstly\ngive a comprehensive review and analysis about the existing pixel-wise\nsupervision methods for FAS. Then we propose a novel pyramid supervision, which\nguides deep models to learn both local details and global semantics from\nmulti-scale spatial context. Extensive experiments are performed on five FAS\nbenchmark datasets to show that, without bells and whistles, the proposed\npyramid supervision could not only improve the performance beyond existing\npixel-wise supervision frameworks, but also enhance the model's\ninterpretability (i.e., locating the patch-level positions of PAs more\nreasonably). Furthermore, elaborate studies are conducted for exploring the\nefficacy of different architecture configurations with two kinds of pixel-wise\nsupervisions (binary mask and depth map supervisions), which provides\ninspirable insights for future architecture/supervision design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 11:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

For NAS, we typically have to calculate the\nvalidation accuracy of a large number of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), what is\ncomputationally complex. Predictor-based NAS algorithms address this problem.\nThey train a proxy model that can infer the validation accuracy of DNNs\ndirectly from their network structure. During optimization, the proxy can be\nused to narrow down the number of architectures for which the true validation\naccuracy must be computed, what makes predictor-based algorithms sample\nefficient. Usually, we compute the proxy for all DNNs in the network search\nspace and pick those that maximize the proxy as candidates for optimization.\nHowever, that is intractable in practice, because the search spaces are often\nvery large and contain billions of network architectures. The contributions of\nthis paper are threefold: 1) We define a sample efficiency gain to compare\ndifferent predictor-based NAS algorithms. 2) We conduct experiments on the\nNASBench-101 dataset and show that the sample efficiency of predictor-based\nalgorithms decreases dramatically if the proxy is only computed for a subset of\nthe search space. 3) We show that if we choose the subset of the search space\non which the proxy is evaluated in a smart way, the sample efficiency of the\noriginal predictor-based algorithm that has access to the full search space can\nbe regained. This is an important step to make predictor-based NAS algorithms\nuseful, in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 11:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

The sketched matrix will be much smaller than\nX while preserving most of its properties. Therefore, count-sketch is widely\nused for addressing high-dimensionality challenge in machine learning. However,\nthere are two main limitations of count-sketch: (1) The sketching matrix used\ncount-sketch is generated randomly which does not consider any intrinsic data\nproperties of X. This data-oblivious matrix sketching method could produce a\nbad sketched matrix which will result in low accuracy for subsequent machine\nlearning tasks (e.g.classification); (2) For highly sparse input data,\ncount-sketch could produce a dense sketched data matrix. This dense sketch\nmatrix could make the subsequent machine learning tasks more computationally\nexpensive than on the original sparse data X. To address these two limitations,\nwe first show an interesting connection between count-sketch and k-means\nclustering by analyzing the reconstruction error of the count-sketch method.\nBased on our analysis, we propose to reduce the reconstruction error of\ncount-sketch by using k-means clustering algorithm to obtain the\nlow-dimensional sketched matrix. In addition, we propose to solve k-mean\nclustering using gradient descent with -L1 ball projection to produce a sparse\nsketched matrix. Our experimental results based on six real-life classification\ndatasets have demonstrated that our proposed method achieves higher accuracy\nthan the original count-sketch and other popular matrix sketching algorithms.\nOur results also demonstrate that our method produces a sparser sketched data\nmatrix than other methods and therefore the prediction cost of our method will\nbe smaller than other matrix sketching methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 11:44:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 06:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

Nowadays, thousands of household appliances use integrated smart\ndevices which allow remote monitoring and control and also allow intensive\ncomputational work such as high end AI-integrated smart security systems with\nsustained alerts for the user. The update process of these IoT devices usually\nlack the ability of checking the security of centralized servers, which may be\ncompromised and host malicious firmware files as it is presumed that the\nservers are secure during deployment.

In Europe, the virus spread slowed considerably in the late\nspring due to strict lockdown, but a second wave of the pandemic grew\nthroughout the fall. In this study, we first reconstruct the time evolution of\nthe effective reproduction numbers ${\\cal R}(t)$ for each country by\nintegrating the equations of the classic SIR model. We cluster countries based\non the estimated ${\\cal R}(t)$ through a suitable time series dissimilarity.\nThe result suggests that simple dynamical mechanisms determine how countries\nrespond to changes in COVID-19 case counts. Inspired by these results, we\nextend the SIR model to include a social response to explain the number $X(t)$\nof new confirmed daily cases. As a first-order model, we assume that the social\nresponse is on the form $d_t{\\cal R}=-\\nu (X-X^*)$, where $X^*$ is a threshold\nfor response. The response rate $\\nu$ depends on whether $X^*$ is below or\nabove this threshold, on three parameters $\\nu_1,\\;\\nu_2,\\,\\nu_3,$, and on $t$.\nWhen $X<X^*$, $\\nu= \\nu_1$, describes the effect of relaxed intervention when\nthe incidence rate is low. When $X>X^*$, $\\nu=\\nu_2\\exp{(-\\nu_3t)}$, models the\nimpact of interventions when incidence rate is high. The parameter $\\nu_3$\nrepresents the fatigue, i.e., the reduced effect of intervention as time\npasses. The proposed model reproduces typical evolving patterns of COVID-19\nepidemic waves observed in many countries. Estimating the parameters\n$\\nu_1,\\,\\nu_2,\\,\\nu_3$ and initial conditions, such as ${\\cal R}_0$, for\ndifferent countries helps to identify important dynamics in their social\nresponses. One conclusion is that the leading cause of the strong second wave\nin Europe in the fall of 2020 was not the relaxation of interventions during\nthe summer, but rather the general fatigue to interventions developing in the\nfall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 11:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

The aim of this\nstudy is to probe two parameters of the photospheric magnetic field, both\nderived during the emergence phase of an AR, and to compare them with the flare\nproductivity of the well-developed AR. The parameters are: (i) the index of the\nmagnetic power spectrum (the slope of the spectrum) on the stage of emergence,\nand (ii) the flux emergence rate. Analysis of 243 emerging ARs showed that the\nmagnetic power index increases from values typical for quiet-Sun regions to the\nvalues typical for mature ARs within a day while the emergence proceeds for\nseveral days; frequently, after the increase, the value of the power index\nundulates around some mean value with fluctuations being several time less than\nthe growth of the power index during the emergence onset. For a subset of 34\nflare-productive ARs we found no correlation between the power spectrum index\nat the stage of emergence and flare index derived from the entire interval of\nthe AR's presence on the disc. At the same time, the flux emergence rate\ncorrelates well with the flare index (the Pearson's correlation coefficient is\n0.74).

The research article discusses\nthe experiences of unsupervised training of neural networks to represent\nelements on the 2D latent space based on their electron configurations. To\nemphasize chemical properties of the elements, the original data of electron\nconfigurations has been realigned towards valence orbitals. Recognizing seven\nshells and four subshells, the input data has been arranged as 7x4 images.\nLatent space representation has been performed using a convolutional beta\nvariational autoencoder (beta-VAE). Despite discrete and sparse input data, the\nbeta-VAE disentangles elements of different periods, blocks, groups, and types.\nThe unsupervised representation of elements on the latent space reveals\npairwise symmetries of periods and elements related to the invariance of\nquantum numbers of corresponding elements. In addition, it isolates outliers\nthat turned out to be known cases of Madelung's rule violations for lanthanide\nand actinide elements. Considering the generative capabilities of beta-VAE, the\nsupervised machine learning has been set to find out if there are insightful\npatterns distinguishing electron configurations between real elements and\ndecoded artificial ones. Also, the article addresses the capability of dual\nrepresentation by autoencoders. Conventionally, autoencoders represent\nobservations of input data on the latent space. By transposing and duplicating\noriginal input data, it is possible to represent variables on the latent space\nwhich can lead to the discovery of meaningful patterns among input variables.\nApplying that unsupervised learning for transposed data of electron\nconfigurations, the order of input variables that has been arranged by the\nencoder on the latent space has turned out to exactly match the sequence of\nMadelung's rule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 13:54:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 00:24:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 19:45:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 18:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

The\nnovelty of the proposed method, which we term Sentence Encoder Assembly (SEA),\nis two-fold. First, different from prior art that use only a single common\nspace, SEA supports text-video matching in multiple encoder-specific common\nspaces.

They\ncurrently attract increasing interest since they are versatile and highly\ntunable systems for probing many-body physics quantum phenomena, such as\nsuperfluidity. Superfluid flow of light has already been reported in\nmicrocavity exciton-polariton condensates but clear observation of this\nphenomenon in cavityless systems, that is, for propagating photon fluids,\nremains elusive. In this thesis, we study the hydrodynamical properties of\nlight propagating close to resonance in hot rubidium vapors. Whereas photons in\nair are not interacting with each other, the situation is different in rubidium\nvapors, as an effective interaction between them, mediated by the atomic\nensemble, appears. The light behaves therefore as a fluid flowing in the plane\nperpendicular to the optical axis. The primary purpose of this thesis was to\nshow that light in those systems can behave as a superfluid. The first step\ntoward the observation of superfluidity is to measure the dispersion relation\nof small amplitude density waves travelling onto the propagating photon fluid.\nI show that this dispersion exhibits a linear trend for small excitation\nwave-vectors, which is, according to the Landau criterion, a sufficient\ncondition for guaranteeing superfluidity.

We adhere to the\nassumption of a Froude number so large that choking at the plate edge is\ninsignificant but envisage the variation of the relevant Weber number of O(1).\nThe aspect in the main focus, tackled essentially analytically, is the\ncontinuation of the structure of the flow towards scales much smaller then the\ninteractive ones and where it no longer can be treated as slender. As a\nremarkable phenomenon, this analysis predicts harmonic capillary ripples of\nRayleigh type, prevalent on the free surface upstream of the trailing edge.\nThey exhibit an increase of both the wavelength and amplitude as the\ncharacteristic Weber number decreases. Finally, the theory clarifies the actual\ndetachment process, unprecedented in the rational theories of flow separation.\nAt this stage, the wetting properties of the fluid and the microscopically\nwedge-shaped edge, viewed as infinitely thin on the larger scales, come into\nplay. As this geometry typically models the exit of a spout, the predicted\nwetting of the wedge is related to what in the literature is referred to as the\nso-called teapot effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 15:44:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 21:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

In this paper, we redefine\nthis problem with a more realistic assumption that the query image can be\narbitrary in the area of interest and the reference images are captured before\nthe queries emerge. This assumption breaks the one-to-one retrieval setting of\nexisting datasets as the queries and reference images are not perfectly aligned\npairs, and there may be multiple reference images covering one query location.\nTo bridge the gap between this realistic setting and existing datasets, we\npropose a new large-scale benchmark -- VIGOR -- for cross-View Image\nGeo-localization beyond One-to-one Retrieval.

This study finds that foreign\nfighter recruitment resembles an efficiency-secrecy tradeoff: in places where\nrecruitment needs to be hidden from legal scrutiny, recruitment networks are\ndecentralized; composed of small and more local recruitment cells. These cells\ncan operate more secretly and the group as a whole is more resilient to\ndisruption. In exchange, it is hard for the group to attract large numbers of\nrecruits.

CNNs have been hugely influential in the areas of image\nclassification and image compression, both of which typically deal with data on\nstructured grids. Unstructured meshes are frequently used to solve partial\ndifferential equations and are particularly suitable for problems that require\nthe mesh to conform to complex geometries or for problems that require variable\nmesh resolution.

Along with a rapidly growing amount of location data, machine\nlearning (ML) techniques are becoming widely adopted. A key reason is that ML\ninference is significantly more energy-efficient than GPS query at comparable\naccuracy, and GPS signals can become extremely unreliable for specific\nscenarios. To this end, several techniques such as deep neural networks have\nbeen proposed. However, during training, almost none of them incorporate the\nknown structural information such as floor plan, which can be especially useful\nin indoor or other structured environments. In this paper, we argue that the\nstate-of-the-art-systems are significantly worse in terms of accuracy because\nthey are incapable of utilizing these essential structural information. The\nproblem is incredibly hard because the structural properties are not explicitly\navailable, making most structural learning approaches inapplicable. Given that\nboth input and output space potentially contain rich structures, we study our\nmethod through the intuitions from manifold-projection.

The standard method for\npredicting the absence, presence, and intensity of pain has long been\nself-report. However, medical providers struggle to manage patients based on\nsubjective pain reports correctly and pain medications often lead to further\ndifficulties in patient communication as they may cause sedation and\nsleepiness.

In this study, we evaluate the generalizability of ML\ntechniques to data collected from 50 patients over an extended period across\nthree types of hospital visits (i.e., inpatient, outpatient and outpatient\nevaluation). We compare five classification algorithms for various pain\nintensity levels at both intra-individual (within each patient) and\ninter-individual (between patients) level.

In addition to radiology imaging of tumor tissues,\ndigital pathology imaging, which captures histological details in high spatial\nresolution, is fast becoming a routine clinical procedure for cancer diagnosis\nsupport and treatment planning. Recent developments in deep-learning methods\nfacilitate the segmentation of tumor regions at almost the cellular level from\ndigital pathology images. The traditional shape features that were developed\nfor characterizing tumor boundary roughness in radiology are not applicable.\nReliable statistical approaches to modeling tumor shape in pathology images are\nin urgent need. In this paper, we consider the problem of modeling a tumor\nboundary with a closed polygonal chain. A Bayesian landmark-based shape\nanalysis (BayesLASA) model is proposed to partition the polygonal chain into\nmutually exclusive segments to quantify the boundary roughness piecewise. Our\nfully Bayesian inference framework provides uncertainty estimates of both the\nnumber and locations of landmarks. The BayesLASA outperforms a recently\ndeveloped landmark detection model for planar elastic curves in terms of\naccuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate how this model-based analysis can lead\nto sharper inferences than ordinary approaches through a case study on the 246\npathology images from 143 non-small cell lung cancer patients. The case study\nshows that the heterogeneity of tumor boundary roughness predicts patient\nprognosis (p-value < 0.001). This statistical methodology not only presents a\nnew model for characterizing a digitized object's shape features by using its\nlandmarks, but also provides a new perspective for understanding the role of\ntumor surface in cancer progression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 00:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

The paper proposes a\nsimulation-based optimization (SBO) framework to simultaneously calibrate path\nchoices and train capacity for urban rail systems using AFC and AVL data. The\ncalibration is formulated as an optimization problem with a black-box objective\nfunction. Seven algorithms from four branches of SBO solving methods are\nevaluated. The algorithms are evaluated using an experimental design that\nincludes five scenarios, representing different degrees of path choice\nrandomness and crowding sensitivity. Data from the Hong Kong Mass Transit\nRailway (MTR) system is used as a case study. The data is used to generate\nsynthetic observations used as \"ground truth\". The results show that the\nresponse surface methods (particularly Constrained Optimization using Response\nSurfaces) have consistently good performance under all scenarios. The proposed\napproach drives large-scale simulation applications for monitoring and\nplanning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 17:41:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 00:19:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2022 03:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

Yet, despite extensive methodological progress, many recent studies\nare hampered by the limited access to simple and efficient open-source solution\nmethods. Given the sophistication of current algorithms, reimplementation is\nbecoming a difficult and time-consuming exercise that requires extensive care\nfor details to be truly successful. Against this background, we use the\nopportunity of this short paper to introduce a simple -- open-source --\nimplementation of the hybrid genetic search (HGS) specialized to the\ncapacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). This state-of-the-art algorithm\nuses the same general methodology as Vidal et al. (2012) but also includes\nadditional methodological improvements and lessons learned over the past decade\nof research. In particular, it includes an additional neighborhood called SWAP*\nwhich consists in exchanging two customers between different routes without an\ninsertion in place. As highlighted in our study, an efficient exploration of\nSWAP* moves significantly contributes to the performance of local searches.\nMoreover, as observed in experimental comparisons with other recent approaches\non the classical instances of Uchoa et al. (2017), HGS still stands as a\nleading metaheuristic regarding solution quality, convergence speed, and\nconceptual simplicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 21:37:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 16:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

The\ncurrent work presents a deep learning-based numerical method called\nDeepCombustion0.0 to solve stiff ordinary differential equation systems. The\nhomogeneous autoignition of DME/air mixture, including 54 species, is adopted\nas an example to illustrate the validity and accuracy of the algorithm. The\ntraining and testing datasets cover a wide range of temperature, pressure, and\nmixture conditions between 750-1200 K, 30-50 atm, and equivalence ratio =\n0.7-1.5. Both the first-stage low-temperature ignition (LTI) and the\nsecond-stage high-temperature ignition (HTI) are considered. The methodology\nhighlights the importance of the adaptive data sampling techniques, power\ntransform preprocessing, and binary deep neural network (DNN) design. By using\nthe adaptive random samplings and appropriate power transforms, smooth\nsubmanifolds in the state vector phase space are observed, on which two\nthree-layer DNNs can be appropriately trained. The neural networks are\nend-to-end, which predict temporal gradients of the state vectors directly. The\nresults show that temporal evolutions predicted by DNN agree well with\ntraditional numerical methods in all state vector dimensions, including\ntemperature, pressure, and species concentrations. Besides, the ignition delay\ntime differences are within 1%. At the same time, the CPU time is reduced by\nmore than 20 times and 200 times compared with the HMTS and VODE method,\nrespectively. The current work demonstrates the enormous potential of applying\nthe deep learning algorithm in chemical kinetics and combustion modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 02:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-24"}

Protection of water resources requires the control of\npollution sources that may deteriorate them. This is a challenging task in\nmulti-stressed catchments. This work presents an approach that combines\npesticide occurrence patterns and stable isotope analyses of nitrogen\n(delta15N-NO3-, delta15N-NH4+), oxygen (delta18O-NO3-), and boron (delta11B) to\ndiscriminate the origin of pesticides and nitrogenpollution to tackle this\nchallenge. The approach has been applied to a Mediterranean subcatchment\nsubject to a variety of natural and anthropogenic pressures. Combining the\nresults from both analytical approaches in selected locations of the basin, the\nurban/industrial activity was identified as the main pressure on the quality of\nthe surface water resources, and to a large extent also on the groundwater\nresources, although agriculture may play also an important role, mainly in\nterms of nitrate and ammonium pollution. Total pesticide concentrations in\nsurface waters were one order of magnitude higher than in groundwaters and\nbelieved to originate mainly from soil and/or sediments desorption processes\nand urban and industrial use, as they were mainly associated with treated\nwastewaters. These findings are supported by the stable isotope results, that\npointed to an organic origin of nitrate in surface waters and most groundwater\nsamples. Ammonium pollution observed in some aquifer locations is probably\ngenerated by nitrate reduction. Overall, no significant attenuation processes\ncould be inferred for nitrate pollution. The approach presented here\nexemplifies the investigative monitoring envisioned in the Water Framework\nDirective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 18:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}
