Here we test this hypothesis\nusing a representative panel of more than 300,000 Americans and their\nindividual-level browsing behavior, on and off YouTube, from January 2016\nthrough December 2019. Using a labeled set of political news channels, we find\nthat news consumption on YouTube is dominated by mainstream and largely\ncentrist sources. Consumers of far-right content, while more engaged than\naverage, represent a small and stable percentage of news consumers. However,\nconsumption of anti-woke content, defined in terms of its opposition to\nprogressive intellectual and political agendas, grew steadily in popularity and\nis correlated with consumption of far-right content off-platform. We find no\nevidence that engagement with far-right content is caused by YouTube\nrecommendations systematically, nor do we find clear evidence that anti-woke\nchannels serve as a gateway to the far right. Rather, consumption of political\ncontent on YouTube appears to reflect individual preferences that extend across\nthe web as a whole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 16:00:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 14:59:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

There is, however, no consensus on\nthe origin of this pattern, which may originate from human behaviour rather\nthan from the virus diffusion itself. Time-honoured models of the SIR type or\nothers based on complex networks describe well the exponential spread of the\ndisease, but cannot naturally accommodate the wave pattern. Nevertheless,\nunderstanding this time-structure is of paramount importance in designing\neffective prevention measures. Here we propose a consistent picture of the wave\npattern based on the epidemic Renormalisation Group (eRG) framework, which is\nguided by the global symmetries of the system under time rescaling. We show\nthat the rate of spreading of the disease can be interpreted as a time-dilation\nsymmetry, while the final stage of an epidemic episode corresponds to reaching\na time scale-invariant state. We find that the endemic period between two waves\nis a sign of instability in the system, associated to near-breaking of the time\nscale-invariance. This phenomenon can be described in terms of an eRG model\nfeaturing complex fixed points. Our results demonstrate that the key to control\nthe arrival of the next wave of a pandemic is in the strolling period in\nbetween waves, i.e. when the number of infections grow linearly. Thus, limiting\nthe virus diffusion in this period is the most effective way to prevent or\ndelay the arrival of the next wave.

As a result, 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) plays a\nvital role in autonomous navigation. Most MOT methods use a\ntracking-by-detection pipeline, which includes object detection and data\nassociation processing. However, many approaches detect objects in 2D RGB\nsequences for tracking, which is lack of reliability when localizing objects in\n3D space. Furthermore, it is still challenging to learn discriminative features\nfor temporally-consistent detection in different frames, and the affinity\nmatrix is normally learned from independent object features without considering\nthe feature interaction between detected objects in the different frames. To\nsettle these problems, We firstly employ a joint feature extractor to fuse the\n2D and 3D appearance features captured from both 2D RGB images and 3D point\nclouds respectively, and then propose a novel convolutional operation, named\nRelationConv, to better exploit the correlation between each pair of objects in\nthe adjacent frames, and learn a deep affinity matrix for further data\nassociation.

Cure models are statistical models for\nevent times that take into account that a fraction of the population might\nnever experience the event of interest, this fraction is said to be\n{`}cured{'}. The population survival function in a mixture cure model takes the\nform $S(t) = 1 - \\pi + \\pi\\exp(-\\int_0^t\\alpha(s)\\,d s)$, where $\\pi$ is the\nprobability of being susceptible to the event under study, and $\\alpha(s)$ is\nthe hazard rate of the susceptible fraction. We let both $\\pi$ and $\\alpha(s)$\ndepend on possibly different covariate vectors $X$ and $Z$. The probability\n$\\pi$ is taken to be the logistic function $\\pi(X^{\\prime}\\gamma) =\n1/\\{1+\\exp(-X^{\\prime}\\gamma)\\}$, while we model $\\alpha(s)$ by Aalen's linear\nhazard rate regression model. This model postulates that a susceptible\nindividual has hazard rate function $\\alpha(t;Z) = \\beta_0(t) + \\beta_1(t)Z_1 +\n\\cdots + Z_{q-1}\\beta_{q-1}(t)$ in terms of her covariate values\n$Z_1,\\ldots,Z_{q-1}$. The large-sample properties of our estimators are studied\nby way of parametric models that tend to a semiparametric model as a parameter\n$K \\to \\infty$. For each model in the sequence of parametric models, we assume\nthat the data generating mechanism is parametric, thus simplifying the\nderivation of the estimators, as well as the proofs of consistency and limiting\nnormality. Finally, we use contiguity techniques to switch back to assuming\nthat the data stem from the semiparametric model. This technique for deriving\nand studying estimators in non- and semiparametric settings has previously been\nstudied and employed in the high-frequency data literature, but seems to be\nnovel in survival analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 16:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-26"}

When appropriate amounts of noise are present to\nbring the two observers (human and network) into the same accuracy range, they\nshow very similar dependence on duration or FLOPS, i.e. very similar\nspeed-accuracy tradeoff.

The\ndiffeomorphism class of such a threefold is known to be determined up to\nfinitely many possibilities by the integral middle cohomology and two integral\nforms on the integral second cohomology, namely the cubic cup-product form and\nthe linear form given by cup-product with the second chern class. The question\naddressed in both papers is whether knowledge of these cubic and linear forms\ndetermines the threefold up to finitely many families, that is the moduli of\nsuch threefolds is bounded. If this is true, then in particular the middle\nintegral cohomology would be bounded by knowing these two forms. Crucial to\nthis question is the study of rigid non-movable surfaces on the threefold,\nwhich are the irreducible surfaces that deform with any small deformation of\nthe complex structure of the threefold but for which no multiple moves on the\nthreefold.

The main model of interaction is the message-passing model, where\nprocesses communicate by exchanging messages. Nevertheless, there are several\nmodels varying along important dimensions: degree of synchrony, kinds of\nfaults, number of faults... This variety is compounded by the lack of a general\nformalism in which to abstract these models. One way to bring order is to\nconstrain these models to communicate in rounds. This is the setting of the\nHeard-Of model, which captures many models through predicates on the messages\nsent in a round and received on time. Yet, it is not easy to define the\npredicate that captures a given operational model. The question is even harder\nfor the asynchronous case, as unbounded message delay means the implementation\nof rounds must depend on details of the model. This paper shows that\ncharacterising asynchronous models by heard-of predicates is indeed meaningful.\nThis characterization relies on delivered predicates, an intermediate\nabstraction between the informal operational model and the heard-of predicates.\nOur approach splits the problem into two steps: first extract the delivered\nmodel capturing the informal model, and then characterize the heard-of\npredicates that are generated by this delivered model. For the first part, we\nprovide examples of delivered predicates, and an approach to derive more. It\nuses the intuition that complex models are a composition of simpler models. We\ndefine operations like union, succession or repetition that make it easier to\nderive complex delivered predicates from simple ones while retaining\nexpressivity. For the second part, we formalize and study strategies for when\nto change rounds. Intuitively, the characterizing predicate of a model is the\none generated by a strategy that waits for as much messages as possible,\nwithout blocking forever.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 16:57:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 15:28:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 07:10:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 16:57:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

As a common practice, most existing methods predict LQE\nscores through vanilla convolutional features shared with object classification\nor bounding box regression. In this paper, we explore a completely novel and\ndifferent perspective to perform LQE -- based on the learned distributions of\nthe four parameters of the bounding box. The bounding box distributions are\ninspired and introduced as \"General Distribution\" in GFLV1, which describes the\nuncertainty of the predicted bounding boxes well. Such a property makes the\ndistribution statistics of a bounding box highly correlated to its real\nlocalization quality. Specifically, a bounding box distribution with a sharp\npeak usually corresponds to high localization quality, and vice versa. By\nleveraging the close correlation between distribution statistics and the real\nlocalization quality, we develop a considerably lightweight Distribution-Guided\nQuality Predictor (DGQP) for reliable LQE based on GFLV1, thus producing GFLV2.\nTo our best knowledge, it is the first attempt in object detection to use a\nhighly relevant, statistical representation to facilitate LQE.

In microgravity environments, stick-slip behaviors are\nnegligible, and we find that faster probe insertion can suppress stick-slip\nbehaviors where they are present. We conclude that the mechanical response of\nregolith on rubble pile asteroids is likely quite distinct from that found on\nlarger planetary objects, and scaling terrestrial experiments to microgravity\nconditions may not capture the full physical dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 17:14:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 23:56:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 01:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-15"}

The proposed solution builds on the factorization performed by\nSAIS during suffix sorting. A context-free grammar is used to replace factors\nby non-terminals. The algorithm is then recursively applied on the shorter\nsequence of non-terminals. The resulting grammar is encoded by exploiting some\nredundancies, such as common prefixes between right-hands of rules, sorted\naccording to SAIS. GCIS excels for its low space and time required for\ncompression while obtaining competitive compression ratios. Our experiments on\nregular and repetitive, moderate and very large texts, show that GCIS stands as\na very convenient choice compared to well-known compressors such as Gzip,\n7-Zip, and RePair, the gold standard in grammar compression. In exchange, GCIS\nis slow at decompressing. Yet, grammar compressors are more convenient than\nLempel-Ziv compressors in that one can access text substrings directly in\ncompressed form, without ever decompressing the text. We demonstrate that GCIS\nis an excellent candidate for this scenario because it shows to be competitive\namong its RePair based alternatives.

In summary, the Gaussian Lyot coronagraph is the\noption to serve all those science cases requiring field-stabilization and\nmoderate contrast.

To this end, we consider a realistic\nPETE device composed of a boron-doped silicon emitter on glass and a\nphosphorus-doped diamond collector on tungsten separated by the inter-electrode\nvacuum gap. Depth-dependent spectral solar absorption and its photovoltaic and\nphotothermal energy conversion processes are rigorously calculated to predict\nthe PETE power output and energy conversion efficiency. Our calculation\npredicts that when optimized, the power output of the considered PETE device\ncan reach 1.6 W/cm$^2$ with the energy conversion efficiency of $\\sim$18 \\% for\n100$\\times$ solar concentration, which is substantially lower than those\npredicted in previous works under ideal conditions. In addition, the\nphoton-enhancement ratio is lower than 10 and decreases with the increasing\nsolar concentration due to the photothermal heating of the emitter, suggesting\nthat PETE may be an adequate energy conversion process for low-to-medium CSP\nbelow $\\sim$100$\\times$ concentration. These observations signify the\nimportance of a rigorous energy balance analysis based on spectral and spatial\nsolar absorption distribution for the accurate prediction of PETE power\ngeneration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 17:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

This is a problem in\nmany parts of the world, but it is more prominent in low-income countries,\nwhere in 2014 on average 65% of the urban population lived in slums. As a\nresult, building resilient communities requires quantifying the population\nliving in these deprived areas and improving their living conditions. However,\nmost of the data about slums comes from census data, which is only available at\naggregate levels and often excludes these settlements. Consequently,\nresearchers have looked at alternative approaches. These approaches, however,\ncommonly rely on expensive high-resolution satellite imagery and field-surveys,\nwhich hinders their large-scale applicability. In this paper, we investigate a\ncost-effective methodology to estimate the slum population by assessing the\nquality of gridded population data. We evaluate the accuracy of the WorldPOP\nand LandScan population layers against ground-truth data composed of 1,703\ngeoreferenced polygons that were mapped as deprived areas and which had their\npopulation surveyed during the 2010 Brazilian census. While the LandScan data\ndid not produce satisfactory results for most polygons, the WorldPOP estimates\nwere less than 20% off for 67% of the polygons and the overall error for the\ntotality of the studied area was only -5.9%. This small error margin\ndemonstrates that population layers with a resolution of at least a 100m, such\nas WorldPOP's, can be useful tools to estimate the population living in slums.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 18:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-26"}

The paper mainly investigates two ways of improving the method: by\nusing locally connected layers, which can make the network less invariant to\ntranslation, and tiled convolution, which allows for the learning of more\ncomplex invariances than standard convolution. Furthermore, the use of the Fast\nFourier Transform can improve the computational efficiency of convolution.\nSubsequently, this paper discusses two applications of convolution that have\nproven to be very effective in practice.

The optimum solution may require dividing the\navailable resources among several GIC (each called a \"constituent region\",\nhereafter) and apply time-sharing among them. The current article focuses on a\nsingle constituent region (meaning the constraints on resources are all\nsatisfied with equality) for a 2-users weak GIC. It is shown that, by relying\non a different, intuitively straightforward, interpretation of the underlying\noptimization problem, one can determine the encoding/decoding strategies in the\nprocess of computing the optimum solution. This is based on gradually moving\nalong the boundary of the capacity region in infinitesimal steps, where the\nsolution for the end point in each step is optimized relying on the solution at\nthe step's starting point. This approach enables proving Gaussian distribution\nis optimum over the entire boundary, and also allows finding simple closed form\nsolutions describing different parts of the capacity region. The solution for\neach constituent 2-users GIC coincides with the optimum solution to the Han\nKobayashi (HK) system of constraints with i.i.d.

Contrary to\nprevious research on adversarially trained models, we found that the accuracy\nof such models was equal to standard models when sufficiently large datasets\nand dual batch norm training were used. To ensure transferability, we\nadditionally validated our results on an external test set of 22,433 X-rays.\nThese findings elucidate that different paths for adversarial and real images\nare needed during training to achieve state of the art results with superior\nclinical interpretability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 20:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

The radio light curve is dominated by synchrotron emission over\nthese seven years, and shows four distinct radio flares. Resolved radio images\nobtained in the VLA A configuration show that the synchrotron emission hugs the\nequatorial disc, and comparisons to near-IR images of the nova clearly\ndemonstrate that it is the densest ejecta, not the fastest ejecta, that are the\nsites of the synchrotron emission in V445 Pup. The data are consistent with a\nmodel where the synchrotron emission is produced by a wind from the white dwarf\nimpacting the dense equatorial disc, resulting in shocks and particle\nacceleration. The individual synchrotron flares may be associated with density\nenhancements in the equatorial disc and/ or velocity variations in the wind\nfrom the white dwarf.

The nonlinear dependence of the\namplitude mode oscillations on the THz driving fields is distinct from any\none-band and conventional SC results: we observe a large nonlinear change of\nresonance strength, yet with a persisting mode frequency. We argue that this\nresult provides compelling evidence for a transient coupling between the\nelectron and hole amplitude modes via strong interband coherent interaction. To\nsupport this scenario, we perform quantum kinetic modeling of a hybrid Higgs\nmechanism without invoking extra disorder or phonons.

We\npartition the spatial domain into disjoint subregions and fit locally\nnonstationary models using a carefully curated set of spatial basis functions.\nThen, we combine the local processes using a novel neighbor-based weighting\nscheme.

All\nstabilizers are optimal, which stabilize the logic systems from any initial\nstate to the destination state/state set in the shortest time.

An example might be a highly dissonant chord played by\nmistake in a classical-era sonata, or a sudden off-key note in a recurring\nmotif. The problem of identifying and correcting such errors can be approached\nwith artificial intelligence -- if a trained human can easily do it, maybe a\ncomputer can be trained to spot the errors quickly and just as accurately. The\nability to identify and auto-correct errors in real-time would be not only\nextremely useful to performing musicians, but also a valuable asset for\nproducers, allowing much fewer overdubs and re-recording of takes due to small\nimperfections. This paper examines state-of-the-art solutions to related\nproblems and explores novel solutions for music error detection and correction,\nfocusing on their real-time applicability. The explored approaches consider\nerror detection through music context and theory, as well as supervised\nlearning models with no predefined musical information or rules, trained on\nappropriate datasets. Focusing purely on correcting musical errors, the\npresented solutions operate on a high-level representation of the audio (MIDI)\ninstead of the raw audio domain, taking input from an electronic instrument\n(MIDI keyboard/piano) and altering it when needed before it is sent to the\nsampler. This work proposes multiple general recurrent neural network designs\nfor real-time error correction and performance aid for MIDI instruments,\ndiscusses the results, limitations, and possible future improvements. It also\nemphasizes on making the research results easily accessible to the end user -\nmusic enthusiasts, producers and performers -- by using the latest artificial\nintelligence platforms and tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 04:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

In one-dimensional space, the output must be one agent's\nlocation, which is easy to prove in any $n$ agents.

A general feature of FDM models is the presence of ubiquitous density\nfluctuations in bound, virialized dark matter structures, on the scale of the\nde Broglie wavelength, arising from wave interference in the evolving dark\nmatter distribution. These time-varying fluctuations can disturb the motions of\nstars, leading to potentially observable signatures in cold thin tidal streams\nin our own Galaxy. The study of this effect has been hindered by the difficulty\nin simulating the FDM wavefunction in Milky Way-sized systems. We present a\nsimple method to evolve realistic wavefunctions in nearly static potentials,\nthat should provide an accurate estimate of this granulation effect. We\nquantify the impact of FDM perturbations on tidal streams, and show that\ninitially, while stream perturbations are small in amplitude, their power\nspectra exhibit a sharp cutoff corresponding to the de Broglie wavelength of\nthe FDM potential fluctuations. Eventually, when stream perturbations become\nnonlinear, fold caustics generically arise that lead to density fluctuations\nwith universal behavior. This erases the signature of the de Broglie wavelength\nin the stream density power spectrum, but we show that it will still be\npossible to determine the FDM mass in this regime, by considering the\nfluctuations in quantities like angular momenta or actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 06:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

As a concrete alternative,\nthermal 2-2-holes closely resemble black holes without event horizons. Being a\nprobable endpoint of gravitational collapse, they not only provide a resolution\nto the information loss problem, but also naturally give rise to stable\nremnants. Previously, we have considered primordial 2-2-hole remnants as dark\nmatter. Due to the strong constraints from a novel phenomenon associated with\nremnant mergers, only small remnants with close to the Planck mass can\nconstitute all of dark matter. In this paper, we examine the scenario that the\nmajority of dark matter consists of particles produced by the evaporation of\nprimordial 2-2-holes, whereas the remnant contribution is secondary. The\nproducts with light enough mass may contribute to the number of relativistic\ndegrees of freedom in the early universe, which we also calculate. Moreover,\n2-2-hole evaporation can produce particles that are responsible for the baryon\nasymmetry. We find that baryogenesis through direct B-violating decays or\nthrough leptogenesis can both be realized. Overall, the viable parameter space\nfor the Planck remnant case is similar to primordial black holes with Planck\nremnants. Heavier remnants, on the other hand, lead to different predictions,\nand the viable parameter space remains large even when the remnant abundance is\nsmall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 06:55:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 04:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

The exact Higgs alignment\nlimit can arise naturally due to a global symmetry of the scalar potential. If\nthis symmetry is softly broken, then the Higgs alignment limit becomes\napproximate (although still potentially consistent with the current LHC Higgs\ndata). In this paper, we obtain the approximate Higgs alignment suggested by\nthe LHC Higgs data as a consequence of a softly broken global symmetry of the\nHiggs Lagrangian. However, this can only be accomplished if the Yukawa sector\nof the theory is extended. We propose an extended 2HDM with vector-like top\nquark partners, where explicit mass terms in the top sector provide the source\nof the soft symmetry breaking of a generalized CP symmetry.

We argue that this kind of \\textbf{state\ndriven visual reasoning} approach has limitations in reflecting whether the\nmachine has the ability to infer the dynamics between different states, which\nhas been shown as important as state-level reasoning for human cognition in\nPiaget's theory. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel\n\\textbf{transformation driven visual reasoning} task.

Aims:\nWe want to understand and quantify the role of the water snow line for the\nformation of rock-rich and ice-rich planetesimals. In this paper, we focus on\nthe formation of rock-rich planetesimals. A companion paper examines the\ncombined formation of both rock-rich and ice-rich planetesimals. Methods: We\ndevelop a new Monte Carlo code to calculate the radial evolution of silicate\nparticles in a turbulent accretion disk, accounting for the back-reaction\n(i.e., inertia) of the particles on their radial drift velocity and diffusion.\nResults depend in particular on the particle injection width (determined from\nthe radial sublimation width of icy pebbles), the pebble scale height and the\npebble mass flux through the disk.

Investigating this shortcoming, the\nconcept of the long tail of business processes suggests a hybrid approach that\nentails managing important processes centrally, while incrementally improving\nthe majority of processes at their place of execution. This study scrutinizes\nthis observation as well as corresponding implications. First, we define a\nsystem of indicators to automatically prioritize processes based on execution\ndata.

Compared to\nthe conventional Bosonic Josephson junction (BJJ) condensate system, we show\nthat the SJJ-model in quantum domain exhibits unusual features due to its\neffective nonlinear strength proportional to the square of total particle\nnumber, $N^2$. A novel self-tuning effect for the effective tunneling parameter\nis also demonstrated in the SJJ-model, which depends on the particle number and\nrapidly vanishes as the JJ population imbalance increases.

To investigate the evolution of nematic fluctuations in such a case,\nwe present elastoresistance and elastic modulus measurements in\nCaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$)$_{4}$As$_{4}$ ($x = 0-0.05$) combined with\nphenomenological modeling and density functional theory. We find clear\nexperimental signatures of considerable nematic fluctuations, including\nsoftening of the Young's modulus $Y_{[110]}$ and a Curie-Weiss type divergence\nof the B2g elastoresistance coefficient in\nCaK(Fe$_{0.951}$Ni$_{0.049}$)$_4$As$_4$. Overall, nematic fluctuations within\nthis series bear strong similarities to the hole-doped\nBa$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ series, including a substitution-induced sign\nchange. Our theoretical analysis addresses the effect of the specific crystal\nsymmetry of the 1144-type structure in determining its magnetic ground state\nand on the nematic fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 10:07:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

(2020,\ndoi:10.1029/2020GL088101) that, after the Australian event, part of this smoke\nself-organized as anticyclonic confined vortices that rose in the mid-latitude\nstratosphere up to 35 km. Based on CALIOP observations and the ERA5 reanalysis,\nthis new study analyzes the Canadian case and find, similarly, that a large\nplume penetrated the stratosphere by 12 August 2017 and got trapped within a\nmeso-scale anticyclonic structure which travelled across the Atlantic. It then\nbroke into three offsprings that could be followed until mid-October performing\nthree round the world journeys and rising up to 23 km. We analyze the dynamical\nstructure of the vortices produced by these two wildfires and demonstrate how\nthey are maintained by the assimilation of data from instruments measuring the\nsignature of the vortices in the temperature and ozone field. We propose that\nthese vortices can be seen as bubbles of low absolute potential vorticity and\nsmoke carried vertically across the stratification from the troposphere inside\nthe middle stratosphere by their internal heating, against the descending flux\nof the Brewer-Dobson circulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 11:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

Besides, its global mask representation often leads to superior\naccuracy to the two-stage Mask R-CNN which has been dominant thus far. Despite\nthe promising advances in single-stage methods, finer delineation of instance\nboundaries still remains unexcavated. Indeed, boundary information provides a\nstrong shape representation that can operate in synergy with the\nfully-convolutional mask features of the single-stage segmenter. In this work,\nwe propose Boundary Basis based Instance Segmentation(B2Inst) to learn a global\nboundary representation that can complement existing global-mask-based methods\nthat are often lacking high-frequency details. Besides, we devise a unified\nquality measure of both mask and boundary and introduce a network block that\nlearns to score the per-instance predictions of itself.

The observed two-dimensional maps reveal an OH\nfield that has a non-linear dependence on excitation frequency. This study\nprovides new insight into earlier reports of so-called avoidance and tracking,\nshowing two distinct NSP responses directly by the addition of a emission\nenergy axis. The data show that the polarization processes depend on which\nelectron spin state is optically driven, with surprising differences in the\npolarization fluctuations for each case: in one case, a stabilized field\ncharacterized by a single-peaked distribution shifts monotonically with the\nlaser excitation frequency resulting in a nearly constant optical interaction\nstrength across a wide detuning range, while in the other case the previously\nreported avoidance behavior is actually the result of a nonlinear dependence on\nthe laser excitation frequency near zero detuning leading to switching between\ntwo distinct mesoscopic nuclear spin states. The magnitude of the field, which\nis as large as 400 mT, is measured with sub-100 nuclear spin sensitivity.\nStable/unstable points of the OH field distribution are observed, resulting\nfrom the non-linear feedback loop in the electron-trion-nuclear system.

This time\nscales proportionally with the diameter of the quantum mechanical object, on\nwhich the measured observable acts non-trivially, with the proportionality\nconstant being around $10^{-5}$ s/m. We confirm our bound by comparison with\nexperimentally reported measurement times for different platforms.

Observing that\nin semantic segmentation, some layers' feature activations of each channel tend\nto encode saliency of scene categories (analogue to class activation mapping),\nwe propose to align features channel-wise between the student and teacher\nnetworks.

These results are\nconsistent with the latest most accurate measurements of the neutron decay\nasymmetry within the Standard Model. However, there is a significant\ndiscrepancy at $3.6\\sigma$ (1% of the decay probability) level between the\naveraged result of the storage method experiments and the most accurate\nmeasurements performed with the beam method. This article addresses the\npossible causes of such discrepancy. We focused on finding the spectrum of\npossible systematic corrections in the beam experiment. Four separate sources\nof the systematic errors which had not been properly addressed in articles\ndedicated to the beam technique were considered. Two of those sources are\nrelated with the motion of protons in an electromagnetic field and the elastic\nscattering by the residual gas. The third error concerns proton loss in the\ndead layer of the detector. It is shown the corresponding correction requires a\nmore detailed analysis than that given in the papers describing the beam\nmeasurement method. The fourth source of the systematic error is the charge\nexchange process on the residual gas. The influence of that process was\nneglected in the beam method experiments. We present arguments that careful\nanalysis of this issue is necessary since the proposed proton losses correction\ndecreases the measured lifetime. For the problem of proton charge exchange on a\nresidual gas, the spectrum of possible corrections is investigated. It is shown\nthat for an accurate calculation of the correction, it is necessary to directly\nmeasure the concentration and composition of the residual gas inside the proton\ntrap. The analysis reveals that even presence of only $H_2$ molecules can lead\nto the significant correction which is the most probable explanation of the\nneutron anomaly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 13:14:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 09:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

Among various approaches, skeleton-based methods\nrecently attract increasing attention due to their robust and superior\nperformance. However, existing skeleton-based methods ignore the potential\naction relationships between different persons, while the action of a person is\nhighly likely to be impacted by another person especially in complex events. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel group-skeleton-based human action recognition\nmethod in complex events. This method first utilizes multi-scale\nspatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (MS-G3Ds) to extract skeleton\nfeatures from multiple persons. In addition to the traditional key point\ncoordinates, we also input the key point speed values to the networks for\nbetter performance. Then we use multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to embed the\ndistance values between the reference person and other persons into the\nextracted features. Lastly, all the features are fed into another MS-G3D for\nfeature fusion and classification. For avoiding class imbalance problems, the\nnetworks are trained with a focal loss. The proposed algorithm is also our\nsolution for the Large-scale Human-centric Video Analysis in Complex Events\nChallenge. Results on the HiEve dataset show that our method can give superior\nperformance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 13:19:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 03:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

We advocate that\ngeneric patches could provide at the same time a unified representation and a\nspecification for fix patterns. Generic patches are indeed formally defined,\nand there exists a robust, industry-adapted, and extensible engine that\nprocesses generic patches to perform control-flow code matching and\nautomatically generates concretes patches based on the specified change\noperations. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a repair\nframework, FLEXIREPAIR, that explores generic patches as the core concept.

For a low applied current density j, the deposit grows\nunder the form of ramified branches. As shown by Fleury (Nature, 390,, 1997),\nthese branches are composed of small metallic crystals. This microstructure is\nbuilt up by a re-nucleation process induced by the dynamics of a space charge\nregion (non-electrically neutral solution) ahead of the growth front. When\nincreasing j the crystal size decreases whereas the nucleation frequency\nincreases. These latter tendencies are reversed for high j when, as\nexperimentally observed, dendrites are formed instead of ramified branches.\nThere must be a transition between the nucleation/growth regime (ramified\nbranches) and the pure growth regime (dendrites). This transition is examined\nexperimentally by carefully observing the branch microstructure by SEM. For\ncopper and silver branches, when j is lower than a critical current density j_c\n(concentration-dependent), the branches are composed only of non-dendritic\ncrystals. Whereas, when j>j_c, dendritic crystals are observed and they become\nthe main kind of crystals constituting the branches for higher j. These\nobservations show that the morphological transition on the pattern scale,\nbetween ramified branches and dendrites, originates from a morphological\ntransition on the scale of the crystals constituting the branches. This latter\nis considered theoretically by analyzing the shape stability of the growing\ncrystals. The Mullins & Sekerka model (shape stability of a spherical particle\ngrowing by diffusion) disagrees with these observations by predicting that the\ncrystals are always unstable. It is proposed that the space charge layer,\nsurrounding the growing crystals, induces a stabilizing effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 13:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

In the Lagrange planetary equations for the evolution of the instantaneous\norbital elements, second-order effects arise from obtaining the first-order\nsolution for each element, consisting of a constant (or slowly varying) piece\nand an oscillatory perturbative piece, and reinserting it back into the\nequations to obtain a second-order solution. After an average over the two\norbital timescales to obtain long-term evolutions, these second-order\nquadrupole ($Q^2$) terms would be expected to produce effects of order\n$(a/A)^6$.

We perform numerical simulations of the evolution of the cosmic web\nfor the conventional LCDM model.

In this context,\nthe launch of SVOM in mid-2022, with its two wide-field high-energy instruments\nECLAIRs and GRM, will foster the possibilities of coincidental transient\ndetection with gravitational waves and gamma-rays events. The purpose of this\npaper is to assess the ability of SVOM/ECLAIRs to detect and quickly\ncharacterize high-energy transients in the local Universe (z<0.3), and to\ndiscuss the contribution of this instrument to multi-messenger astronomy and to\ngamma-ray burst(GRB) astrophysics in the 2020s. A list of local HE transients,\nalong with their main characteristics, is constructed through an extensive\nliterature survey. The detectability of these transients with ECLAIRs is\nassessed with detailed simulations using tools developed for the SVOM mission,\nincluding a GEANT4 simulation of the energy response and a simulated trigger\nalgorithm representative of the onboard trigger algorithm. The SNR for almost\nall detections will be sufficiently high to allow the on-board ECLAIRs trigger\nalgorithm to detect and derive the localisation of the transient, transmitting\nit to the SVOM satellite and ground-based instruments. Coupled with the\nanti-solar pointing strategy of SVOM, this will enable an optimal follow-up of\nthe events, allowing the observation of their afterglows, supernovae/kilonovae\ncounterparts, and host galaxies.

As the model is similar (but not\nequivalent to) the Biot poromechanics problem, we follow the abundant\nliterature for solvers of the latter equations, developing two approaches that\nresemble the well known undrained and fixed-stress splits for the Biot model.

Humans, however, have learned to predict\nmovements intuitively and to avoid obstacles in a forward-looking way. The task\nof collision avoidance can be divided into a global and a local level.\nRegarding the global level, we propose an approach called \"Predictive Collision\nManagement Path Planning\" (PCMP). At the local level, solutions for collision\navoidance are used that prevent an inevitable collision. Therefore, the aim of\nPCMP is to avoid unnecessary local collision scenarios using predictive\ncollision management. PCMP is a graph-based algorithm with a focus on the time\ndimension consisting of three parts: (1) movement prediction, (2) integration\nof movement prediction into a time-dependent graph, and (3) time and\nrisk-dependent path planning. The algorithm combines the search for a shortest\npath with the question: is the detour worth avoiding a possible collision\nscenario? We evaluate the evasion behavior in different simulation scenarios\nand the results show that a risk-sensitive agent can avoid 47.3% of the\ncollision scenarios while making a detour of 1.3%. A risk-averse agent avoids\nup to 97.3% of the collision scenarios with a detour of 39.1%. Thus, an agent's\nevasive behavior can be controlled actively and risk-dependent using PCMP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 14:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

Unlike existing works that employ fully-supervised training with\npolygon annotations, this study proposes an unconstrained text detection system\ntermed Polygon-free (PF), in which most existing polygon-based text detectors\n(e.g., PSENet [33],DB [16]) are trained with only upright bounding box\nannotations. Our core idea is to transfer knowledge from synthetic data to real\ndata to enhance the supervision information of upright bounding boxes. This is\nmade possible with a simple segmentation network, namely Skeleton Attention\nSegmentation Network (SASN), that includes three vital components (i.e.,\nchannel attention, spatial attention and skeleton attention map) and one soft\ncross-entropy loss. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed Polygonfree\nsystem can combine general detectors (e.g., EAST, PSENet, DB) to yield\nsurprisingly high-quality pixel-level results with only upright bounding box\nannotations on a variety of datasets (e.g., ICDAR2019-Art, TotalText,\nICDAR2015). For example, without using polygon annotations, PSENet achieves an\n80.5% F-score on TotalText [3] (vs. 80.9% of fully supervised counterpart),\n31.1% better than training directly with upright bounding box annotations, and\nsaves 80%+ labeling costs.

Recently, graph convolutional networks\n(GCNs) have been widely used for this task due to their powerful capability to\nmodel graph data. The topology of the adjacency graph is a key factor for\nmodeling the correlations of the input skeletons. Thus, previous methods mainly\nfocus on the design/learning of the graph topology. But once the topology is\nlearned, only a single-scale feature and one transformation exist in each layer\nof the networks. Many insights, such as multi-scale information and multiple\nsets of transformations, that have been proven to be very effective in\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs), have not been investigated in GCNs. The\nreason is that, due to the gap between graph-structured skeleton data and\nconventional image/video data, it is very challenging to embed these insights\ninto GCNs.

This is achieved by\nmultiplying the cohesion and gradient energies by the local ratio of the crack\nsurface areas in the deformed and undeformed configurations and with the\ngradient energy in terms of the gradient of the order parameter in the\nreference configuration. This results in an expression for the surface stresses\nwhich is consistent with the sharp surface approach. Namely, the structural\npart of the Cauchy surface stress represents an isotropic biaxial tension, with\nthe magnitude of a force per unit length equal to the surface energy. The\nsurface stresses are a result of the geometric nonlinearities, even when\nstrains are infinitesimal. They make multiple contributions to the\nGinzburg-Landau equation for damage evolution, both in the deformed and\nundeformed configurations. Important connections between material parameters\nare obtained using an analytical solution for two separating surfaces, as well\nas an analysis of the stress-strain curves for homogeneous tension for\ndifferent degradation and interpolation functions. A complete system of\nequations is presented in the undeformed and deformed configurations.

We find a mainly poloidal and axisymmetric field\nof 475 G, featuring, in particular, a dipole of 450 G tilted at 19{\\deg} to the\nrotation axis. Moreover, we detect a strong differential rotation of d$\\Omega =\n0.167 \\pm 0.009$ rad/d shearing the large-scale field, about twice stronger\nthan that shearing the brightness distribution, suggesting that both\nobservables probe different layers of the convective zone. Even though we\ncaution that more RV measurements are needed to accurately pin down the planet\nmass, AU Mic b already appears as a prime target for constraining planet\nformation models, studying the interactions with the surrounding debris disk,\nand characterizing its atmosphere with upcoming space- and ground-based\nmissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 15:44:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

Nonetheless, accurate modeling\nand recognition of human faces in real world scenarios `on the wild' or under\nadverse conditions remains an open problem. When unconstrained faces are mapped\ninto deep features, variations such as illumination, pose, occlusion, etc., can\ncreate inconsistencies in the resultant feature space. Hence, deriving\nconclusions based on direct associations could lead to degraded performance.\nThis rises the requirement for a basic feature space analysis prior to face\nrecognition.

Results. ARK-RT is able to reproduce standard tests in\nboth free-streaming and diffusive limits, including purely radiative tests and\nradiation hydrodynamics ones. Using a time-implicit solver is profitable as\nsoon as the time step given by the hydrodynamics is 50-100 times larger than\nthe explicit time step for radiative transfer, depending on the preconditioner\nand the architecture.

Due to the inherent nature of the modality to emphasize soft\ntissues of the body, common thresholding algorithms are ineffective in\ndetecting bones in MR images. On the other hand, it is relatively easier to\nsegment bones from CT images because of the high contrast between bones and the\nsurrounding regions. For this reason, we perform a cross-modality synthesis\nbetween MR and CT domains for simple thresholding-based segmentation of the\nvertebral bones. However, this implicitly assumes the availability of paired\nMR-CT data, which is rare, especially in the case of scoliotic patients. In\nthis paper, we present a completely unsupervised, fully three-dimensional (3D)\ncross-modality synthesis method for segmenting scoliotic spines. A 3D CycleGAN\nmodel is trained for an unpaired volume-to-volume translation across MR and CT\ndomains. Then, the Otsu thresholding algorithm is applied to the synthesized CT\nvolumes for easy segmentation of the vertebral bones. The resulting\nsegmentation is used to reconstruct a 3D model of the spine. We validate our\nmethod on 28 scoliotic vertebrae in 3 patients by computing the\npoint-to-surface mean distance between the landmark points for each vertebra\nobtained from pre-operative X-rays and the surface of the segmented vertebra.\nOur study results in a mean error of 3.41 $\\pm$ 1.06 mm.

The pervasiveness of graphs today has raised the demand for\nalgorithms that can answer various questions: Which products would a user like\nto purchase given her order list? Which users are buying fake followers to\nincrease their public reputation? Myriads of new graph mining algorithms are\nproposed every year to answer such questions - each with a distinct problem\nformulation, computational time, and memory footprint. This lack of unity makes\nit difficult for a practitioner to compare different algorithms and pick the\nmost suitable one for a specific application. These challenges - even more\nsevere for non-experts - create a gap in which state-of-the-art techniques\ndeveloped in academic settings fail to be optimally deployed in real-world\napplications. To bridge this gap, we propose AUTOGM, an automated system for\ngraph mining algorithm development. We first define a unified framework\nUNIFIEDGM that integrates various message-passing based graph algorithms,\nranging from conventional algorithms like PageRank to graph neural networks.\nThen UNIFIEDGM defines a search space in which five parameters are required to\ndetermine a graph algorithm. Under this search space, AUTOGM explicitly\noptimizes for the optimal parameter set of UNIFIEDGM using Bayesian\nOptimization. AUTOGM defines a novel budget-aware objective function for the\noptimization to incorporate a practical issue - finding the best speed-accuracy\ntrade-off under a computation budget - into the graph algorithm generation\nproblem. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that AUTOGM\ngenerates novel graph mining algorithms with the best speed/accuracy trade-off\ncompared to existing models with heuristic parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 02:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

Using a software vulnerability detection use case, we evaluate\nthe models' ability to capture the correct vulnerability signals to produce\ntheir predictions. Our prediction-preserving input minimization (P2IM) approach\nsystematically reduces the original source code to a minimal snippet which a\nmodel needs to maintain its prediction. The model's reliance on incorrect\nsignals is then uncovered when the vulnerability in the original code is\nmissing in the minimal snippet, both of which the model however predicts as\nbeing vulnerable. We measure the signal awareness of models using a new metric\nwe propose- Signal-aware Recall (SAR). We apply P2IM on three different neural\nnetwork architectures across multiple datasets. The results show a sharp drop\nin the model's Recall from the high 90s to sub-60s with the new metric,\nhighlighting that the models are presumably picking up a lot of noise or\ndataset nuances while learning their vulnerability detection logic. Although\nthe drop in model performance may be perceived as an adversarial attack, but\nthis isn't P2IM's objective. The idea is rather to uncover the signal-awareness\nof a black-box model in a data-driven manner via controlled queries. SAR's\npurpose is to measure the impact of task-agnostic model training, and not to\nsuggest a shortcoming in the Recall metric. The expectation, in fact, is for\nSAR to match Recall in the ideal scenario where the model truly captures\ntask-specific signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 20:05:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 21:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

Assume that broadcast companies need to spread the signal in graphs by\nusing broadcast stations with varying signal strength so that the signal could\nbe sent to all the vertices. However, broadcast stations with stronger signal\nare generally more expensive.

Early identification of\nthese indications is necessary to change the treatment strategy. Biomarkers\nplay an essential role in this aspect. The survival chance of a patient is\ndependent on the biomarker, and the treatment strategy also differs\naccordingly, e.g., the survival prediction of breast cancer patients diagnosed\nwith HER2 positive status is different from the same with HER2 negative status.\nThis results in a different treatment strategy. So, the heterogeneity of the\nbiomarker statuses or levels should be taken into consideration while modelling\nthe survival outcome. This heterogeneity factor which is often unobserved, is\ncalled frailty. When multiple indications are present simultaneously, the\nscenario becomes more complex as only one of them can occur, which will censor\nthe occurrence of other events. Incorporating independent frailties of each\nbiomarker status for every cause of indications will not depict the complete\npicture of heterogeneity. The events indicating cancer progression are likely\nto be inter-related. So, the correlation should be incorporated through the\nfrailties of different events. In our study, we considered a multiple events or\nrisks model with a heterogeneity component. Based on the estimated variance of\nthe frailty, the threshold levels of a biomarker are utilised as early\ndetection tool of the disease progression or death. Additive-gamma frailty\nmodel is considered to account the correlation between different frailty\ncomponents and estimation of parameters are performed using\nExpectation-Maximization Algorithm. With the extensive algorithm in R, we have\nobtained the threshold levels of activity of a biomarker in a multiple events\nscenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 13:14:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 14:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

This paper explores the\neffect of various popular image enhancement techniques and states the effect of\neach of them on the detection performance. We have compiled the largest X-ray\ndataset called COVQU-20, consisting of 18,479 normal, non-COVID lung opacity\nand COVID-19 CXR images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest\npublic COVID positive database. Ground glass opacity is the common symptom\nreported in COVID-19 pneumonia patients and so a mixture of 3616 COVID-19, 6012\nnon-COVID lung opacity, and 8851 normal chest X-ray images were used to create\nthis dataset. Five different image enhancement techniques: histogram\nequalization, contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization, image\ncomplement, gamma correction, and Balance Contrast Enhancement Technique were\nused to improve COVID-19 detection accuracy. Six different Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) were investigated in this study. Gamma correction technique\noutperforms other enhancement techniques in detecting COVID-19 from standard\nand segmented lung CXR images. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, f1-score,\nand specificity in the detection of COVID-19 with gamma correction on CXR\nimages were 96.29%, 96.28%, 96.29%, 96.28% and 96.27% respectively.

Chest radiograph (CXR) has been playing a crucial role in\nCOVID-19 patient triaging, diagnosing and monitoring, particularly in the\nUnited States. Considering the mixed and unspecific signals in CXR, an image\nretrieval model of CXR that provides both similar images and associated\nclinical information can be more clinically meaningful than a direct image\ndiagnostic model. In this work we develop a novel CXR image retrieval model\nbased on deep metric learning. Unlike traditional diagnostic models which aims\nat learning the direct mapping from images to labels, the proposed model aims\nat learning the optimized embedding space of images, where images with the same\nlabels and similar contents are pulled together. It utilizes multi-similarity\nloss with hard-mining sampling strategy and attention mechanism to learn the\noptimized embedding space, and provides similar images to the query image. The\nmodel is trained and validated on an international multi-site COVID-19 dataset\ncollected from 3 different sources. Experimental results of COVID-19 image\nretrieval and diagnosis tasks show that the proposed model can serve as a\nrobust solution for CXR analysis and patient management for COVID-19. The model\nis also tested on its transferability on a different clinical decision support\ntask, where the pre-trained model is applied to extract image features from a\nnew dataset without any further training. These results demonstrate our deep\nmetric learning based image retrieval model is highly efficient in the CXR\nretrieval, diagnosis and prognosis, and thus has great clinical value for the\ntreatment and management of COVID-19 patients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 03:16:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

To validate our counter-claims, we evaluate the\nperformance of state-of-the-art methods on the dataset in [2] reaching about\n50% classification accuracy over 40 classes, lower than in [2], but still\nsignificant. We then investigate the influence of EEG temporal correlation on\nclassification accuracy by testing the same models in two additional\nexperimental settings: one that replicates [1]'s rapid-design experiment, and\nanother one that examines the data between blocks while subjects are shown a\nblank screen. In both cases, classification accuracy is at or near chance, in\ncontrast to what [1] reports, indicating a negligible contribution of temporal\ncorrelation to classification accuracy. We, instead, are able to replicate the\nresults in [1] only when intentionally contaminating our data by inducing a\ntemporal correlation. This suggests that what Li et al. [1] demonstrate is that\ntheir data are strongly contaminated by temporal correlation and low\nsignal-to-noise ratio. We argue that the reason why Li et al.
