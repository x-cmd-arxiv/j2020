We introduce a multivariate generalised linear mixed\nmodel for simultaneously describing the scatter and the intensity using data\nobtained with minirhizotrons (i.e., tubes with observation windows, which are\ninserted in the soil, enabling to observe the roots directly). The models\npresented allow studying intricate spatial and temporal dependence patterns\nusing a graphical model to represent the dependence structure of latent random\ncomponents.\n  The scatter is described by a binomial mixed model (presence of roots in\nobservation windows). The number of roots crossing the reference lines in the\nobservational windows of the minirhizotron is used to estimate the intensity\nthrough a specially defined Poisson mixed model. We explore the fact that it is\npossible to construct multivariate extensions of generalised linear mixed\nmodels that allow to simultaneously represent patterns of dependency of the\nscatter and the intensity along with time and space.\n  We present an example where the intensity and scatter are simultaneously\ndetermined at three different time points. A positive association between the\nintensity and scatter at each time point was found, suggesting that the plants\nare not compensating a reduced occupation of the soil by increasing the number\nof roots per volume of soil. Using the general properties of graphical models,\nwe identify a first-order Markovian dependence pattern between successively\nobserved scatters and intensities.

Each\ncombination creates a unique beam-weighted foreground. By generating\neigenvectors to fit each foreground model using Singular Value Decomposition\n(SVD), we examine the effects of varying the components of the beam-weighted\nforeground. We find that the eigenvectors for modelling an achromatic,\nisotropic beam -- the ideal case -- are nearly identical regardless of the\nunweighted foreground model used, and are practicably indistinguishable from\npolynomial-based models. When anisotropic, chromatic beams weight the\nforeground, however, a coupling is introduced between the spatial and spectral\nstructure of the foreground which distorts the eigenvectors away from the\npolynomial models and induces a dependence of the basis upon the exact features\nof the beam (chromaticity, pattern, pointing) and foreground (spectral index,\nsky brightness temperature map). We find that the beam has a greater impact\nupon the eigenvectors than foreground models.

Scene flow estimation is the task of estimating 3D flow vectors for\nconsecutive 3D point clouds. Such flow vectors are fruitful, \\eg for\nrecognizing actions, or avoiding collisions. Training a neural network via\nsupervised learning for scene flow is impractical, as this requires manual\nannotations for each 3D point at each new timestamp for each scene. To that\nend, we seek for a self-supervised approach, where a network learns a latent\nmetric to distinguish between points translated by flow estimations and the\ntarget point cloud. Our adversarial metric learning includes a multi-scale\ntriplet loss on sequences of two-point clouds as well as a cycle consistency\nloss. Furthermore, we outline a benchmark for self-supervised scene flow\nestimation: the Scene Flow Sandbox.

Phys. 16, 1064-1068 (2020)]. Here we report\nboth sound velocity and attenuation in LSCO $p=0.12$, i.e. at a doping level\nfor which the spin freezing temperature is the highest. Using high magnetic\nfields and comparing with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, we\nconfirm that the anomalies in the low temperature ultrasound properties of LSCO\nare produced by a coupling between the lattice and the spin glass. Moreover, we\nshow that both sound velocity and attenuation can be simultaneously accounted\nfor by a simple phenomenological model originally developed for canonical spin\nglasses. Our results point towards a strong competition between\nsuperconductivity and spin freezing, tuned by the magnetic field. A comparison\nof different acoustic modes suggests that the slow spin fluctuations have a\nnematic character.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2020 17:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

Recent works have shown that these 3D recognition networks are\nalso vulnerable to adversarial samples produced from various attack methods,\nincluding optimization-based 3D Carlini-Wagner attack, gradient-based iterative\nfast gradient method, and skeleton-detach based point-dropping. However, after\na careful analysis, these methods are either extremely slow because of the\noptimization/iterative scheme, or not flexible to support targeted attack of a\nspecific category. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel\nlabel guided adversarial network (LG-GAN) for real-time flexible targeted point\ncloud attack. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generation based\n3D point cloud attack method. By feeding the original point clouds and target\nattack label into LG-GAN, it can learn how to deform the point clouds to\nmislead the recognition network into the specific label only with a single\nforward pass. In detail, LGGAN first leverages one multi-branch adversarial\nnetwork to extract hierarchical features of the input point clouds, then\nincorporates the specified label information into multiple intermediate\nfeatures using the label encoder. Finally, the encoded features will be fed\ninto the coordinate reconstruction decoder to generate the target adversarial\nsample. By evaluating different point-cloud recognition models (e.g., PointNet,\nPointNet++ and DGCNN), we demonstrate that the proposed LG-GAN can support\nflexible targeted attack on the fly while guaranteeing good attack performance\nand higher efficiency simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2020 17:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

The dominant explanation for this phenomenon has long been the\nproposition that spatial averaging over a heterogeneous distribution of locally\nexponential relaxation processes leads to stretching. Here we perform\nsimulations of model polymeric and small-molecule glass-formers in the\nisoconfigurational ensemble to show that stretching instead emerges from a\ncombination of spatial averaging and locally nonexponential relaxation. Results\nindicate that localities in the fluid exhibiting faster-than-average relaxation\ntend to exhibit locally stretched relaxation, whereas slower-than-average\nrelaxing domains exhibit compressed exponential relaxation. We show that local\nstretching is predicted by loose local caging, as measured by the Debye-Waller\nfactor, and vice versa. This phenomenology in the local relaxation of\nin-equilibrium glasses parallels the dynamics of out of equilibrium under-dense\nand over-dense glasses, which likewise exhibit an asymmetry in their degree of\nstretching vs compression. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that\nlocal stretching and compression in equilibrium glass-forming liquids results\nfrom evolution of particle mobilities over a single local relaxation time, with\nslower particles tending towards acceleration and vice versa. In addition to\nproviding new insight into the origins of stretched relaxation, these results\nhave implications for the interpretation of stretching exponents as measured\nvia metrologies such as dielectric spectroscopy: measured stretching exponents\ncannot universally be interpreted as a direct measure of the breadth of an\nunderlying distribution of relaxation times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2020 18:06:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

This severely restricts their deployment on\nresource-limited devices. To address this issue, many efforts have been made on\ntraining low-bit weight DNNs. In this paper, we focus on training ternary\nweight \\{-1, 0, +1\\} networks which can avoid multiplications and dramatically\nreduce the memory and computation requirements. A ternary weight network can be\nconsidered as a sparser version of the binary weight counterpart by replacing\nsome -1s or 1s in the binary weights with 0s, thus leading to more efficient\ninference but more memory cost. However, the existing approaches to training\nternary weight networks cannot control the sparsity (i.e., percentage of 0s) of\nthe ternary weights, which undermines the advantage of ternary weights. In this\npaper, we propose to our best knowledge the first sparsity-control approach\n(SCA) to training ternary weight networks, which is simply achieved by a weight\ndiscretization regularizer (WDR). SCA is different from all the existing\nregularizer-based approaches in that it can control the sparsity of the ternary\nweights through a controller $\\alpha$ and does not rely on gradient estimators.\nWe theoretically and empirically show that the sparsity of the trained ternary\nweights is positively related to $\\alpha$. SCA is extremely simple,\neasy-to-implement, and is shown to consistently outperform the state-of-the-art\napproaches significantly over several benchmark datasets and even matches the\nperformances of the full-precision weight counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2020 18:06:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 01:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

Recently the lower bound $3^{n-1}\\log (2 \\rho-1)$ for the number of\ncalls to the comparison oracle needed to find the minimum of the discrete\nconvic function defined on integer points of some $n$-dimensional ball with\nradius $\\rho$ was obtained. But the problem of the existence of a polynomial\n(in $\\log\\rho$ for fixed $n$) algorithm for minimizing such functions has\nremained open. In this paper, we answer positively the question of the\nexistence of such an algorithm. Namely, we propose an algorithm for minimizing\ndiscrete convic functions that uses $2^{O(n^2 \\log n)} \\log \\rho$ calls to the\ncomparison oracle and has $2^{O(n^2 \\log n)} \\mbox{poly }(\\log \\rho)$ bit\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2020 18:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

In this paper we address\nfairness issues of ML models based on decision outcomes, and we show how the\nsimple idea of \"feature dropout\" followed by an \"ensemble approach\" can improve\nmodel fairness. To illustrate, we will revisit the case of \"LimeOut\" that was\nproposed to tackle \"process fairness\", which measures a model's reliance on\nsensitive or discriminatory features. Given a classifier, a dataset and a set\nof sensitive features, LimeOut first assesses whether the classifier is fair by\nchecking its reliance on sensitive features using \"Lime explanations\".

In this work we show that a filamentation instability, between an\ninitially unmagnetized ambient electron-proton plasma at rest and a beam of\npair plasma that moves through it at a non-relativistic speed, indeed results\nin preferential positron acceleration. Filaments form that are filled\npredominantly with particles with the same direction of their electric current\nvector.

Positron filaments can neutralize their net\ncharge by collecting the electrons of the ambient plasma while protons cannot\neasily follow the beam electron filaments. Positron filaments can thus be\ncompressed to a higher density and temperature than the beam electron\nfilaments. Filament mergers, which take place after the exponential growth\nphase of the instability has ended, lead to an expansion of the beam electron\nfilaments, which amplifies the magnetic field they generate and induces an\nelectric field in this filament. Beam electrons lose a substantial fraction of\ntheir kinetic energy to the electric field.

Given\npoints x and y in different metric measure spaces or in the same space, how\nsimilar are they? A well known approach is to consider x and y similar if their\nneighborhoods are similar. For metric measure spaces, similarity between\nneighborhoods is well captured by the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov distance, but\nit is NP-hard to compute this distance even in quite simple cases. We propose a\ntractable alternative: the radial distribution distance between the\nneighborhoods of x and y.

The advent of interactions between light and free\nquantum matter waves brought about fundamental questions regarding the role of\nthe particle wavefunction. Here we show that even in seemingly classical\nexperimental regimes, light emission is fundamentally tied to quantum\nproperties of the emitting particles, such as their quantum coherence and\ncorrelations. By employing quantum electrodynamics, we unveil the role of the\nparticle's coherent momentum uncertainty, without which decoherence of light\nbecomes dominant.

This quantum optical paradigm opens new capabilities in\nanalytical electron microscopy, enabling the measurement of quantum\ncorrelations of shaped electron wavepackets. Our findings also have\napplications for Cherenkov detectors in particle physics.

A typical setting\nis a causally sufficient setting, i.e. a system with no latent confounders,\nselection bias, or feedback, when the essential graph of the observational\nequivalence class (EC) is given as an input and interventions are assumed to be\nnoiseless. Most existing works focus on worst-case or average-case lower bounds\nfor the number of interventions required to orient a DAG. These worst-case\nlower bounds only establish that the largest clique in the essential graph\ncould make it difficult to learn the true DAG. In this work, we develop a\nuniversal lower bound for single-node interventions that establishes that the\nlargest clique is always a fundamental impediment to structure learning.\nSpecifically, we present a decomposition of a DAG into independently orientable\ncomponents through directed clique trees and use it to prove that the number of\nsingle-node interventions necessary to orient any DAG in an EC is at least the\nsum of half the size of the largest cliques in each chain component of the\nessential graph.

To solve this issue, we propose a single-stage multi-view fusion\nframework that takes LiDAR bird's-eye view, LiDAR range view and camera view\nimages as inputs for 3D object detection. To effectively fuse multi-view\nfeatures, we propose an attentive pointwise fusion (APF) module to estimate the\nimportance of the three sources with attention mechanisms that can achieve\nadaptive fusion of multi-view features in a pointwise manner. Furthermore, an\nattentive pointwise weighting (APW) module is designed to help the network\nlearn structure information and point feature importance with two extra tasks,\nnamely, foreground classification and center regression, and the predicted\nforeground probability is used to reweight the point features.

We show that after several reconnections\nthat produce ejections of smaller loops, the loop that remains bound to the\nblack hole moves on a nearly-periodic non-self-intersecting trajectory, \"the\norbit\". The orbit evolves due to an energy and angular momentum exchange\nbetween the loop and the spinning black hole. We show that such evolution is\nmathematically equivalent to a certain continuous deformation of an auxiliary\nclosed curve in a 3-dimensional space; for zero black-hole spin this\ndeformation is curve-shortening that has been extensively studied by\nmathematicians. The evolution features competing effects of loop growth by the\nsuperradiant extraction of the black-hole spin energy, and loop decay by the\nfriction of the moving string against the horizon. A self-intersection of an\nauxiliary curve corresponds to a capture by the black hole of a new string\nsegment and thus an addition of a new captured loop. Possible asymptotic states\nof such evolution are shown to be strong emitters of gravitational waves.\nWhether reconnections prevent reaching the asymptotic states remains to be\nexplored. Additionally, the orbit's shape also evolves due to an emission of\ngravitational waves, and a recoil of the black hole that changes the orbit and\nlikely leads to self-intersections.\n  We argue that for a significant range of the dimensionless tension $\\mu$,\nstring loops are captured by supermassive black holes at the centers of\ngalaxies. This strongly motivates further study of interaction between string\nloops and black holes, especially the influence of this process on the black\nhole spindown and on the production of gravitational waves by strings created\nin galactic nuclei.

Harnessing the wide applicability of the theorem, we show that a\ndemonstration of QEC by short random quantum circuits is feasible and that QEC\nis intrinsic in quantum chaotic systems.

One way to address this\nchallenge is to augment existing strong neural VQA models with the mechanisms\nthat allow them to retain information from previous dialog turns. One strong\nVQA model is the MAC network, which decomposes a task into a series of\nattention-based reasoning steps. However, since the MAC network is designed for\nsingle-turn question answering, it is not capable of referring to past dialog\nturns. More specifically, it struggles with tasks that require reasoning over\nthe dialog history, particularly coreference resolution. We extend the MAC\nnetwork architecture with Context-aware Attention and Memory (CAM), which\nattends over control states in past dialog turns to determine the necessary\nreasoning operations for the current question. MAC nets with CAM achieve up to\n98.25% accuracy on the CLEVR-Dialog dataset, beating the existing\nstate-of-the-art by 30% (absolute). Our error analysis indicates that with CAM,\nthe model's performance particularly improved on questions that required\ncoreference resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 01:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

With the prevalence of wind energy, it\nbecomes possible to consider the wind curtailment as a dispatch variable in\nCCO. However, the wind curtailment will cause impulse for the uncertainty\ndistribution, yielding challenges for the chance constraints modeling. To deal\nwith that, a data-driven framework is developed. By modeling the wind\ncurtailment as a cap enforced on the wind power output, the proposed framework\nconstructs a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate to describe the relationship\nbetween wind curtailment and the chance constraints. This allows us to\nreformulate the CCO with wind curtailment as a mixed-integer second-order cone\nprogramming (MI-SOCP) problem. An error correction strategy is developed by\nsolving a convex linear programming (LP) to improve the modeling accuracy. Case\nstudies performed on the PJM 5-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems demonstrate that\nthe proposed method is capable of accurately accounting the influence of wind\ncurtailment dispatch in CCO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 02:25:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

To expand the choice of products and delivery methods, new\nmedications and delivery methods are under development. Future trials of\nnon-inferiority, given the high efficacy of ARV-based PrEP products as they\nbecome current or future standard of care, would require a large number of\nparticipants and long follow-up time that may not be feasible. This motivates\nthe construction of a counterfactual estimate that approximates incidence for a\nrandomized concurrent control group receiving no PrEP.

Two resolution strategies are UR (Unit Resulting)\nresolution and hyper-resolution. In experiment, we come two kinds of automated\ncircuit construction: 3 input/output inverters and 4 input/output BCD Counter\nCircuit. Both circuits are constructed with a few limited inverters. Curiously,\nit has been turned out that UR resolution is drastically faster than\nhyper-resolution in the measurement of the size of SOS (Set of Support).\nBesides, we discuss the syntactic and semantic criteria which might causes\nconsiderable difference of computation cost between UR resolution and\nhyper-resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 06:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

Specifically, the CaCL algorithm is deployed to segment protein\nexpressed brush border regions from histological images of human duodenum. Our\ncontribution is three-fold: (1) we approach the weakly supervised segmentation\nfrom a novel codebook learning perspective; (2) the CaCL algorithm segments\ndiffuse image patterns rather than focal objects; and (3) the proposed\nalgorithm is implemented in a multi-task framework based on Vector\nQuantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) via joint image reconstruction,\nclassification, feature embedding, and segmentation.

The main difficulty\nis to generate model-based control methods that account for deformation\ndynamics during tissue manipulation. Previous works in vision-based perception\ncan capture the geometric changes within the scene, however, model-based\ncontrollers integrated with dynamic properties, a more accurate and safe\napproach, has not been studied before. Considering the mechanic coupling\nbetween the robot and the environment, it is crucial to develop a registered,\nsimulated dynamical model. In this work, we propose an online, continuous,\nreal-to-sim registration method to bridge 3D visual perception with\nposition-based dynamics (PBD) modeling of tissues. The PBD method is employed\nto simulate soft tissue dynamics as well as rigid tool interactions for\nmodel-based control. Meanwhile, a vision-based strategy is used to generate 3D\nreconstructed point cloud surfaces based on real-world manipulation, so as to\nregister and update the simulation. To verify this real-to-sim approach, tissue\nexperiments have been conducted on the da Vinci Research Kit. Our real-to-sim\napproach successfully reduces registration error online, which is especially\nimportant for safety during autonomous control.

Two classes of Mpemba\neffect are identified, the normal and the anomalous one. The former is generic,\nin the sense that the kinetic temperature starting from a cold nonequilibrium\nsheared state is overtaken by the one starting from a hot quasi-equilibrium\nstate, due to the absence of initial viscous heating in the latter, resulting\nin a faster initial cooling. The anomalous Mpemba effect is opposite to the\nnormal one since, despite the initial slower cooling of the nonequilibrium\nsheared state, it can eventually overtake an initially colder quasi-equilibrium\nstate.

Due to atmospheric conditions and hardware\nmalfunction, outdoor mmWave antenna arrays are prone to blockages or complete\nfailures. This results in a modified array geometry, distorted far-field\nradiation pattern, and system performance degradation. Recent remote array\ndiagnostic techniques have emerged as an effective way to detect defective\nantenna elements in an array with few diagnostic measurements. These\ntechniques, however, require full and perfect channel state information (CSI),\nwhich can be challenging to acquire in the presence of antenna faults. This\npaper proposes a new remote array diagnosis technique that relaxes the need for\nfull CSI and only requires knowledge of the incident angle-of-arrivals, i.e.\npartial channel knowledge. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed technique and show that fault detection can be obtained with\ncomparable number of diagnostic measurements required by diagnostic techniques\nbased on full channel knowledge. In presence of channel estimation errors, the\nproposed technique is shown to out-perform recently proposed array diagnostic\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 08:54:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

However the AIS scale cannot currently be\ncomputed by using finite element human computer models, which calculate a\nmaximum principal strains (MPS). Further, MPS only establishes a threshold\nabove which a serious or fatal injury occurs. In order to overcome these\nlimitations, a unique Organ Trauma Model (OTM) able to calculate the threat to\nlife of any organ injury is proposed. The focus, in this case is on real world\npedestrian brain injuries. The OTM uses a power method, named Peak Virtual\nPower (PVP), and defines brain white and grey matters trauma responses as a\nfunction of impact location and impact speed extracted from the pedestrian\ncollision kinematics. This research has included ageing in the injury severity\ncomputation by including soft tissue material degradation, as well as brain\nvolume changes. Further, to account for the limitations of the Lagrangian\nformulation of the brain model in representing haemorrhage, an approach to\ninclude the effects of subdural hematoma is proposed and included as part of\nthe OTM predictions in this study. The OTM model was tested against three\nreal-life pedestrian accidents and has proven to reasonably predict the Post\nMortem (PM) outcome. Its AIS predictions are closer to the real world injury\nseverity than standard MPS methods currently recommended. This study suggests\nthat the OTM has the potential to improve forensic predictions as well as\ncontribute to the improvement in vehicle safety design through the ability to\nmeasure injury severity. This study concludes that future advances in trauma\ncomputing would require the development of a brain model which could predict\nhaemorrhaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 08:54:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

The data\ncoming from various sensors are often correlated due to the underlying\nrelations in the system parameters that the sensors monitor. In theory, it\nshould be possible to emulate the output of certain sensors based on other\nsensors. Tapping into such possibilities holds tremendous advantages in terms\nof reducing system design complexity. In order to identify the subset of\nsensors whose readings can be emulated, the sensors must be grouped into\nclusters.

While\nstate-of-the-art 2D generative models like GANs show unprecedented quality in\nmodeling the natural image manifold, it is unclear whether they implicitly\ncapture the underlying 3D object structures. And if so, how could we exploit\nsuch knowledge to recover the 3D shapes of objects in the images? To answer\nthese questions, in this work, we present the first attempt to directly mine 3D\ngeometric cues from an off-the-shelf 2D GAN that is trained on RGB images only.\nThrough our investigation, we found that such a pre-trained GAN indeed contains\nrich 3D knowledge and thus can be used to recover 3D shape from a single 2D\nimage in an unsupervised manner. The core of our framework is an iterative\nstrategy that explores and exploits diverse viewpoint and lighting variations\nin the GAN image manifold. The framework does not require 2D keypoint or 3D\nannotations, or strong assumptions on object shapes (e.g. shapes are\nsymmetric), yet it successfully recovers 3D shapes with high precision for\nhuman faces, cats, cars, and buildings. The recovered 3D shapes immediately\nallow high-quality image editing like relighting and object rotation.

Recently, federated learning systems that use edge\ndevices as clients to support local human activity recognition have emerged as\na new paradigm to combine local (individual-level) and global (group-level)\nmodels. This approach provides better scalability and generalisability and also\noffers better privacy compared with the traditional centralised analysis and\nlearning models. The assumption behind federated learning, however, relies on\nsupervised learning on clients. This requires a large volume of labelled data,\nwhich is difficult to collect in uncontrolled IoT environments such as remote\nin-home monitoring.\n  In this paper, we propose an activity recognition system that uses\nsemi-supervised federated learning, wherein clients conduct unsupervised\nlearning on autoencoders with unlabelled local data to learn general\nrepresentations, and a cloud server conducts supervised learning on an activity\nclassifier with labelled data. Our experimental results show that using a long\nshort-term memory autoencoder and a Softmax classifier, the accuracy of our\nproposed system is higher than that of both centralised systems and\nsemi-supervised federated learning using data augmentation.

Subcritical solutions are then found by tracking\nthis solution branch into the subcritical regime, taking a supercritical\nsolution and then gradually lowering the corresponding Rayleigh number. We show\nthat decreasing the Ekman number leads to an extension of the subcritical range\nof Ra/Ra$_c$, down to an optimal value of Ek$=10^{-5}$.

Being increasingly used as a stand-alone\napplication, IPFS has also emerged as the technical backbone of various other\ndecentralised solutions and was even used to evade censorship. Decentralised\napplications serving millions of users rely on IPFS as one of their crucial\nbuilding blocks. This popularity makes IPFS attractive for large-scale attacks.\nWe have identified a conceptual issue in one of IPFS's core libraries and\ndemonstrate their exploitation by means of a successful end-to-end attack.

The\nSO crossed susceptibility is defined as the response function of their spin\npolarization to the \"orbital\" magnetic field, namely the effect of magnetic\nfield on the orbital motion of particles as the vector potential. Once\nrelativistic and nonrelativistic fermions are hybridized, their SO crossed\nsusceptibility gets modified at the Fermi energy around the band hybridization\npoint, leading to spin polarization of nonrelativistic fermions as well. These\neffects are enhanced under a dynamical magnetic field that violates thermal\nequilibrium, arising from the interband process permitted by the band\nhybridization. Its experimental realization is discussed for Dirac electrons in\nsolids with slight breaking of crystalline symmetry or doping, and also for\nquark matter including dilute heavy quarks strongly hybridized with light\nquarks, arising in a relativistic heavy-ion collision process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 10:45:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 10:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

In the MISO BCCM, a $K$-antenna transmitter (TX)\ncommunicates toward $K$ single-antenna receivers (RXs), so that message for RX\n$k$ is kept secret from RX $j$ with $j<k$. For this model, we consider the\nscenario in which the CSI of the RXs from $2$ to $K$ is instantaneously known\nat the transmitter while CSI of RX $1$ is known at the transmitter (i)\ninstantaneously for half of the time and (ii) with a unit delay for the\nremainder of the time.

In\nparticular, for the first time we pretrain neural networks via emergent\ncommunication from referential games. Our key assumption is that grounding\ncommunication on images---as a crude approximation of real-world\nenvironments---inductively biases the model towards learning natural languages.\nOn the one hand, we show that this substantially benefits machine translation\nin few-shot settings. On the other hand, this also provides an extrinsic\nevaluation protocol to probe the properties of emergent languages ex vitro.\nIntuitively, the closer they are to natural languages, the higher the gains\nfrom pretraining on them should be.

Currently only the differences of the\nmasses' squares are known, and an upper bound on the sum. However, upcoming\nsurveys of the Universe's large-scale structure (LSS) can probe the neutrino\nmass by exposing how neutrinos modulate galaxy clustering. But these\nmeasurements are challenging: in looking at the clustering of galaxy pairs, the\neffect of neutrinos is degenerate with galaxy formation, the details of which\nare unknown. Marginalizing over them degrades the constraints. Here we show\nthat using correlations of galaxy triplets---the 3-Point Correlation Function\nor its Fourier-space analog the bispectrum---can break the degeneracy between\ngalaxy formation physics (known as biasing) and the neutrino mass.\nSpecifically, we find a signature of neutrinos in the bispectrum's dipole\nmoment (with respect to triangle opening angle) that is roughly orthogonal to\nthe contribution of galaxy biases. This signature was missed in previous works\nby failing to account for how neutrinos alter mode-coupling between\nperturbations on different scales. Our proposed signature will contribute to\nupcoming LSS surveys' such as DESI making a robust detection of the neutrino\nmass.

Collisional heating by\ngas with properties derived from X-ray observations produces dust temperatures\ntoo high to fit the far-IR fluxes from each SNR. An additional colder dust\ncomponent is required, which has a minimum mass several orders of magnitude\nlarger than that of the warm dust heated by the X-ray emitting gas. Dust-to-gas\nmass ratios indicate that the majority of the dust in the X-ray emitting\nmaterial has been destroyed, while the fraction of surviving dust in the cold\ncomponent is plausibly close to unity. As the cold component makes up virtually\nall the total dust mass, destruction timescales based on homogeneous models,\nwhich cannot account for multiple phases of shocked gas and dust, may be\nsignificantly overestimating actual dust destruction efficiencies, and\nsubsequently underestimating grain lifetimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 12:36:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

Being often trained on implicit user feedback, many\nrecommenders suffer from the sparsity challenge due to the lack of explicitly\nnegative samples. The GAN-style recommenders (i.e., IRGAN) addresses the\nchallenge by learning a generator and a discriminator adversarially, such that\nthe generator produces increasingly difficult samples for the discriminator to\naccelerate optimizing the discrimination objective. However, producing samples\nfrom the generator is very time-consuming, and our empirical study shows that\nthe discriminator performs poor in top-k item recommendation. To this end, a\ntheoretical analysis is made for the GAN-style algorithms, showing that the\ngenerator of limit capacity is diverged from the optimal generator. This may\ninterpret the limitation of discriminator's performance. Based on these\nfindings, we propose a Sampling-Decomposable Generative Adversarial Recommender\n(SD-GAR). In the framework, the divergence between some generator and the\noptimum is compensated by self-normalized importance sampling; the efficiency\nof sample generation is improved with a sampling-decomposable generator, such\nthat each sample can be generated in O(1) with the Vose-Alias method.\nInterestingly, due to decomposability of sampling, the generator can be\noptimized with the closed-form solutions in an alternating manner, being\ndifferent from policy gradient in the GAN-style algorithms. We extensively\nevaluate the proposed algorithm with five real-world recommendation datasets.\nThe results show that SD-GAR outperforms IRGAN by 12.4% and the SOTA\nrecommender by 10% on average.

In experiments it\nis seen that spherical paramagnetic particles rotate, which can be explained by\nsmall magnetic anisotropy. In this article, the maximal chain length is\ncalculated for paramagnetic particles with magnetic anisotropy in a rotating\nmagnetic field. Results show that the maximal chain length as a function of\nfield frequency has the same trend for isotropic magnetic particles and\nparticles with magnetic anisotropy if the field frequency is much higher or\nmuch lower than the critical frequency of an individual particle. blue\nInitially randomly distributed particles will form chains that will collide and\nexchange with particles till they obtain a typical chain length.

Besides, due\nto the diversity and dynamic of quality of service (QoS) in the cloud\nenvironment, the existing trust assessment methods based on the single constant\nvalue of QoS attribute and the subjective weight assignment are not good enough\nto provide an effective solution for PCCs to identify and select a trustworthy\ncloud service among a wide range of functionally-equivalent cloud service\nproviders (CSPs).

In order to accurately and efficiently assess\nthe trust level of cloud services, a QoS-based trust assessment model is\nproposed.

Given the technical limitations of\nimaging and probing, the in situ visualization of these waves inside cardiac\ntissue remains a challenge. Therefore, we must, perforce, rely on in-silico\nsimulations of scroll waves in mathematical models for cardiac tissue to\ndevelop an understanding of the dynamics of these waves in mammalian hearts. We\nuse direct numerical simulations of the Hund-Rudy-Dynamic (HRD) model, for\ncanine ventricular tissue, to examine the interplay between electrical\nscroll-waves and conduction and ionic inhomogeneities, in anatomically\nrealistic canine ventricular geometries with muscle-fiber architecture.

We show that ionic inhomogeneities, both distributed or\nlocalised, suppress scroll-wave break up. The dynamics of a stable rotating\nwave is not affected significantly by such inhomogeneities, except at high\nconcentrations of distributed inhomogeneities, which can cause a partial break\nup of scroll waves.

However, the sentence embeddings from the\npre-trained language models without fine-tuning have been found to poorly\ncapture semantic meaning of sentences. In this paper, we argue that the\nsemantic information in the BERT embeddings is not fully exploited. We first\nreveal the theoretical connection between the masked language model\npre-training objective and the semantic similarity task theoretically, and then\nanalyze the BERT sentence embeddings empirically. We find that BERT always\ninduces a non-smooth anisotropic semantic space of sentences, which harms its\nperformance of semantic similarity. To address this issue, we propose to\ntransform the anisotropic sentence embedding distribution to a smooth and\nisotropic Gaussian distribution through normalizing flows that are learned with\nan unsupervised objective. Experimental results show that our proposed\nBERT-flow method obtains significant performance gains over the\nstate-of-the-art sentence embeddings on a variety of semantic textual\nsimilarity tasks.

Motion vectors have shown to be beneficial for\ndownstream tasks such as action classification and collision avoidance.\nHowever, data collected via LiDAR sensors and stereo cameras are computation\nand labor intensive to precisely annotate for scene flow. We address this\nannotation bottleneck on two ends. We propose a 3D scene flow benchmark and a\nnovel self-supervised setup for training flow models. The benchmark consists of\ndatasets designed to study individual aspects of flow estimation in progressive\norder of complexity, from a single object in motion to real-world scenes.\nFurthermore, we introduce Adversarial Metric Learning for self-supervised flow\nestimation. The flow model is fed with sequences of point clouds to perform\nflow estimation. A second model learns a latent metric to distinguish between\nthe points translated by the flow estimations and the target point cloud. This\nlatent metric is learned via a Multi-Scale Triplet loss, which uses\nintermediary feature vectors for the loss calculation. We use our proposed\nbenchmark to draw insights about the performance of the baselines and of\ndifferent models when trained using our setup. We find that our setup is able\nto keep motion coherence and preserve local geometries, which many\nself-supervised baselines fail to grasp. Dealing with occlusions, on the other\nhand, is still an open challenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2020 17:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

Often,\nthese definitions compete with each other and it is unclear which definition\nshould be used in which context. A prominent example is the definition of\ncyclones in climate research. Despite the differences, frequently these feature\ndefinitions can be related to topological concepts.\n  In our approach, we provide a cyclone tracking framework that supports\ninteractive feature definition and comparison based on a precomputed tracking\ngraph that stores all extremal points as well as their temporal correspondents.\nThe framework combines a set of independent building blocks: critical point\nextraction, critical point tracking, feature definition, and track exploration.\nOne of the major advantages of such an approach is the flexibility it provides,\nthat is, each block is exchangeable. Moreover, it also enables us to perform\nthe most expensive analysis, the construction of a full tracking graph, as a\nprepossessing step, while keeping the feature definition interactive. Different\nfeature definitions can be explored and compared interactively based on this\ntracking graph. Features are specified by rules for grouping critical points,\nwhile feature tracking corresponds to filtering and querying the full tracking\ngraph by specific requests. We demonstrate this method for cyclone\nidentification and tracking in the context of climate research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2020 17:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}
