In this work,\nwe propose a non-patch based modification to LoTeNet that performs one MPS\noperation per layer, instead of several patch-level operations. The spatial\ninformation in the input images to MPS blocks at each layer is squeezed into\nthe feature dimension, similar to LoTeNet, to maximise retained spatial\ncorrelation between pixels when images are flattened into 1D vectors. The\nproposed multi-layered tensor network (MLTN) is capable of learning linear\ndecision boundaries in high dimensional spaces in a multi-layered setting,\nwhich results in a reduction in the computation cost compared to LoTeNet\nwithout any degradation in performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 16:01:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 11:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-22"}

The BBH merger event rate is\nestimated based on a set of 65 state-of-the-art evolutionary models of star\nclusters, as presented in Banerjee (2021). These relativistic direct many-body\ncomputed models incorporate up-to-date stellar mass loss and remnant formation\ningredients. The merger-event rates are obtained by constructing a cluster\npopulation of the Universe, out of the models, taking into account mass\ndistribution of clusters and cosmic star formation and enrichment histories, as\nper observations. The model BBH merger rate density ranges from a pessimistic\nto a reference value of $0.5{\\rm~yr}^{-1}{\\rm Gpc}^{-3}-37.9{\\rm~yr}^{-1}{\\rm\nGpc}^{-3}$, for a LIGO-Virgo-like detector horizon. The reference rate well\naccommodates the BBH merger rate densities estimated from GWTC-1 and GWTC-2\nmerger-event catalogues. The computed models also yield differential BBH merger\nrate densities that agree reasonably with those from GWTC-1 and, as well, with\nthe much more constrained ones from GWTC-2. These results suggest that\ndynamical interactions in YMCs and OCs can, in principle, alone explain the BBH\nmerger rate density and its dependence on the merging-binary properties, as\ninferred from to-date gravitational-wave (GW) events. The cosmic evolution of\nmerger rate density from the computed models is also studied. The models\npredict a rate of $\\approx5{\\rm~yr}^{-1}{\\rm Gpc}^{-3}$ for eccentric\nLIGO-Virgo mergers from YMCs and OCs. The improving constraints on BBH merger\nrate density with mounting GW events will help constraining scenarios of star\ncluster formation across cosmic time and as well the relative contributions of\nthe various compact binary merger channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 16:31:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 15:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

The underlying multipolar topology, pre-eruption activities, and\nsequence of magnetic reconnection onsets (first breakout, then flare) of many\nobserved fast CMEs/eruptive flares are fully consistent with the model.\nRecently, we have demonstrated that most observed coronal-hole jets in\nfan/spine topologies also are induced by breakout reconnection at the null\npoint above a filament channel (with or without a filament). For these two\ntypes of eruptions occurring in similar topologies, the key question is, why do\nsome events generate jets while others form CMEs? We focused on the initiation\nof eruptions in large bright points/small active regions that were located in\ncoronal holes and clearly exhibited null-point (fan/spine) topologies: such\nconfigurations are referred to as pseudostreamers. We analyzed and compared\nSDO/AIA, SOHO/LASCO, and RHESSI observations of three events.

They can grow by accreting\nmaterial to become full-size planets. Planetesimals themselves are thought to\nform by complex physical processes from small grains in protoplanetary disks.\nThe streaming instability (SI) model states that mm/cm-size particles (pebbles)\nare aerodynamically collected into self-gravitating clouds which then directly\ncollapse into planetesimals. Here we analyze ATHENA simulations of the SI to\ncharacterize the initial properties (e.g., rotation) of pebble clouds. Their\ngravitational collapse is followed with the PKDGRAV N-body code, which has been\nmodified to realistically account for pebble collisions. We find that pebble\nclouds rapidly collapse into short-lived disk structures from which\nplanetesimals form. The planetesimal properties depend on the cloud's scaled\nangular momentum, l=L/(M R_H^2 Omega, where L and M are the angular momentum\nand mass, R_H is the Hill radius, and Omega is the orbital frequency. Low-l\npebble clouds produce tight (or contact) binaries and single planetesimals.\nCompact high-l clouds give birth to binary planetesimals with attributes that\nclosely resemble the equal-size binaries found in the Kuiper belt.\nSignificantly, the SI-triggered gravitational collapse can explain the angular\nmomentum distribution of known equal-size binaries -- a result pending\nverification from studies with improved resolution. About 10% of collapse\nsimulations produce hierarchical systems with two or more large moons. These\nsystems should be found in the Kuiper belt when observations reach the\nthreshold sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 18:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-16"}

Most existing methods for synthesizing\ninferences rely on parametric model assumptions, such as normality, which often\ndo not hold in practice. In this paper, we propose a general nonparametric\nfusion learning framework for synthesizing inferences of the target parameter\nfrom multiple sources. The main tool underlying the proposed framework is the\nnotion of depth confidence distribution (depth-CD), which is also developed in\nthis paper. Broadly speaking, a depth-CD is a data-driven nonparametric summary\ndistribution of inferential information for the target parameter. We show that\na depth-CD is a useful inferential tool and, moreover, is an omnibus form of\nconfidence regions (or p-values), whose contours of level sets shrink toward\nthe true parameter value. The proposed fusion learning approach combines\ndepth-CDs from the individual studies, with each depth-CD constructed by\nnonparametric bootstrap and data depth. This approach is shown to be efficient,\ngeneral and robust. Specifically, it achieves high-order accuracy and Bahadur\nefficiency under suitably chosen combining elements. It allows the model or\ninference structure to be different among individual studies. And it readily\nadapts to heterogeneous studies with a broad range of complex and irregular\nsettings. This property enables it to utilize indirect evidence from incomplete\nstudies to gain efficiency in the overall inference. The advantages of the\nproposed approach are demonstrated simulations and in a Federal Aviation\nAdministration (FAA) study of aircraft landing performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 18:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-16"}

In this paper, we propose\nPTDNet, a parameterized topological denoising network, to improve the\nrobustness and generalization performance of GNNs by learning to drop\ntask-irrelevant edges. PTDNet prunes task-irrelevant edges by penalizing the\nnumber of edges in the sparsified graph with parameterized networks. To take\ninto consideration of the topology of the entire graph, the nuclear norm\nregularization is applied to impose the low-rank constraint on the resulting\nsparsified graph for better generalization. PTDNet can be used as a key\ncomponent in GNN models to improve their performances on various tasks, such as\nnode classification and link prediction. Experimental studies on both synthetic\nand benchmark datasets show that PTDNet can improve the performance of GNNs\nsignificantly and the performance gain becomes larger for more noisy datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 18:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-16"}

The reachability problem asks for\nthe existence of an assignment of the parameters to the non-negative integers\nsuch that reachability holds in the underlying timed automaton. The\nreachability problem for PTA is long known to be undecidable, already over\nthree parametric clocks.\n  A few years ago, Bundala and Ouaknine proved that for PTA over two parametric\nclocks and one parameter the reachability problem is decidable and also showed\na lower bound for the complexity class PSPACE^NEXP. Our main result is that the\nreachability problem for two-parametric timed automata with one parameter is\nEXPSPACE-complete. Our contribution is two-fold.\n  For the EXPSPACE lower bound we make use of deep results from complexity\ntheory, namely a serializability characterization of EXPSPACE (based on\nBarrington's Theorem) and a logspace translation of numbers in chinese\nremainder representation to binary representation.\n  For the EXPSPACE upper bound, we give a careful exponential time reduction\nfrom PTA over two parametric clocks and one parameter to a slight subclass of\nparametric one-counter automata (POCA) over one parameter based on a minor\nadjustment of a construction due to Bundala and Ouaknine. We provide a series\nof techniques to partition a fictitious run of a POCA into several carefully\nchosen subruns that allow us to prove that it is sufficient to consider a\nparameter value of exponential magnitude only. This allows us to show a\ndoubly-exponential upper bound on the value of the only parameter of a PTA over\ntwo parametric clocks and one parameter. We hope that extensions of our\ntechniques lead to finally establishing decidability of the long-standing open\nproblem of reachability in parametric timed automata with two parametric clocks\n(and arbitrarily many parameters).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 19:10:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

Neither the construction of a\nkinetic triangulation nor the computation of a motorcycle graph is required.\nDue to its incremental nature, there is always a room in the algorithm for the\ninteractive construction of the straight skeleton. The proposed algorithm is of\npredictor-corrector type. In the algorithm, the edge collapse and edge split\nevents are tackled by a completely different novel original approach which is\nfirst of its kind. In the predictor step, the position of the vertices is\nadvanced in time by direct integration assuming no event. Then predicted\npositions are corrected by using linear interpolation if there are edge\ncollapse or edge split events within the same increment. In the algorithm edge\ncollapse and edge split events are detected by, respectively, edge swap and\nedge penetration. The proposed algorithm has been used to construct roof\ntopology starting from a floor plan of various complexity ranging from simple\nconvex to highly nonconvex with holes. In order to construct, improve and test\nthe building blocks of the underlying algorithm, a graphical user interface,\nStraight Skeleton Development Kit, has also been developed in parallel by the\nauthor using C++ programming language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 19:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

We use exact\ndiagonalization to study many electrons in short 1-D atom chains represented by\nlong-range extended Hubbard-like models. We introduce a novel measure, the\nSingle-Particle Excitation Content (SPEC) of an eigenstate and show that the\ndependence of SPEC on state number reveals the nature of the ground state, and\nthe onset and saturation of correlation between the electrons as Coulomb\ninteraction strength increases. We use this SPEC behavior to identify five\nregimes as interaction is increased: a non-interacting single-particle regime,\na regime of perturbative Coulomb interaction in which the SPEC is a nearly\nuniversal function of state number, the onset and saturation of correlation, a\nregime of fully correlated states in which hopping is a perturbation and SPEC\nis a different universal function of state number, and the regime of no\nhopping. In particular, the behavior of the SPEC shows that when\nelectron-electron correlation plays a minor role, all of the lowest energy\nstates are made up primarily of single-particle excitations of the ground\nstate, and as the Coulomb interaction increases, the lowest energy states\nincreasingly contain many-particle excitations. In addition, the SPEC\nhighlights a fundamental, distinct difference between a non-interacting system\nand one with minute, very weak interactions. While SPEC is a quantity that can\nbe calculated for small exactly diagonalizable systems, it guides our intuition\nfor larger systems, suggesting the nature of excitations and their distribution\nin the spectrum. Thus, this function, like correlation functions or order\nparameters, provides us with a window of intuition about the behavior of a\nphysical system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 20:22:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 22:23:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 20:17:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

This is due to the difficulty of\nobtaining accurate models of complex CPS for traditional control. However, to\nsecurely deploy DRL in production, it is essential to examine the weaknesses of\nDRL-based controllers (policies) towards malicious attacks from all angles. In\nthis work, we investigate targeted attacks in the action-space domain, also\ncommonly known as actuation attacks in CPS literature, which perturbs the\noutputs of a controller. We show that a query-based black-box attack model that\ngenerates optimal perturbations with respect to an adversarial goal can be\nformulated as another reinforcement learning problem. Thus, such an adversarial\npolicy can be trained using conventional DRL methods. Experimental results\nshowed that adversarial policies that only observe the nominal policy's output\ngenerate stronger attacks than adversarial policies that observe the nominal\npolicy's input and output. Further analysis reveals that nominal policies whose\noutputs are frequently at the boundaries of the action space are naturally more\nrobust towards adversarial policies. Lastly, we propose the use of adversarial\ntraining with transfer learning to induce robust behaviors into the nominal\npolicy, which decreases the rate of successful targeted attacks by 50%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 20:25:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 21:28:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

In low and middle income countries, where the burden of\nunder-five mortality is concentrated, vital registration is often lacking and\nhousehold surveys, which provide full birth history data, are often the most\nreliable source. Unfortunately, these data are spatially sparse and so data are\npulled from other sources to increase the available information. Summary birth\nhistories represent a large fraction of the available data, and provide numbers\nof births and deaths aggregated over time, along with the mother's age.\n  OBJECTIVE\n  Specialized methods are needed to leverage this information, and previously\nthe Brass method, and variants, have been used. We wish to develop a\nmodel-based approach that can propagate errors, and make the most efficient use\nof the data. Further, we strive to provide a method that does not have large\ncomputational overhead.\n  CONTRIBUTION\n  We describe a computationally efficient model-based approach which allows\nsummary birth history and full birth history data to be combined into analyses\nof under-five mortality in a natural way. The method is based on fertility and\nmortality models that allow direct smoothing over time and space, with the\npossibility for including relevant covariates that are associated with\nfertility and/or mortality.

In the literature, many so-called\nself-consistent GW methods are based on diagonal approximation of G and\nlow-ranking approximation of W. It is thus worth to check how good such\napproximations are in comparison with the full matrix method. In this work, we\nconsider AlAs, AlP, GaP, and ZnS as the prototype systems to perform sc-GW\ncalculations by expressing the full G matrix using a plane-wave basis set. We\ncompared our sc-GW results with the diagonal G and subspace W approximated\nsc-GW results (sc-GW-diagG and sc-GW-subW methods). In the sc-GW-diagG method,\ninteracting G is expanded in the eigenvectors of non-interacting G such that\nonly diagonal elements are retained, whereas, the number of eigenmodes is\ntruncated in sc-GW-subW calculations. A systematic analysis of the results\nobtained from the above techniques is presented. The differences in the\nquasiparticle bandgap between the approximated and the full matrix sc-GW\napproaches are mostly less than 1.7% that validates such widely adopted\napproximations, and also shows how such low-ranking approximation can be used\nto include higher-order terms like the vertex correction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 21:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

We have explored the free parameter space of the model,\ntaking into account various constraints on the muon $g-2$ using recent data\nfrom the E989 experiment at Fermilab, the lepton universality violation in\nterms of $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$, and the branching ratios of the semileptonic\ndecays, $B^+ \\rightarrow K^+ \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ and $B^0 \\rightarrow K^{*0} \\mu^+\n\\mu^-$, the LEP and LHC searches for sleptons and $Z'$ boson, as well as the\nperturbative requirement. The viable parameter regions of the model are\nidentified. In the presence of the gauge kinetic mixing term, those regions are\nenlarged and significantly deformed in comparison to the case with vanishing\nkinetic mixing. In the near future, the E989 experiment with the projected\nsensitivity will be able to test significant parts of the currently allowed\nparameter regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 01:08:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 10:43:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 15:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

This method allows a machine learning project to leverage the\npowerful fit of physics-informed augmentation for providing significant boost\nto predictive accuracy. Successfully verified by the prediction of rejection\nrate and flux of thin film polyamide nanofiltration membranes, with the\nrelative error dropping from 16.34% to 6.71% and the coefficient of\ndetermination rising from 0.16 to 0.75, the proposed deep spatial learning with\nmolecular vibration is widely instructive for molecular science. Experimental\ncomparison unequivocally demonstrates its superiority over common learning\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 02:46:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

This method, based on an Auto-regressive modeling combined with a\nMaximum Entropy Method, yields a dramatic improvement in both the\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio and the quality of the surface current estimation for\nvery short integration time.

Accurate and robust identification and tracking algorithms for\nthe dispersed phase are necessary to reliably measure this evolution and\nthereby quantify the underlying mechanisms in interface-resolving flow\nsimulations. The identification of individual bubbles and drops traditionally\nrelies on an algorithm used to identify connected regions. This traditional\nalgorithm can be sensitive to the presence of spurious structures. A\ncost-effective refinement is proposed to maximize volume accuracy while\nminimizing the identification of spurious bubbles and drops. An accurate\nidentification scheme is crucial for distinguishing bubble and drop pairs with\nlarge size ratios. The identified bubbles and drops need to be tracked in time\nto obtain breakup and coalescence statistics that characterize the evolution of\nthe size distribution, including breakup and coalescence frequencies, and the\nprobability distributions of parent and child bubble and drop sizes. An\nalgorithm based on mass conservation is proposed to construct bubble and drop\nlineages using simulation snapshots that are not necessarily from consecutive\ntime-steps.

LIS presents a new physical layer technology for improving\ncoverage and energy efficiency by intelligently controlling the propagation\nenvironment. In practice however, achieving the anticipated gains of LIS\nrequires accurate channel estimation. Recent attempts to solve this problem\nhave considered the least-squares (LS) approach, which is simple but also\nsub-optimal. The optimal channel estimator, based on the minimum\nmean-squared-error (MMSE) criterion, is challenging to obtain and is non-linear\ndue to the non-Gaussianity of the effective channel seen at the receiver. Here\nwe present approaches to approximate the optimal MMSE channel estimator. As a\nfirst approach, we analytically develop the best linear estimator, the LMMSE,\ntogether with a corresponding majorization-minimization based algorithm\ndesigned to optimize the LIS phase shift matrix during the training phase. This\nestimator is shown to yield improved accuracy over the LS approach by\nexploiting second-order statistical properties of the wireless channel and the\nnoise. To further improve performance and better approximate the\nglobally-optimal MMSE channel estimator, we propose data-driven non-linear\nsolutions based on deep learning. Specifically, by posing the MMSE channel\nestimation problem as an image denoising problem, we propose two convolutional\nneural network (CNN) based methods to perform the denoising and approximate the\noptimal MMSE channel estimation solution.

Those notions are adapted to the context of semiparametric\nmodels by applying the inference theory of statistical functionals to the\nfunctional that associates the value of the interest parameter to the\ncorresponding probability measure. The second part of the paper discusses the\ntheory of inference functions for semiparametric models. We define a class of\nregular inference functions, and provide two equivalent characterisations of\nthose inference functions: One adapted from the classic theory of inference\nfunctions for parametric models, and one motivated by differential geometric\nconsiderations concerning the statistical model. Those characterisations yield\nan optimality theory for estimation under semiparametric models.

In\nthis paper I develop a self-consistent and nonperturbative dynamical mean field\ntheory for typical ferrofluids which are often polydisperse, concentrated, and\nstrongly interacting, possibly driven far from equilibrium.

In this paper I put the DEFM on firm theoretical ground by\nderiving it within the framework of dynamical density functional theory (DDFT),\nin which the relevant part of correlation-induced free energy is approximated\nby a function of the instantaneous magnetization. The DEFM is generalized to\ninhomogeneous finite-size samples for which the macroscopic and mesoscopic\nscale separation is nontrivial due to the presence of long-range dipole-dipole\ninteractions. The demagnetizing field naturally emerges from microscopic\nconsiderations and is consistently accounted for.

In paper I it is derived under the framework of dynamical density\nfunctional theory, via which the original ensemble of bare Brownian particles\nis mapped to an ensemble of dressed particles. However, it remains to clarify\nhow the characteristic rotational relaxation time of a dressed particle,\ndenoted by $\\tau_r$, is quantitatively related to that of a bare particle,\ndenoted by $\\tau^0_r$. By building macro-micro connections via two different\nroutes, I reveal that under some gentle assumptions $\\tau_r$ can be identified\nwith the long-time rotational self-diffusion time. I further introduce two\nsimple but useful integrated correlation factors, describing the effects of\nquasi-static (adiabatic) and dynamic (nonadiabatic) inter-particle\ncorrelations, respectively. In terms of both correlation factors I reformulate\nthe dynamic magnetic susceptibility in an illuminating and elegant form.\nRemarkably, it shows that the macro-micro connection is established via two\nsuccessive steps: a dynamical coarse-graining with nonadiabatic effects\naccounted for by the dynamic factor, followed by equilibrium statistical\nmechanical averaging captured by the static factor. Surprisingly,\n$\\tau_r/\\tau^0_r$ is found insensitive to changes of particle volume fraction.\nI provide a physical picture to explain it. Furthermore, an empirical formula\nis proposed to characterize the dependence of $\\tau_r/\\tau^0_r$ on\ndipole-dipole interaction strength. The DEFM supplemented with this formula\nleads to parameter-free predictions in good agreement with results from\nBrownian dynamics simulations.

The\nGrundy (First-Fit) coloring and color-dominating colorings of graphs are two\nwell-known such techniques. The color-dominating colorings are also known and\ncommonly referred as {\\rm b}-colorings. But these two topics have been studied\nseparately in graph theory. We introduce a new coloring procedure which\ncombines the strategies of these two techniques and satisfies an additional\nproperty. We first prove that the vertices of every graph $G$ can be\neffectively colored using color classes say $C_1, \\ldots, C_k$ such that $(i)$\nfor any two colors $i$ and $j$ with $1\\leq i< j \\leq k$, any vertex of color\n$j$ is adjacent to a vertex of color $i$, $(ii)$ there exists a set $\\{u_1,\n\\ldots, u_k\\}$ of vertices of $G$ such that $u_j\\in C_j$ for any $j\\in \\{1,\n\\ldots, k\\}$ and $u_k$ is adjacent to $u_j$ for each $1\\leq j \\leq k$ with\n$j\\not= k$, and $(iii)$ for each $i$ and $j$ with $i\\not= j$, the vertex $u_j$\nhas a neighbor in $C_i$. This provides a new vertex coloring heuristic which\nimproves both Grundy and color-dominating colorings. Denote by $z(G)$ the\nmaximum number of colors used in any proper vertex coloring satisfying the\nabove properties. The $z(G)$ quantifies the worst-case behavior of the\nheuristic.

The Newman-Janis algorithm provides a\nprocedure to obtain rotating spacetimes from a static, spherically symmetric,\nseed metric. It is not guaranteed, however, that the resulting rotating\nspacetime solves the same field equations as the seed. Moreover, the former may\nnot be circular, and thus expressible in Boyer-Lindquist-like coordinates.\nAmongst the variations of the original procedure, a modified Newman-Janis\nalgorithm (MNJA) has been proposed that, by construction, originates a\ncircular, spinning spacetime, expressible in Boyer-Lindquist-like coordinates.\nAs a down side, the procedure introduces an ambiguity, that requires extra\nassumptions on the matter content of the model. In this paper we observe that\nthe rotating spacetimes obtained through the MNJA always admit separability of\nthe Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the case of null geodesics, in which case,\nmoreover, the aforementioned ambiguity has no impact, since it amounts to an\noverall metric conformal factor.

However,\nsafe answer problems pose significant challenges to text generation tasks, and\ne-commerce question-answering task is no exception. To generate more meaningful\nanswers, in this paper, we propose a novel generative neural model, called the\nMeaningful Product Answer Generator (MPAG), which alleviates the safe answer\nproblem by taking product reviews, product attributes, and a prototype answer\ninto consideration. Product reviews and product attributes are used to provide\nmeaningful content, while the prototype answer can yield a more diverse answer\npattern.

Here, we use\nthe second Gaia Data Release (DR2) to search for companions to 1534\nrotation-powered pulsars with positions known to better than 0.5 arcseconds.

Embedding\nknowledge graphs into continuous vector spaces has recently attracted\nincreasing interest in knowledge base completion. However, in most existing\nembedding methods, only fact triplets are utilized, and logical rules have not\nbeen thoroughly studied for the knowledge base completion task. To overcome the\nproblem, we propose an association rules enhanced knowledge graph attention\nnetwork (AR-KGAT). The AR-KGAT captures both entity and relation features for\nhigh-order neighborhoods of any given entity in an end-to-end manner under the\ngraph attention network framework. The major component of AR-KGAT is an encoder\nof an effective neighborhood aggregator, which addresses the problems by\naggregating neighbors with both association-rules-based and graph-based\nattention weights. Additionally, the proposed model also encapsulates the\nrepresentations from multi-hop neighbors of nodes to refine their embeddings.\nThe decoder enables AR-KGAT to be translational between entities and relations\nwhile keeping the superior link prediction performance. A logic-like inference\npattern is utilized as constraints for knowledge graph embedding. Then, the\nglobal loss is minimized over both atomic and complex formulas to achieve the\nembedding task. In this manner, we learn embeddings compatible with triplets\nand rules, which are certainly more predictive for knowledge acquisition and\ninference. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets: WN18RR\nand FB15k-237, for two knowledge graph completion tasks: the link prediction\nand triplet classification to evaluate the proposed AR-KGAT model.

We empirically evaluate the embeddings of the two single\nmodalities in their accuracy and generalizability of CPAC prediction (i.e.\nstructure-free interpretable compound-protein affinity prediction).

Currently, object\ndetection models utilize shared feature map to complete classification and\nlocalization tasks simultaneously. By comparing the performance between the\noriginal Faster R-CNN and that with partially separated feature maps, we show\nthat: (1) Sharing high-level features for the classification and localization\ntasks is sub-optimal; (2) Large stride is beneficial for classification but\nharmful for localization; (3) Global context information could improve the\nperformance of classification. Based on these findings, we proposed a paradigm\ncalled Gap-optimized region based convolutional network (G-RCN), which aims to\nseparating these two tasks and optimizing the gap between them. The paradigm\nwas firstly applied to correct the current ResNet protocol by simply reducing\nthe stride and moving the Conv5 block from the head to the feature extraction\nnetwork, which brings 3.6 improvement of AP70 on the PASCAL VOC dataset and 1.5\nimprovement of AP on the COCO dataset for ResNet50. Next, the new method is\napplied on the Faster R-CNN with backbone of VGG16,ResNet50 and ResNet101,\nwhich brings above 2.0 improvement of AP70 on the PASCAL VOC dataset and above\n1.9 improvement of AP on the COCO dataset. Noticeably, the implementation of\nG-RCN only involves a few structural modifications, with no extra module added.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 04:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}
