For\nGaussian open quantum systems exemplified by the quantum Brownian motion model\nstudied here, a time-varying effective temperature can be introduced in a\nnatural way, and with it, the nonequilibrium free energy\n$\\mathcal{F}_{\\textsc{s}}$, von Neumann entropy $\\mathcal{S}_{vN}$ and internal\nenergy $\\mathcal{U}_{\\textsc{s}}$ of the reduced system ($S$) can be defined\naccordingly. In contrast to the nonequilibrium free energy found in the\nliterature which references the bath temperature, the nonequilibrium\nthermodynamic functions we find here obey the familiar relation\n$\\mathcal{F}_{\\textsc{s}}(t)=\\mathcal{U}_{\\textsc{s}}(t)- T_{\\textsc{eff}}\n(t)\\,\\mathcal{S}_{vN}(t)$ {\\it at any and all moments of time} in the system's\nfully nonequilibrium evolution history. After the system equilibrates they\ncoincide, in the weak coupling limit, with their counterparts in conventional\nequilibrium thermodynamics. Since the effective temperature captures both the\nstate of the system and its interaction with the bath, upon the system's\nequilibration, it approaches a value slightly higher than the initial bath\ntemperature. Notably, it remains nonzero for a zero-temperature bath, signaling\nthe existence of system-bath entanglement. Reasonably, at high bath\ntemperatures and under ultra-weak couplings, it becomes indistinguishable from\nthe bath temperature. The nonequilibrium thermodynamic functions and relations\ndiscovered here for dynamical Gaussian quantum systems should open up useful\npathways toward establishing meaningful theories of nonequilibrium quantum\nthermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 16:01:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 15:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

Our theoretical model suggests\npressure driven significant splitting of the in-plane Mn bond lengths $i.e.$ an\neffective trimerization, which in turn stabilizes a helical AFM ground state by\nmodifying the inter-plane exchange parameters in the system. We experimentally\ndemonstrate that the AHE in Mn$_3$Sn reduces from 5$\\mu\\Omega$ cm at ambient\npressure to zero at an applied pressure of about 1.5 GPa. Furthermore, our\npressure dependent magnetization study reveals that the conventional triangular\nAFM ground state of Mn$_3$Sn systematically transforms into the helical AFM\nphase where the symmetry does not support a non-vanishing Berry curvature\nrequired for the realization of a finite AHE. The pressure dependent x-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) study rules out any role of structural phase transition in\nthe observed phenomenon. In addition, the temperature dependent in-plane\nlattice parameter at ambient pressure is found to deviate from the monotonic\nbehavior when the system enters into the helical AFM phase, thereby, supporting\nthe proposed impact of trimerization in controlling the AHE.

In retrospect,\nthe model turns out to be a digital analogue for the well-known SIR model of\nKermac and McKendrick (1927). In our RGB model, the number of accumulated\ninfections goes through three phases, beginning at a very low level, then\nchanging to a transition ramp of rapid growth, and ending in a plateau of final\nvalues. Consequently, the differential change or growth rate begins at 0, rises\nto a peak corresponding to the maximum slope of the transition ramp, and then\nfalls back to 0. The properties of these time variations, including the slope,\nduration, and height of the transition ramp, and the width and height of the\ninfection rate, depend on a single parameter - the time that a red molecule is\ncontagious divided by the average time between collisions of the molecules.\nVarious temporal milestones, including the starting time of the transition\nramp, the time that the accumulating number of infections obtains its maximum\nslope, and the location of the peak of the infection rate depend on the size of\nthe population in addition to the contagious lifetime ratio.

Several notions of topological entropy have\nbeen proposed to solve this problem for closed and switched systems. In this\npaper, we extend these notions to open nonlinear dynamical systems with\nslowly-varying inputs to lower bound the bit rate needed to estimate their\nstates. Our entropy definition represents the rate of exponential increase of\nthe number of functions needed to approximate the trajectories of the system up\nto a specified $\\eps$ error. We show that alternative entropy definitions using\nspanning or separating trajectories bound ours from both sides. On the other\nhand, we show that the existing definitions of entropy that consider supremum\nover all $\\eps$ or require exponential convergence of estimation error, are not\nsuitable for open systems. Since the actual value of entropy is generally hard\nto compute, we derive an upper bound instead and compute it for two examples.\nWe show that as the bound on the input variation decreases, we recover a\npreviously known bound on estimation entropy for closed nonlinear systems. For\nthe sake of computing the bound, we present an algorithm that, given sampled\nand quantized measurements from a trajectory and an input signal up to a time\nbound $T>0$, constructs a function that approximates the trajectory up to an\n$\\eps$ error. We show that this algorithm can also be used for state estimation\nif the input signal can indeed be sensed. Finally, we relate the computed bound\nwith a previously known upper bound on the entropy for switched nonlinear\nsystems. We show that a bound on the divergence between the different modes of\na switched system is needed to get a meaningful bound on its entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 16:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-23"}

The collapse of each\nprogenitor was simulated four times, at two different grid resolutions and with\ntwo different neutrino transport methods, using the Aenus-Alcar code. The main\ngoal of this study is to assess the validity of recent concerns that the\nso-called \"Ray-by-Ray+\" (RbR+) approximation is problematic in core-collapse\nsimulations and can adversely affect theoretical GW predictions. Therefore,\nsignals from simulations using RbR+ are compared to signals from corresponding\nsimulations using a fully multidimensional (FMD) transport scheme.

Both the standing accretion shock instability and hot-bubble\nconvection develop in the postshock layer of the non-exploding models. In the\nexploding models, neutrino-driven convection in the postshock flow is\nestablished around 100 ms after core bounce and lasts until the onset of shock\nrevival.

Extratidal stars are stellar bodies that end up outside the tidal\nradius of a cluster as a result of internal processes or external forces acting\nupon it. The presence and spatial distribution of these stars can give us\ninsights into the past evolution of a cluster inside our Galaxy. Aims. Previous\nworks suggest that globular clusters, when explored in detail, show evidence of\nextratidal stars. We aim to search for possible extratidal stars in the\nGalactic globular clusters NGC 6397, NGC 2808, and NGC 6266 using the\nphotometry and proper motion measurements from Gaia DR2 database (Gaia\nCollaboration et al. 2018). Results. Finally, 120, 126, and 107 extratidal\ncandidate stars were found lying outside the tidal radius of the globular\nclusters NGC 6397, NGC 2808, and NGC 6266, respectively. 70%, 25.4%, and 72.9%\nof the extratidal stars found are located outside the Jacobi radius of NGC\n6397, NGC 2808, and NGC 6266, respectively. The spatial distribution of the\nextratidal stars belonging to NGC 6397 appears S-like, extending along the\ncurved leading and trailing arms. NGC 2808 has an overdensity of stars in the\ntrailing part of the cluster and NGC 6266 seems to have overdensities of\nextratidal stars in its eastern and northern sides. Conclusions. Proper motions\nand color-magnitude diagrams can be used to identify extratidal candidate stars\naround GCs.

This disruption in signaling\ninterrupts normal cellular functions and may eventually develop some\npathological conditions. In this paper, computation capacity of signaling\nnetworks is introduced as a fundamental limit on signaling capability and\nperformance of such networks. The computation capacity measures the maximum\nnumber of computable inputs, that is, the maximum number of input values for\nwhich the correct functional output values can be recovered from the erroneous\nnetwork outputs, when the network contains some dysfunctional molecules. This\ncontrasts with the conventional communication capacity that measures instead\nthe maximum number of input values that can be correctly distinguished based on\nthe erroneous network outputs.\n  The computation capacity is higher than the communication capacity, if the\nnetwork response function is not a one-to-one function of the input signals. By\nexplicitly incorporating the effect of signaling errors that result in the\nnetwork dysfunction, the computation capacity provides more information about\nthe network and its malfunction. Two examples of signaling networks are studied\nhere, one regulating caspase3 and another regulating NFkB, for which\ncomputation and communication capacities are analyzed. Higher computation\ncapacities are observed for both networks. One biological implication of this\nfinding is that signaling networks may have more capacity than that specified\nby the conventional communication capacity metric.

New IRAM 30m HERA\nCO(2-1) data of NGC 4654 are used to study the physical conditions of the ISM.\nThe CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor was estimated and found to be one to two\ntimes the Galactic value with significant decrease in the ratio between the\nmolecular fraction and the total ISM pressure in the HSDR, self-gravitating\ngas, a Toomre parameter below $Q=1$ and star-formation efficiency 1.5-2 times\nhigher.

Dynamically, depending on the\nversioning variable's value, either the specialized fast path or the default\nslow path will execute.

Investigating the individual properties and\ndemographics of early passive galaxies will improve our understanding of these\nmechanisms. In this work we present a follow-up analysis of the z>3 passive\ngalaxy candidates selected by Merlin et al. (2019) in the CANDELS fields. We\nbegin by first confirming the accuracy of their passive classification by\nexploiting their sub-mm emission to demonstrate the lack of ongoing SF. Using\narchival ALMA observations we are able to confirm at least 61% of the observed\ncandidates as passive. While the remainder lack sufficiently deep data for\nconfirmation, we are able to validate the entire sample in a statistical sense.\nWe then estimate the Stellar Mass Function (SMF) of all 101 passive candidates\nin three redshift bins from z=5 to z=3. We adopt a stepwise approach that has\nthe advantage of taking into account photometric errors, observational\nincompleteness, and the Eddington bias without any a-posteriori correction. We\nobserve a pronounced evolution in the SMF around z~4, indicating that we are\nwitnessing the emergence of the passive population at this epoch. Massive\n(M>10^11Msun) passive galaxies, only accounting for a small (<10%) fraction of\ngalaxies at z>4, become dominant at later epochs. Thanks to a combination of\nphotometric quality, sample selection and methodology, we overall find a higher\ndensity of passive galaxies than previous works. The comparison with\ntheoretical predictions, despite a qualitative agreement, denotes a still\nincomplete understanding of the physical processes responsible for the\nformation of these galaxies. Finally, we extrapolate our results to predict the\nnumber of early passive galaxies expected in surveys carried out with future\nfacilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 19:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 19:35:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 13:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

Using these loss functions, it is possible to extend the concept of\n'domain' to include arbitrary user defined labels applicable to subsets of the\ntraining data, the test data, or both. As such, the network can be operated in\neither 'On the Fly' mode where features provided by the feature extractor\nindicative of differences between 'domain' labels in the training data are\nremoved or in 'Test Collection Informed' mode where features indicative of\ndifference between 'domain' labels in the combined training and test data are\nremoved (without needing to know or provide test activity labels to the\nnetwork). This work also draws heavily from previous works on Robust Training\nwhich draws training examples from a L_inf ball around the training data in\norder to remove fragile features induced by random fluctuations in the data. On\nthese networks we explore the process of hyperparameter optimization for both\nthe domain adversarial and robust hyperparameters. Finally, this network is\napplied to the construction of a binary classifier used to identify the\npresence of EM signal emitted by a turbopump.

Because transitions between the amorphous and crystalline phases lead\nto significant changes in material properties (e.g., refractive index and\nresistivity), GeTe has been investigated as a phase-change material for\nphotonics, thermoelectrics, ferroelectrics, and spintronics. Consequently, the\ntemperature-dependent phase transitions in GeTe have been studied for bulk and\nthin-film GeTe, both fabricated by sputtering. Colloidal synthesis of\nnanoparticles offers a more flexible fabrication approach for amorphous and\ncrystalline GeTe. These nanoparticles are known to exhibit size-dependent\nproperties, such as an increased crystallization temperature for the\namorphous-to-$\\alpha$ transition in sub-10\\,nm GeTe particles. The\n$\\alpha$-to-$\\beta$ phase transition is also expected to vary with size, but\nthis effect has not yet been investigated for GeTe. Here, we report\ntime-resolved X-ray diffraction of GeTe nanoparticles with different diameters\nand from different synthetic protocols.

The latter transition was reversible and repeatable. While the\ntransition temperatures are shifted relative to the values known for bulk GeTe,\nthe nanoparticle-based samples still exhibit the same structural phases\nreported for sputtered GeTe. Thus, colloidal GeTe maintains the same general\nphase behavior as bulk GeTe while allowing for more flexible and accessible\nfabrication. Therefore, nanoparticle-based GeTe films show great potential for\napplications, such as in active photonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 20:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Analogous to the MaaS, the core idea of the CaaS is to\ndispatch service vehicles (SVs) that carry modular battery units (MBUs) to\nprovide LDEVs for mobility service with on-demand battery delivery. The CaaS\nsystem is expected to tackle major bottlenecks of a large-scale LDEV adoption\nin the MaaS industry due to the lack of charging infrastructure and excess\nwaiting and charging time. A hybrid agent-based simulation model (HABM) is\ndeveloped to model the dynamics of the CaaS system with SV agents, and a\ntrip-based stationary charging probability distribution is introduced to\nsimulate the generation of charging demand for LDEVs. Two dispatching\nalgorithms are further developed to support the optimal operation of the CaaS.\nThe model is validated by assuming electrifying all 13,000 yellow taxis in New\nYork City (NYC) that follow the same daily trip patterns.

In this paper, we put forth a novel formulation of the\nobject detection problem, namely open-vocabulary object detection, which is\nmore general, more practical, and more effective than weakly supervised and\nzero-shot approaches. We propose a new method to train object detectors using\nbounding box annotations for a limited set of object categories, as well as\nimage-caption pairs that cover a larger variety of objects at a significantly\nlower cost. We show that the proposed method can detect and localize objects\nfor which no bounding box annotation is provided during training, at a\nsignificantly higher accuracy than zero-shot approaches. Meanwhile, objects\nwith bounding box annotation can be detected almost as accurately as supervised\nmethods, which is significantly better than weakly supervised baselines.\nAccordingly, we establish a new state of the art for scalable object detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 23:05:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 18:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

To acquire high-fidelity\nimages, CST is typically implemented by line-of-sight Wavelength Modulation\nSpectroscopy (WMS) measurements from multiple laser beams. The modulated\ntransmission signal on each laser beam needs to be a) digitised by a high-speed\nanalogue-to-digital converter (ADC); b) demodulated by a digital lock-in (DLI)\nmodule; and c) transferred to high-level processor for image reconstruction.\nAlthough a fully parallel data acquisition (DAQ) and signal processing system\ncan achieve these functionalities with maximised temporal response, it leads to\na highly complex, expensive and power-consuming instrumentation system with\nhigh potential for inconsistency between the sampled beams due to the\nelectronics alone. In addition, the huge amount of spectral data sampled in\nparallel significantly burdens the communication process in industrial\napplications where in situ signal digitisation is distanced from the high-level\ndata processing. To address these issues, a quasi-parallel sensing technique\nand electronic circuits were developed for industrial CST, in which the\ndigitisation and demodulation of the multi-beam transmission signals are\nmultiplexed over the high-frequency modulation within a wavelength scan. Our\ndevelopment not only maintains the temporal response of the fully parallel\nsensing scheme, but also facilitates the cost-effective implementation of\nindustrial CST with very low complexity and reduced load on data transfer. The\nproposed technique is analytically proven, numerically examined by\nnoise-contaminated CST simulations, and experimentally validated using a\nlab-scale CST system with 32 laser beams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 23:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

There are two types of string effects: one is an $S^z$ string that\nis repairable by quantum spin flips and the other is a phase string irreparable\nby the spin flips. We investigate the effect of $S^{z}$ and phase strings on\nMIR weights. Calculating the optical conductivity of the single-hole Hubbard\nmodel in the strong-coupling regime and the $t$-$J$ model on two-leg ladders by\nusing time-dependent Lanczos and density-matrix renormalization group, we find\nthat phase strings make a crucial effect on the emergence of MIR weights as\ncompared with $S^{z}$ strings. Our findings indicate that a mutual Chern-Simons\ngauge field acting between spin and charge degrees of freedom, which is the\norigin of phase strings, is significant for obtaining MIR weights. Conversely,\nif we remove this gauge field, no phase is picked up by a doped hole. As a\nresult, a spin-polaron accompanied by a local spin distortion emerges and a\nquasiparticle with a cosine-like energy dispersion is formed in single-particle\nspectral function.

We develop an adaptively-robust-learning (ARL) pricing policy that\nlearns the true model parameters from the data while actively managing demand\nmodel ambiguity. It optimizes an objective that is robust with respect to a\nself-adapting set of demand models, where a given model is included in this set\nonly if the sales data revealed from prior pricing decisions makes it\n\"probable\".

We then propose a new sketching\ntechnique, called LEverage Score Sparsified (LESS) embeddings, which uses ideas\nfrom both data-oblivious sparse embeddings as well as data-aware leverage-based\nrow sampling methods, to get $\\epsilon$ inversion bias for sketch size\n$m=O(d\\log d+\\sqrt d/\\epsilon)$ in time $O(\\text{nnz}(A)\\log n+md^2)$, where\nnnz is the number of non-zeros. The key techniques enabling our analysis\ninclude an extension of a classical inequality of Bai and Silverstein for\nrandom quadratic forms, which we call the Restricted Bai-Silverstein\ninequality; and anti-concentration of the Binomial distribution via the\nPaley-Zygmund inequality, which we use to prove a lower bound showing that\nleverage score sampling sketches generally do not achieve small inversion bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 01:33:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 01:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

While model-based approaches are among the most data\nefficient learning algorithms, they still struggle with complex tasks and model\nuncertainties.

Such\ninstability is characterized by the localization of the displacement or\nvelocity fields in a zone of finite thickness and is generally associated with\nthe failure of materials. In several fields of material engineering and natural\nsciences, estimating the thickness of localized deformation is required to make\naccurate predictions of the evolution of the physical properties within\nlocalized strain regions and of the material strength. In this context,\nscientists and engineers often rely on numerical modeling techniques to study\nstrain localization in solid materials.

To address this\ninsufficiency, we reformulate VQA as a full answer generation task, which\nrequires the model to justify its predictions in natural language. We propose\nLRTA [Look, Read, Think, Answer], a transparent neural-symbolic reasoning\nframework for visual question answering that solves the problem step-by-step\nlike humans and provides human-readable form of justification at each step.\nSpecifically, LRTA learns to first convert an image into a scene graph and\nparse a question into multiple reasoning instructions. It then executes the\nreasoning instructions one at a time by traversing the scene graph using a\nrecurrent neural-symbolic execution module. Finally, it generates a full answer\nto the given question with natural language justifications.

Similar to conventional $\\tau$-leaping\nthe algorithm proceeds in discrete time steps, but as a principal addition it\ncaptures environmental noise beyond the adiabatic limit. The key idea is to\ntreat the input rates for the $\\tau$-leaping as (clipped) Gaussian random\nvariables with first and second moments constructed from the environmental\nprocess. In this way, each step of the algorithm retains environmental\nstochasticity to sub-leading order in the time scale separation between system\nand environment. We test the algorithm on several toy examples with discrete\nand continuous environmental states, and find good performance in the regime of\nfast environmental dynamics. At the same time, the algorithm requires\nsignificantly less computing time than full simulations of the combined system\nand environment. In this context we also discuss several methods for the\nsimulation of stochastic population dynamics in time-varying environments with\ncontinuous states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 08:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

First, most existing approaches focus only on the end\nresults, namely, increasing the success rate of BCSA, by adopting\nuninterpretable machine learning. Moreover, they utilize their own benchmark,\nsharing neither the source code nor the entire dataset. Finally, researchers\noften use different terminologies or even use the same technique without citing\nthe previous literature properly, which makes it difficult to reproduce or\nextend previous work.

Our study reveals various useful insights on BCSA.

However, developing a\nsuccessful theory of star formation will require measurements of both the mean\nvalue of $\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$ and its scatter from one molecular cloud to\nanother. Because $\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$ is measured relative to the free-fall\ntime, such measurements require accurate determinations of cloud volume\ndensities. Efforts to measure the volume density from two-dimensional projected\ndata, however, have thus far relied on treating molecular clouds as simple\nuniform spheres, while their real shapes are likely filamentary and their\ndensity distributions far from uniform. The resulting uncertainty in the true\nvolume density is likely one of the major sources of error in observational\nestimates of $\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$. In this paper, we use a suite of simulations\nof turbulent, magnetized, radiative, self-gravitating star-forming clouds to\nexamine whether it is possible to obtain more accurate volume density estimates\nand thereby reduce this error.

We build a predictive model that uses information accessible in\ntwo-dimensional measurements -- most significantly the Gini coefficient of the\nsurface density distribution -- to estimate volume density with ~ 0.3 dex less\nscatter.

Carefully crafted\nperturbations, imperceptible to human vision, can be added to images to force\nmisclassification by an otherwise high performing neural network. To have a\nbetter understanding of the key contributors of such structured attacks, we\nsearched for and studied spatially co-located patterns in the distribution of\npixels in the input space. In this paper, we propose a framework for\nsegregating and isolating regions within an input image which are particularly\ncritical towards either classification (during inference), or adversarial\nvulnerability or both. We assert that during inference, the trained model looks\nat a specific region in the image, which we call Region of Importance (RoI);\nand the attacker looks at a region to alter/modify, which we call Region of\nAttack (RoA). The success of this approach could also be used to design a\npost-hoc adversarial defence method, as illustrated by our observations. This\nuses the notion of blocking out (we call neutralizing) that region of the image\nwhich is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks but is not important for the\ntask of classification. We establish the theoretical setup for formalising the\nprocess of segregation, isolation and neutralization and substantiate it\nthrough empirical analysis on standard benchmarking datasets. The findings\nstrongly indicate that mapping features into the input space preserves the\nsignificant patterns typically observed in the feature-space while adding major\ninterpretability and therefore simplifies potential defensive mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 14:06:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

D3Net involves a novel multidilated convolution\nthat has different dilation factors in a single layer to model different\nresolutions simultaneously. By combining the multidilated convolution with the\nDenseNet architecture, D3Net incorporates multiresolution learning with an\nexponentially growing receptive field in almost all layers, while avoiding the\naliasing problem that occurs when we naively incorporate the dilated\nconvolution in DenseNet. Experiments on the image semantic segmentation task\nusing Cityscapes and the audio source separation task using MUSDB18 show that\nthe proposed method has superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 05:15:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 00:31:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

Existing methods, such as\nBayesian-based and genetic-based optimisation, which are implemented in\nAuto-Weka, Auto-sklearn and TPOT, evaluate pipelines by executing them.\nTherefore, the pipeline composition and optimisation of these methods\nfrequently require a tremendous amount of time that prevents them from\nexploring complex pipelines to find better predictive models. To further\nexplore this research challenge, we have conducted experiments showing that\nmany of the generated pipelines are invalid in the first place, and attempting\nto execute them is a waste of time and resources. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel method to evaluate the validity of ML pipelines, without their\nexecution, using a surrogate model (AVATAR). The AVATAR generates a knowledge\nbase by automatically learning the capabilities and effects of ML algorithms on\ndatasets' characteristics. This knowledge base is used for a simplified mapping\nfrom an original ML pipeline to a surrogate model which is a Petri net based\npipeline. Instead of executing the original ML pipeline to evaluate its\nvalidity, the AVATAR evaluates its surrogate model constructed by capabilities\nand effects of the ML pipeline components and input/output simplified mappings.\nEvaluating this surrogate model is less resource-intensive than the execution\nof the original pipeline. As a result, the AVATAR enables the pipeline\ncomposition and optimisation methods to evaluate more pipelines by quickly\nrejecting invalid pipelines. We integrate the AVATAR into the sequential\nmodel-based algorithm configuration (SMAC). Our experiments show that when SMAC\nemploys AVATAR, it finds better solutions than on its own.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 14:05:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

The\nexisting methods normally detect where the characters are, and then recognize\nthe character for each detected location. Thus the accuracy of characters\nrecognition is impacted by the performance of characters detection. In this\npaper, we propose a method for recognizing characters without detecting the\nlocation of each character. This is done by converting the OCR task into an\nimage captioning task. One advantage of the proposed method is that the labeled\nbounding boxes for the characters are not needed during training. The\nexperimental results show the proposed method outperforms the existing methods\non both the license plate recognition and the watermeter character recognition\ntasks. The proposed method is also deployed into a low-power (300mW) CNN\naccelerator chip connected to a Raspberry Pi 3 for on-device applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 06:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

This paper examines the Internet security perception of Filipinos to\nestablish a need and sense of urgency on the part of the government to create a\nculture of cybersecurity for every Filipino. Method. A quantitative survey was\nconducted through traditional, online, and phone interviews among 252\nrespondents using a two-page questionnaire that covers basic demographic\ninformation and two key elements (1) Internet usage and (2) security practices.\nResults. Based on findings, there is a sharp increase in Internet users for the\nlast three years (50%), and most access to the Internet through mobile (94.4%).\nAlthough at home is the most frequent location for Internet access (94.4%), a\ngood percentage still use free WiFi access points available in malls (22.2%),\nrestaurants (11.1%), and other public areas (38.9%) doing Internet services\n(email and downloading) that are vulnerable to cyberattacks. The study also\nrevealed that although respondents may have good knowledge of Internet security\nsoftware, proper implementation is very limited. Conclusion. Filipinos are\nsusceptible to cyberattacks, particularly to phishing and malware attacks.\nAlso, the majority of the respondents' Internet security perception is\nderivative: they practice online measures but with a limited understanding of\nthe purpose. Therefore proper education, through training and awareness, is an\neffective approach to remedy the situation. Recommendations. The Philippine\ngovernment must now take actions and tap industries to educate Filipinos about\nInternet security before any negative consequences happen in the future.\nResearch Implications. The information collected sets a clear picture of the\nimportance of cybersecurity awareness from a regional to a global perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 02:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

In this paper, we study model-based posterior sampling for reinforcement\nlearning (PSRL) in continuous state-action spaces theoretically and\nempirically. First, we show the first regret bound of PSRL in continuous spaces\nwhich is polynomial in the episode length to the best of our knowledge. With\nthe assumption that reward and transition functions can be modeled by Bayesian\nlinear regression, we develop a regret bound of $\\tilde{O}(H^{3/2}d\\sqrt{T})$,\nwhere $H$ is the episode length, $d$ is the dimension of the state-action\nspace, and $T$ indicates the total time steps. This result matches the\nbest-known regret bound of non-PSRL methods in linear MDPs. Our bound can be\nextended to nonlinear cases as well with feature embedding: using linear\nkernels on the feature representation $\\phi$, the regret bound becomes\n$\\tilde{O}(H^{3/2}d_{\\phi}\\sqrt{T})$, where $d_\\phi$ is the dimension of the\nrepresentation space. Moreover, we present MPC-PSRL, a model-based posterior\nsampling algorithm with model predictive control for action selection. To\ncapture the uncertainty in models, we use Bayesian linear regression on the\npenultimate layer (the feature representation layer $\\phi$) of neural networks.\nEmpirical results show that our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art sample\nefficiency in benchmark continuous control tasks compared to prior model-based\nalgorithms, and matches the asymptotic performance of model-free algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 21:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 20:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}
