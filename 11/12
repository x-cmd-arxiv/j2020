But\ndespite current success, it suffers from inferior performance when translations\nbetween classes require large shape changes. We attribute this to the\nhigh-resolution bottlenecks which are used by current state-of-the-art\nimage-to-image methods. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel deep\nhierarchical Image-to-Image Translation method, called DeepI2I. We learn a\nmodel by leveraging hierarchical features: (a) structural information contained\nin the shallow layers and (b) semantic information extracted from the deep\nlayers. To enable the training of deep I2I models on small datasets, we propose\na novel transfer learning method, that transfers knowledge from pre-trained\nGANs. Specifically, we leverage the discriminator of a pre-trained GANs (i.e.\nBigGAN or StyleGAN) to initialize both the encoder and the discriminator and\nthe pre-trained generator to initialize the generator of our model. Applying\nknowledge transfer leads to an alignment problem between the encoder and\ngenerator. We introduce an adaptor network to address this. On many-class\nimage-to-image translation on three datasets (Animal faces, Birds, and Foods)\nwe decrease mFID by at least 35% when compared to the state-of-the-art.\nFurthermore, we qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that transfer\nlearning significantly improves the performance of I2I systems, especially for\nsmall datasets.

In general, such\nSRL problems have nonconvex objective functions subject to multiple nonconvex\nconstraints, and hence are very challenging to solve, particularly to provide a\nglobally optimal policy. Many popular SRL algorithms adopt a primal-dual\nstructure which utilizes the updating of dual variables for satisfying the\nconstraints. In contrast, we propose a primal approach, called\nconstraint-rectified policy optimization (CRPO), which updates the policy\nalternatingly between objective improvement and constraint satisfaction. CRPO\nprovides a primal-type algorithmic framework to solve SRL problems, where each\npolicy update can take any variant of policy optimization step. To demonstrate\nthe theoretical performance of CRPO, we adopt natural policy gradient (NPG) for\neach policy update step and show that CRPO achieves an\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate to the global optimal policy in the\nconstrained policy set and an $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ error bound on\nconstraint satisfaction.

While\nproviding excellent accuracy, they often have enormous compute and memory\nrequirements. As a result of this, quantized neural networks (QNNs) are\nincreasingly being adopted and deployed especially on embedded devices, thanks\nto their high accuracy, but also since they have significantly lower compute\nand memory requirements compared to their floating point equivalents. QNN\ndeployment is also being evaluated for safety-critical applications, such as\nautomotive, avionics, medical or industrial. These systems require functional\nsafety, guaranteeing failure-free behaviour even in the presence of hardware\nfaults. In general fault tolerance can be achieved by adding redundancy to the\nsystem, which further exacerbates the overall computational demands and makes\nit difficult to meet the power and performance requirements. In order to\ndecrease the hardware cost for achieving functional safety, it is vital to\nexplore domain-specific solutions which can exploit the inherent features of\nDNNs.

Moreover, the codes can be\nencoded in time $\\mathrm{poly}(1/\\epsilon, n)$, the output list is contained in\na linear subspace of dimension at most $\\mathrm{poly}(1/\\epsilon)$, and a basis\nfor this subspace can be found in time $\\mathrm{poly}(1/\\epsilon, n)$.

The results\nobtained from the comparative study are also compared with the predictions of a\nmodel for silicate dust condensation solely based on laboratory data and basic\nstellar properties. The infrared emission in the wavelength range between 6 and\n25 mu can be reproduced rather well by a mixture of non-stoichiometric\niron-bearing silicates, alumina, and metallic iron dust particles for all nine\nobjects. The observed spectra obtained from three objects, mu Cep, RW Cyg, and\nRS Per, can be reproduced by a stationary and (essentially) spherically\nsymmetric outflow which enables a direct comparison with predictions from a\ntheoretical dust growth model. The temperature at the onset of massive silicate\ndust growth is of the order of 920 K and the corresponding outflow velocity of\nthe order of the sound velocity for these objects. The condensation temperature\nsuggests that the silicate dust grows on the corundum dust grains that are\nformed well in the interior of the silicate dust shell at a much higher\ntemperature. Our results propose that regarding the two major problems of dust\nformation in stellar outflows: (i) formation of seed nuclei; (ii) their growth\nto macroscopic dust grains, we are gradually coming close to a quantitative\nunderstanding of the second item.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 16:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

Although\ninfrastructure providers are working toward creating managed edge networks,\npersonal devices such as laptops and tablets, which are widely available and\nare underutilized, can also be used as potential edge devices. We call such\ndevices Unmanaged Edge Devices (UEDs). Scheduling application tasks on such an\nunmanaged edge system is not straightforward because of three fundamental\nreasons-heterogeneity in the computational capacity of the UEDs, uncertainty in\nthe availability of the UEDs (due to devices leaving the system), and\ninterference among multiple tasks sharing a UED. In this paper, we present\nI-BOT, an interference-based orchestration scheme for latency-sensitive tasks\non an Unmanaged Edge Platform (UEP). It minimizes the completion time of\napplications and is bandwidth efficient. I-BOT brings forth three innovations.\nFirst, it profiles and predicts the interference patterns of the tasks to make\nscheduling decisions. Second, it uses a feedback mechanism to adjust for\nchanges in the computational capacity of the UEDs and a prediction mechanism to\nhandle their sporadic exits. Third, it accounts for input dependence of tasks\nin its scheduling decision (such as, two tasks requiring the same input data).\nTo evaluate I-BOT, we run end-to-end simulations with applications representing\nautonomous driving, composed of multiple tasks.

The patients can use their smart devices to create, store and\nshare their electronic health records (EHR) with a variety of medical personnel\nincluding medical doctors and nurses. However, unless the underlying\ncombination within IoMT is secured, malicious users can intercept, modify and\neven delete the sensitive EHR data of patients. Patients also lose full control\nof their EHR since most health services within IoMT are constructed under a\ncentralized platform outsourced in the cloud. Therefore, it is appealing to\ndesign a decentralized, auditable and secure EHR system that guarantees\nabsolute access control for the patients while ensuring privacy and security.\nUsing the features of blockchain including decentralization, auditability and\nimmutability, we propose a secure EHR framework which is mainly maintained by\nthe medical centers. In this framework, the patients' EHR data are encrypted\nand stored in the servers of medical institutions while the corresponding hash\nvalues are kept on the blockchain. We make use of security primitives to offer\nauthentication, integrity and confidentiality of EHR data while access control\nand immutability is guaranteed by the blockchain technology. The security\nanalysis and performance evaluation of the proposed framework confirms its\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 17:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

Despite the abundance of studies of mass segregation for stellar\nclusters, those for stellar progenitors are still scarce, so the question on\nthe origin and evolution of mass segregation is still open. Our goal is to\ncharacterize the structure of the NGC 2264 molecular cloud and compare the\npopulations of clumps and young stellar objects (YSOs) in this region whose\nrich YSO population has shown evidence of sequential star formation. We\nseparated the Herschel column density map of NGC 2264 in three subregions and\ncompared their cloud power spectra using a multiscale segmentation technique.\nWe identified in the whole NGC 2264 cloud a population of 256 clumps with\ntypical sizes of ~0.1 pc and masses ranging from 0.08 Msun to 53 Msun. Although\nclumps have been detected all over the cloud, the central subregion of NGC 2264\nconcentrates most of the massive, bound clumps. The local surface density and\nthe mass segregation ratio indeed indicate a strong degree of mass segregation\nfor the 15 most massive clumps, with a median $\\Sigma_6$ three time that of the\nwhole clumps population and $\\Lambda_{MSR}$ about 8. We showed that this\ncluster of massive clumps is forming within a high-density cloud ridge, itself\nformed and probably still fed by the high concentration of gas observed on\nlarger scales in the central subregion. The time sequence obtained from the\ncombined study of the clump and YSO populations in NGC 2264 suggests that the\nstar formation started in the northern subregion, that it is now actively\ndeveloping at the center and will soon start in the southern subregion. Taken\ntogether, the cloud structure and the clump and YSO populations in NGC 2264\nargue for a dynamical scenario of star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 17:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

However in the NISQ\nera, the complexity and scale required to adopt even the smallest QEC is\nprohibitive. Instead, error mitigation techniques have been employed; typically\nthese do not require an increase in qubit-count but cannot provide exponential\nerror suppression. Here we show that, for the crucial case of estimating\nexpectation values of observables (key to almost all NISQ algorithms) one can\nindeed achieve an effective exponential suppression. We introduce the Error\nSuppression by Derangement (ESD) approach: by increasing the qubit count by a\nfactor of $n\\geq 2$, the error is suppressed exponentially as $Q^n$ where $Q<1$\nis a suppression factor that depends on the entropy of the errors. The ESD\napproach takes $n$ independently-prepared circuit outputs and applies a\ncontrolled derangement operator to create a state whose symmetries prevent\nerroneous states from contributing to expected values. The approach is\ntherefore `NISQ-friendly' as it is modular in the main computation and requires\nonly a shallow circuit that bridges the $n$ copies immediately prior to\nmeasurement. Imperfections in our derangement circuit do degrade performance\nand therefore we propose an approach to mitigate this effect to arbitrary\nprecision due to the remarkable properties of derangements. a) they decompose\ninto a linear number of elementary gates -- limiting the impact of noise b)\nthey are highly resilient to noise and the effect of imperfections on them is\n(almost) trivial. In numerical simulations validating our approach we confirm\nerror suppression below $10^{-6}$ for circuits consisting of several hundred\nnoisy gates (two-qubit gate error $0.5\\%$) using no more than $n=4$ circuit\ncopies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 18:00:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 18:21:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 16:06:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 13:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

It is based on an elegant design with high-level\nabstractions like parsers and match-action pipelines that can be compiled to\nefficient implementations in software or hardware. Unfortunately, like many\nindustrial languages, P4 has developed without a formal foundation. The P4\nLanguage Specification is a 160-page document with a mixture of informal prose,\ngraphical diagrams, and pseudocode. The P4 reference implementation is a\ncomplex system, running to over 40KLoC of C++ code. Clearly neither of these\nartifacts is suitable for formal reasoning.\n  This paper presents a new framework, called Petr4, that puts P4 on a solid\nfoundation. Petr4 consists of a clean-slate definitional interpreter and a\ncalculus that models the semantics of a core fragment of P4. Throughout the\nspecification, some aspects of program behavior are left up to targets. Our\ninterpreter is parameterized over a target interface which collects all the\ntarget-specific behavior in the specification in a single interface.\n  The specification makes ad-hoc restrictions on the nesting of certain program\nconstructs in order to simplify compilation and avoid the possibility of\nnonterminating programs. We captured the latter intention in our core calculus\nby stratifying its type system, rather than imposing unnatural syntactic\nrestrictions, and we proved that all programs in this core calculus terminate.\n  We have validated the interpreter against a suite of over 750 tests from the\nP4 reference implementation, exercising our target interface with tests for\ndifferent targets. We established termination for the core calculus by\ninduction on the stratified type system. While developing Petr4, we reported\ndozens of bugs in the language specification and the reference implementation,\nmany of which have been fixed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 18:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

Performing in-network\ncomputation solves both problems utilizing the computational capability of the\nindividual nodes of the network. Simultaneously, nodes communicate and share\ndata with their neighbors via message passing, which may go a long way toward\nmitigating individual nodes' privacy concerns in the network. All the\naforementioned concerns motivated us to design a decentralized or distributed\ntechnique to detect overlapped communities in a large-scale network. It is\ndesirable because this technique does not offer a single point of failure, and\nthe system as a whole can continue to function even when many of the nodes\nfail. In this paper, we address the overlapped community detection problem for\nlarge-scale networks. We present an efficient distributed algorithm, named\nDOCD, to identify the overlapped communities in the network.

This deposit is\nsimilar to features interpreted as pyroclastic deposits on the Moon and\nMercury. However, unlike previously documented lava flows in Elysium Planitia,\nthis feature is morphologically consistent with a fissure-fed pyroclastic\ndeposit, mantling the surrounding lava flows with a thickness on the order of\ntens of cm over most of the deposit and a volume of 1.1-2.8E7 cubic meters.\nThickness and volume estimates are consistent with tephra fall deposits on\nEarth.

This line of work, which started in the early 80's, culminated in a\nrecent work of Gishboliner et al., which highlighted the importance of the task\nof counting homomorphic copies of cycles (i.e., cyclic walks) in graphs of\nbounded degeneracy.\n  Our main result in this paper is a surprisingly tight relation between the\nabove task and the well-studied problem of detecting (standard) copies of\ndirected cycles in general directed graphs.

One can compute the number of homomorphic copies of $C_{2k}$ and\n$C_{2k+1}$ in $n$-vertex graphs of bounded degeneracy in time\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{d_{k}})$, where the fastest known algorithm for detecting\ndirected copies of $C_k$ in general $m$-edge digraphs runs in time\n$\\tilde{O}(m^{d_{k}})$.\n  2.

Instead, we design an algorithm for\ncomputing the number of $C_k$-homomorphisms in degenerate graphs and show that\none part of its analysis can be reduced to the analysis of the fastest known\nalgorithm for detecting directed cycles in general digraphs, which was carried\nout in a recent breakthrough of Dalirrooyfard, Vuong and Vassilevska Williams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 18:23:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 21:20:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 09:09:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 16:23:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 15:59:09 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 19:37:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}

However, there has been a range of phenomena reported\nrecently in these materials, such as the formation of low-temperature tilted\nconical and SkL states as well as temperature-induced transformations of\nlattice geometry in metastable SkL states, where anisotropy was suspected to\nplay a key role. To settle this issue on experimental basis, we quantified the\ncubic anisotropy in a series of CoZnMn-type cubic chiral magnets. We found that\nthe strength of anisotropy is highly enhanced towards low temperatures in all\nthe compounds, moreover, not only the magnitude but also the character of cubic\nanisotropy drastically varies upon changing the Co/Mn ratio. We correlate these\nchanges with temperature- and composition-induced variations of the helical\nmodulation vectors, the anharmonicity and structural rearrangements of the\nmetastable SkLs and the spin relaxation rates. Similar systematic studies on\nmagnetic anisotropy may not only pave the way for a quantitative and unified\ndescription of the stable and metastable modulated spin textures in cubic\nchiral magnets but would also help exploring further topological spin textures\nin this large class of skyrmion hosts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 18:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

Estimating the variation of intensity across the sky\ncan, therefore, play a key role in improving our understanding of astrophysical\nmodels. Skymaps have been produced for all the data-taking runs of the advanced\nground-based interferometric detectors. While these maps are being produced in\npixel and SpH bases, to probe, respectively, localized and diffuse\nastrophysical and cosmological sources, with algorithms that employ\ncross-correlation as the common strategy, the underlying algebra and numerical\nimplementation remain different. As a consequence, there was a need for\nproducing skymaps in both bases in those analyses. We show that these\nmanifestly redundant methods could indeed be unified to a single analysis that\ncan probe very different scales and demonstrate it by applying them on real\ndata. We first develop the algebra to show that the results in two different\nbases are easily transformable.

In other\nwords, we can parse complex semantic knowledge from raw video and efficiently\ntranslate that into concrete motor control. Is it possible to give a robot this\nsame capability? Prior research in robot imitation learning has created agents\nwhich can acquire diverse skills from expert human operators. However,\nexpanding these techniques to work with a single positive example during test\ntime is still an open challenge. Apart from control, the difficulty stems from\nmismatches between the demonstrator and robot domains.

Additionally, the demonstration may come from an agent with different\nmorphology and physical appearance (e.g. human), so one-to-one action\ncorrespondences are not available. This paper investigates techniques which\nallow robots to partially bridge these domain gaps, using their past\nexperience.

The process of mass accretion in the earliest phases of star\nformation is still not fully understood: Does the accretion rate smoothly\ndecline with the age of the protostar or are there short, intermittent\naccretion bursts? Aims. We aim to explore whether or not the observed C$^{18}$O\nand N$_2$H$^+$ emission pattern towards the VeLLO IRAM 04191+1522 can be\nunderstood in the framework of a scenario where the emission is chemically\ntracing a past accretion burst. Methods.We used high-angular-resolution Plateau\nde Bure Interferometer (PdBI) observations of C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ towards\nIRAM 04191+1522 that were obtained as part of the CALYPSO IRAM Large Program.\nWe model these observations using a chemical code with a time-dependent\nphysical structure coupled with a radiative transfer module, where we allow for\nvariations in the source luminosity. Results. We find that the N$_2$H$^+$ line\nemission shows a central hole, while the C$^{18}$O emission is compact. The\nmorphology of these two lines cannot be reproduced with a constant luminosity\nmodel based on the present-day internal luminosity (0.08 L$_{sun}$). However,\nthe N$_2$H$^+$ peaks are consistent with a constant-luminosity model of 12\nL$_{sun}$. Using a model with time-dependent temperature and density profiles,\nwe show that the observed N$_2$H$^+$ peak emission could indeed be caused by a\npast accretion burst. Such a burst should have occurred a couple of hundred\nyears ago. Conclusions. We suggest that an accretion burst occurred in IRAM\n04191+1522 in the recent past. If such bursts are common and sufficiently long\nin VeLLOs, they could lead to higher accretion onto the central object than\ntheir luminosity suggests. For IRAM 04191 in particular, our results yield an\nestimated final mass of 0.2 - 0.25 M$_{sun}$ by the end of the Class 0 phase,\nwhich would make this object a low-mass star rather than a brown dwarf.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 18:51:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 08:35:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

Unfortunately, there are two challenges to\novercome to utilize that information. First, we do not know the optimal\nestimator that will allow us to retrieve the maximum information. Second,\nbaryonic effects impact that regime significantly and in a poorly understood\nmanner. Ideally, we would like to use an estimator that extracts the maximum\ncosmological information while marginalizing over baryonic effects. In this\nwork we show that neural networks can achieve that. We made use of data where\nthe maximum amount of cosmological information is known: power spectra and 2D\nGaussian density fields. We also contaminate the data with simplified baryonic\neffects and train neural networks to predict the value of the cosmological\nparameters. For this data, we show that neural networks can 1) extract the\nmaximum available cosmological information, 2) marginalize over baryonic\neffects, and 3) extract cosmological information that is buried in the regime\ndominated by baryonic physics. We also show that neural networks learn the\npriors of the data they are trained on.

A\ncurrent potential limitation of time delay distance measurements is the\n\"mass-sheet transformation\" (MST) which leaves the lensed imaging unchanged but\nchanges the distance measurements and the derived value of $H_0$. In this work\nwe show that the standard method of addressing the MST in time delay\ncosmography, through a combination of high-resolution imaging and the\nmeasurement of the stellar velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy, depends\non the assumption that the ratio, $D_{\\rm s}/D_{\\rm ds}$, of angular diameter\ndistances to the background quasar and between the lensing galaxy and the\nquasar can be constrained.

ACE is crucial for maintaining\nthe safety of the rover, but is computationally expensive. If the most\npromising candidates in the list of paths are all found to be infeasible, ENav\nmust continue to search the list and run time-consuming ACE evaluations until a\nfeasible path is found. In this paper, we present two heuristics that, given a\nterrain heightmap around the rover, produce cost estimates that more\neffectively rank the candidate paths before ACE evaluation. The first heuristic\nuses Sobel operators and convolution to incorporate the cost of traversing\nhigh-gradient terrain. The second heuristic uses a machine learning (ML) model\nto predict areas that will be deemed untraversable by ACE. We used physics\nsimulations to collect training data for the ML model and to run Monte Carlo\ntrials to quantify navigation performance across a variety of terrains with\nvarious slopes and rock distributions. Compared to ENav's baseline performance,\nintegrating the heuristics can lead to a significant reduction in ACE\nevaluations and average computation time per planning cycle, increase path\nefficiency, and maintain or improve the rate of successful traverses. This\nstrategy of targeting specific bottlenecks with ML while maintaining the\noriginal ACE safety checks provides an example of how ML can be infused into\nplanetary science missions and other safety-critical software.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 19:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

Gibbs sampling\nbreaks the computationally heavy destriping problem into two separate steps;\nnoise filtering and map binning. Considered as two separate steps, both are\ncomputationally much cheaper than solving the combined problem. This provides a\nhuge performance benefit as compared to traditional methods, and allows us for\nthe first time to bring the destriping baseline length to a single sample. We\napply the Gibbs procedure to simulated Planck 30 GHz data. We find that gaps in\nthe time-ordered data are handled efficiently by filling them with simulated\nnoise as part of the Gibbs process. The Gibbs procedure yields a chain of map\nsamples, from which we may compute the posterior mean as a best-estimate map.\nThe variation in the chain provides information on the correlated residual\nnoise, without need to construct a full noise covariance matrix. However, if\nonly a single maximum-likelihood frequency map estimate is required, we find\nthat traditional conjugate gradient solvers converge much faster than a Gibbs\nsampler in terms of total number of iterations. The conceptual advantages of\nthe Gibbs sampling approach lies in statistically well-defined error\npropagation and systematic error correction, and this methodology forms the\nconceptual basis for the map-making algorithm employed in the BeyondPlanck\nframework, which implements the first end-to-end Bayesian analysis pipeline for\nCMB observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 19:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

As per the WHO's $Wilson-Jungner$ criteria, one of the prerequisite\nsteps before undertaking screening is to ensure that a treatment for the\ncondition screened exists. However, in so doing, a paradox, henceforth termed\nthe screening paradox, ensues. If a disease process is screened for and\nsubsequently treated, its prevalence would drop in the population, which as per\nBayes' theorem, would make the tests' predictive value drop in return. Put\nanother way, a very powerful screening test would, by performing and succeeding\nat the very task it was developed to do, paradoxically reduce its ability to\ncorrectly identify individuals with the disease it screens for in the future.\nWhere $J$ is Youden's statistic (sensitivity [$a$] + specificity [$b$] - 1),\nand $\\phi$ is the prevalence, the ratio of positive predictive values at\nsubsequent time $k$, $\\rho(\\phi_{k})$, over the original $\\rho(\\phi_{0})$ at\n$t_0$ is given by:\n  $\\zeta(\\phi_{0},k) = \\frac{\\rho(\\phi_{k})}{\\rho(\\phi_{0})}\n=\\frac{\\phi_k(1-b)+J\\phi_0\\phi_k}{\\phi_0(1-b)+J\\phi_0\\phi_k}$\n  In this manuscript, we explore the mathematical model which formalizes said\nscreening paradox and explore its implications for population level screening\nprograms.

In\nsuch methods, it is well known that due to the neglect of electron-proton\ncorrelation, a Hartree-Fock (HF) description of the electron-proton interaction\ncatastrophically fails leading to qualitatively incorrect protonic properties.\nIn single-component quantum chemistry, the qualitative failure of HF is\nnormally indicative of the need for multireference methods such as complete\nactive space self-consistent field (CASSCF). While a multicomponent CASSCF\nmethod was implemented nearly twenty years ago, it is only able to perform\ncalculations with very small active spaces (~105 multicomponent\nconfigurations). Therefore, in order to extend the realm of applicability of\nthe multicomponent CASSCF method, this study derives and implements a new\ntwo-step multicomponent CASSCF method that uses multicomponent heat-bath\nconfiguration interaction for the configuration interaction step, enabling\ncalculations with very large active spaces (up to 16 electrons in 48 orbitals).\nWe find that large electronic active spaces are needed to obtain qualitatively\naccurate protonic densities for the HCN and FHF- molecules.

There are theoretical\nresults on the ability to detect if a population of data is likely to come from\na known base distribution, which is known as the goodness-of-fit problem.\nOne-sample approaches to this problem offer significant computational\nadvantages for online testing, but require knowing a model of the base\ndistribution. The ability to correctly reject anomalous data in this setting\nhinges on the accuracy of the model of the base distribution. For high\ndimensional data, learning an accurate-enough model of the base distribution\nsuch that anomaly detection works reliably is very challenging, as many\nresearchers have noted in recent years. Existing methods for the one-sample\ngoodness-of-fit problem do not account for the fact that a model of the base\ndistribution is learned. To address that gap, we offer a theoretically\nmotivated approach to account for the density learning procedure. In\nparticular, we propose training an ensemble of density models, considering data\nto be anomalous if the data is anomalous with respect to any member of the\nensemble. We provide a theoretical justification for this approach, proving\nfirst that a test on typicality is a valid approach to the goodness-of-fit\nproblem, and then proving that for a correctly constructed ensemble of models,\nthe intersection of typical sets of the models lies in the interior of the\ntypical set of the base distribution.

Weakly\nsymmetric Riemannian manifolds are geodesic orbit spaces. Here we define\n\"naturally reductive\" for pseudo-Riemannian manifolds and note that they are\ngeodesic orbit spaces. A few years ago two of the authors proved that weakly\nsymmetric pseudo-Riemannian manifolds are geodesic orbit spaces. In particular\nthese results apply to pseudo-Riemannian Lorentz manifolds. There our main\nresults are Theorems 4.2 and 5.1. In the Riemannian case the nilpotent isometry\ngroup for a geodesic orbit nilmanifold is abelian or $2$-step nilpotent.\nExamples show that this fails dramatically in the pseudo-Riemannian case.

A prominent model for studying\nsuch interactions is reservoir computing, where learning acts on\nlow-dimensional bottlenecks. Despite the simplicity of this learning scheme,\nthe factors contributing to or hindering the success of training in reservoir\nnetworks are in general not well understood. In this work, we study non-linear\nfeedback networks trained to generate a sinusoidal signal, and analyze how\nlearning performance is shaped by the interplay between internal network\ndynamics and target properties. By performing exact mathematical analysis of\nlinearized networks, we predict that learning performance is maximized when the\ntarget is characterized by an optimal, intermediate frequency which\nmonotonically decreases with the strength of the internal reservoir\nconnectivity. At the optimal frequency, the reservoir representation of the\ntarget signal is high-dimensional, de-synchronized, and thus maximally robust\nto noise. We show that our predictions successfully capture the qualitative\nbehaviour of performance in non-linear networks. Moreover, we find that the\nrelationship between internal representations and performance can be further\nexploited in trained non-linear networks to explain behaviours which do not\nhave a linear counterpart. Our results indicate that a major determinant of\nlearning success is the quality of the internal representation of the target,\nwhich in turn is shaped by an interplay between parameters controlling the\ninternal network and those defining the task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 20:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

Images of 9--s cadence are used\nto analyze the event over a 120-minute period, and solar emission is observed\nout to a distance of $\\approx3.5\\,R_\\odot$, with an instantaneous bandwidth\ncovering 22~MHz within the frequency range of 40--70~MHz. We present our\nresults from the investigation of the radio event, focusing particularly on one\nburst source that exhibits outward motion, which we classify as a moving type\nIV burst. We image the event at multiple frequencies and use the source\ncentroids to obtain the velocity for the outward motion. Spatial and temporal\ncomparison with observations of the CME in white light from the LASCO(C2)\ncoronagraph, indicates an association of the outward motion with the core of\nthe CME. By performing graduated-cylindrical-shell (GCS) reconstruction of the\nCME, we constrain the density in the volume. The electron plasma frequency\nobtained from the density estimates do not allow us to completely dismiss\nplasma emission as the underlying mechanism. However, based on source height\nand smoothness of the emission in frequency and time, we argue that\ngyrosynchrotron is the more plausible mechanism. We use gyrosynchrotron\nspectral fitting techniques to estimate the evolving physical conditions during\nthe outward motion of this burst source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 21:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

We study the dynamics of a hepatitis C\nvirus (HCV) model, under therapy, that considers both extracellular and\nintracellular levels of infection. At present most mathematical modeling of\nviral kinetics after treatment only addresses the process of infection of a\ncell by the virus and the release of virions by the cell, while the processes\ntaking place inside the cell are not included. We prove that the solutions of\nthe new model with positive initial values are positive, exist globally in time\nand are bounded. The model has two virus-free steady states. They are\ndistinguished by the fact that viral RNA is absent inside the cells in the\nfirst state and present inside the cells in the second. There are basic\nreproduction numbers associated to each of these steady states. If the basic\nreproduction number of the first steady state is less than one then that state\nis asymptotically stable. If the basic reproduction number of the first steady\nstate is greater than one and that of the second less than one then the second\nsteady state is asymptotically stable. If both basic reproduction numbers are\ngreater than one then we obtain various conclusions which depend on different\nrestrictions on the parameters of the model. Under increasingly strong\nassumptions we prove that there is at least one positive steady state (infected\nequilibrium), that there is a unique positive steady state and that the\npositive steady state is stable. We also give a condition under which every\npositive solution converges to a positive steady state. This is proved by\nmethods of Li and Muldowney.

Often, it is natural and desirable to require that these\nstructures have small hop length or hop diameter. Unfortunately, optimization\nproblems with hop constraints are much harder and less well understood than\ntheir hop-unconstrained counterparts. A significant algorithmic barrier in this\nsetting is the fact that hop-constrained distances in graphs are very far from\nbeing a metric.\n  We show that, nonetheless, hop-constrained distances can be approximated by\ndistributions over \"partial tree metrics.\" We build this result into a powerful\nand versatile algorithmic tool which, similarly to classic probabilistic tree\nembeddings, reduces hop-constrained problems in general graphs to\nhop-unconstrained problems on trees. We then use this tool to give the first\npoly-logarithmic bicriteria approximations for the hop-constrained variants of\nmany classic network design problems. These include Steiner forest, group\nSteiner tree, group Steiner forest, buy-at-bulk network design as well as\nonline and oblivious versions of many of these problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 23:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

Scheduling with\nincompatibilities between jobs represents a well-established line of research\nin scheduling theory and the case of disjoint cliques has received increasing\nattention in recent years.

Recently, both supervised and unsupervised\npre-training approaches to learning representations have achieved remarkable\nadvances, which exploit the discriminative knowledge of labels and the\nintrinsic structure of data, respectively. It follows natural intuition that\nboth discriminative knowledge and intrinsic structure of the downstream task\ncan be useful for fine-tuning, however, existing fine-tuning methods mainly\nleverage the former and discard the latter. A question arises: How to fully\nexplore the intrinsic structure of data for boosting fine-tuning? In this\npaper, we propose Bi-tuning, a general learning framework to fine-tuning both\nsupervised and unsupervised pre-trained representations to downstream tasks.\nBi-tuning generalizes the vanilla fine-tuning by integrating two heads upon the\nbackbone of pre-trained representations: a classifier head with an improved\ncontrastive cross-entropy loss to better leverage the label information in an\ninstance-contrast way, and a projector head with a newly-designed categorical\ncontrastive learning loss to fully exploit the intrinsic structure of data in a\ncategory-consistent way. Comprehensive experiments confirm that Bi-tuning\nachieves state-of-the-art results for fine-tuning tasks of both supervised and\nunsupervised pre-trained models by large margins (e.g. 10.7\\% absolute rise in\naccuracy on CUB in low-data regime).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 03:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

Simply, domain adaptation methods\ncan access data from unseen domains during training; whereas in domain\ngeneralization, the unseen data is not available during training. Hence, domain\ngeneralization concerns models that perform well on inaccessible,\ndomain-shifted data. Method: Our proposed domain generalization method\nrepresents an unseen domain using a set of known basis domains, afterwhich we\nclassify the unseen domain using classifier fusion. To demonstrate our system,\nwe employ a collection of heart sound databases that contain normal and\nabnormal sounds (classes). Results: Our proposed classifier fusion method\nachieves accuracy gains of up to 16% for four completely unseen domains.\nConclusion: Recognizing the complexity induced by the inherent temporal nature\nof biosignal data, the two-stage method proposed in this study is able to\neffectively simplify the whole process of domain generalization while\ndemonstrating good results on unseen domains and the adopted basis domains.\nSignificance: To our best knowledge, this is the first study that investigates\ndomain generalization for biosignal data.

When a deep network continually learns over time by\naccommodating new tasks, it usually quickly overwrites the knowledge learned\nfrom previous tasks. Referred to as the {\\it neural variability}, it is\nwell-known in neuroscience that human brain reactions exhibit substantial\nvariability even in response to the same stimulus. This mechanism balances\naccuracy and plasticity/flexibility in the motor learning of natural nervous\nsystems. Thus it motivates us to design a similar mechanism named {\\it\nartificial neural variability} (ANV), which helps artificial neural networks\nlearn some advantages from ``natural'' neural networks. We rigorously prove\nthat ANV plays as an implicit regularizer of the mutual information between the\ntraining data and the learned model.

CodedFedL enables coded computing for\nnon-linear federated learning by efficiently exploiting distributed kernel\nembedding via random Fourier features that transforms the training task into\ncomputationally favourable distributed linear regression. Furthermore, clients\ngenerate local parity datasets by coding over their local datasets, while the\nserver combines them to obtain the global parity dataset. Gradient from the\nglobal parity dataset compensates for straggling gradients during training, and\nthereby speeds up convergence. For minimizing the epoch deadline time at the\nMEC server, we provide a tractable approach for finding the amount of coding\nredundancy and the number of local data points that a client processes during\ntraining, by exploiting the statistical properties of compute as well as\ncommunication delays. We also characterize the leakage in data privacy when\nclients share their local parity datasets with the server. We analyze the\nconvergence rate and iteration complexity of CodedFedL under simplifying\nassumptions, by treating CodedFedL as a stochastic gradient descent algorithm.\nFurthermore, we conduct numerical experiments using practical network\nparameters and benchmark datasets, where CodedFedL speeds up the overall\ntraining time by up to $15\\times$ in comparison to the benchmark schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 06:21:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 May 2021 19:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

In the relation to Perelman's theory of the Ricci\nflow, the role of Perelman's dilaton is played by our nonprojectable lapse.\nHere we demonstrate that this construction is equivalent to a standard one-step\nBRST gauge-fixing of a theory whose fields are $g_{ij}$, $n^i$ and $n$, and\nwhose gauge symmetries consist of (i) the topological deformations of $g_{ij}$,\nand (ii) the ultralocal nonrelativistic limit of spacetime diffeomorphisms.

However, such a step-wise application of pruning\nand quantization may lead to suboptimal solutions and unnecessary time\nconsumption. In this paper, we tackle this issue by integrating network pruning\nand quantization as a unified joint compression problem and then use AutoML to\nautomatically solve it. We find the pruning process can be regarded as the\nchannel-wise quantization with 0 bit. Thus, the separate two-step pruning and\nquantization can be simplified as the one-step quantization with mixed\nprecision. This unification not only simplifies the compression pipeline but\nalso avoids the compression divergence. To implement this idea, we propose the\nautomated model compression by jointly applied pruning and quantization (AJPQ).\nAJPQ is designed with a hierarchical architecture: the layer controller\ncontrols the layer sparsity, and the channel controller decides the bit-width\nfor each kernel. Following the same importance criterion, the layer controller\nand the channel controller collaboratively decide the compression strategy.\nWith the help of reinforcement learning, our one-step compression is\nautomatically achieved. Compared with the state-of-the-art automated\ncompression methods, our method obtains a better accuracy while reducing the\nstorage considerably. For fixed precision quantization, AJPQ can reduce more\nthan five times model size and two times computation with a slight performance\nincrease for Skynet in remote sensing object detection. When mixed-precision is\nallowed, AJPQ can reduce five times model size with only 1.06% top-5 accuracy\ndecline for MobileNet in the classification task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 07:06:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

In this paper, we apply a threat analysis on the web\npassword login process, and uncover a design vulnerability in the\nHTML<inputtype=\"password\"> field.

The plasma is characterised by five variables:\nthe electron and ion magnetisations, the squared electron and ion sound speeds,\nand a parameter describing the angle between the propagation vector and the\nmagnetic field. The dispersion relation describes 6 pairs of waves which we\nlabel S, A, F, M, O, and X. Varying the angle, it is argued that parallel and\nperpendicular propagation (with respect to the magnetic field) exhibit unique\nbehaviour. This behaviour is characterised by the crossing of wave modes which\nis prohibited at oblique angles. We identify up to 6 different parameter\nregimes where a varying number of exact mode crossings in the special parallel\nor perpendicular orientations can occur. We point out how any ion-electron\nplasma has a critical magnetisation (or electron cyclotron frequency) at which\nthe cutoff ordering changes, leading to different crossing behaviour. These are\nrelevant for exotic plasma conditions found in pulsar and magnetar\nenvironments. Our discussion is fully consistent with ideal relativistic MHD\nand contains light waves. Additionally, exploiting the general nature of the\ndispersion relation, phase and group speed diagrams can be computed at\narbitrary wavelengths for any parameter regime.

I set up a\nbaseline scenario based on the German containment policies and fit the\nepidemiological parameters of the simulation to the observed German death curve\nand an estimated infection curve of the first COVID-19 wave. My model suggests\nthat by acting one week later, the death toll of the first wave in Germany\nwould have been 180% higher, whereas it would have been 60% lower, if the\npolicies had been enacted a week earlier.

This\nsimplifies and complements the results of arXiv:1910.14608, which are based on\nQuillen's rational homotopy theory.\n  According to Sullivan, the rational homotopy type of a nilpotent space $X$\nwith finite Betti numbers is completely determined by a commutative\ndifferential graded algebra $A$ modelling the cup product on rational\ncohomology. In this article we extend this correspondence between topology and\nalgebra to parametrised stable homotopy theory: for a space $X$ corresponding\nto the cdga $A$, we prove an equivalence between specific rational homotopy\ncategories for parametrised spectra over $X$ and for differential graded\n$A$-modules. While not full, the rational homotopy categories we consider\ncontain a large class of parametrised spectra. The simplicity of the approach\nthat we develop enables direct calculations in parametrised stable homotopy\ntheory using differential graded modules.\n  To illustrate the usefulness of our approach, we build a comprehensive\ndictionary of algebraic translations of topological constructions; providing\nalgebraic models for base change functors, fibrewise stabilisations,\nparametrised Postnikov sections, fibrewise smash products, and complexes of\nfibrewise stable maps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 10:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

In this type of highly\nimbalanced classification problems, which encompass complex features, deep\nlearning (DL) is much needed because of its strong detection capabilities. At\nthe same time, DL is observed in practice to favor majority over minority\nclasses and consequently suffer from inaccurate detection of the targeted\nearly-stage indications. To simulate such scenarios, we artificially generate\nskewness (99% vs. 1%) for certain plant types out of the PlantVillage dataset\nas a basis for classification of scarce visual cues through transfer learning.\nBy randomly and unevenly picking healthy and unhealthy samples from certain\nplant types to form a training set, we consider a base experiment as\nfine-tuning ResNet34 and VGG19 architectures and then testing the model\nperformance on a balanced dataset of healthy and unhealthy images.

Specifically, we assume\nthat the domains of these unknown values are finite and, for a Boolean query\n$q$, we consider the following two problems: given as input an incomplete\ndatabase $D$, (a) return the number of completions of $D$ that satisfy $q$; or\n(b) return the number of valuations of the nulls of $D$ yielding a completion\nthat satisfies $q$. We obtain dichotomies between \\#P-hardness and\npolynomial-time computability for these problems when $q$ is a self-join-free\nconjunctive query, and study the impact on the complexity of the following two\nrestrictions: (1) every null occurs at most once in $D$ (what is called Codd\ntables); and (2) the domain of each null is the same. Roughly speaking, we show\nthat counting completions is much harder than counting valuations: for\ninstance, while the latter is always in \\#P, we prove that the former is not in\n\\#P under some widely believed theoretical complexity assumption. Moreover, we\nfind that both (1) and (2) can reduce the complexity of our problems. We also\nstudy the approximability of these problems and show that, while counting\nvaluations always has a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme\n(FPRAS), in most cases counting completions does not.

In this paper we propose a novel Memetic\nAlgorithm with efficient local search and extended neighborhood, dubbed MATE,\nto solve this problem. Compared to existing algorithms, the advantages of MATE\nlie in two aspects. First, it is capable of more effectively exploring the\nsearch space, due to its novel initialization procedure, crossover and\nlarge-step-size operators. Second, it is also more efficient in local\nexploitation, due to its sophisticated constant-time-complexity move evaluation\nmechanism. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that MATE outperforms\nall the state-of-the-art algorithms, and notably, finds new best-known\nsolutions on 12 instances (65 instances in total). Moreover, a comprehensive\nablation study is also conducted to show the effectiveness of the novel\ncomponents integrated in MATE.

Although these approaches have shown high performance\nand reduced computational complexity compared to classical methods, most of\nthem require supervised training using paired artifact-free and\nartifact-corrupted images, which may prohibit its use in many important\nclinical applications. For example, transient severe motion (TSM) due to acute\ntransient dyspnea in Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR is difficult to control and model\nfor paired data generation. To address this issue, here we propose a novel\nunsupervised deep learning scheme through outlier-rejecting bootstrap\nsubsampling and aggregation. This is inspired by the observation that motions\nusually cause sparse k-space outliers in the phase encoding direction, so\nk-space subsampling along the phase encoding direction can remove some outliers\nand the aggregation step can further improve the results from the\nreconstruction network. Our method does not require any paired data because the\ntraining step only requires artifact-free images. Furthermore, to address the\nsmoothing from potential bias to the artifact-free images, the network is\ntrained in an unsupervised manner using optimal transport driven cycleGAN. We\nverify that our method can be applied for artifact correction from simulated\nmotion as well as real motion from TSM successfully, outperforming existing\nstate-of-the-art deep learning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 12:10:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

Frequently, the driving force\nof the instability mechanisms has a chemo-mechanical nature which makes these\nkind of instabilities very different from standard elastic instabilities. In\nthis paper, we describe and study the active-elastic instability occurring in a\nswollen spherical closed shell, bounding a water filled cavity, during a\nde-hydration process. The description is given through the outcomes of a few\nnumerical experiments based on a stress-diffusion model which allows to glance\nat the phenomenon. The study is carried on from a chemo-mechanical perspective\nthrough a few simplifying assumptions which allow to derive a semi-analytical\nmodel which takes into account both the stress state and the water\nconcentration into the walls of the shell at the onset of the instability.\nMoreover, also the invariance of the cavity volume at the onset of instability,\nwhich is due to the impossibility to instantaneously change the cavity volume\nfilled with water, is considered. It is shown as the semi-analytic model\nmatches very well the outcome of the numerical experiments. It is also shown as\na wider range of mechanical instabilities can be produced when inhomogeneous\nshells are considered, even when the inhomogeneities can be described by a\nsmall number of parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 12:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

Many measures have thus been proposed to date, and these\nmeasures are either based on the locality of nodes or the global nature of the\nnetwork. These measures typically use distance based on the concept of\ntraditional Euclidean Distance, which only focus on the local static geographic\ndistance between nodes but ignore the interaction between nodes in real-world\nnetworks. However, a variety of factors should be considered for the purpose of\nidentifying influential nodes, such as degree, edge, direction and weight. Some\nmethods based on evidence theory have also been proposed. In this paper, we\nhave proposed an original and novel gravity model with effective distance for\nidentifying influential nodes based on information fusion and multi-level\nprocessing. Our method is able to comprehensively consider the global and local\ninformation of the complex network, and also utilize the effective distance to\nreplace the Euclidean Distance.

The presented results provide guidelines for achieving structures with\nimproved electronic couplings.

Emission from 26Al and\nfrom 60Fe decay lines originates from accumulated ejecta of nucleosynthesis\nsources, and appears diffuse in nature. 26Al and 60Fe are believed to originate\nmostly from massive star clusters. Gamma-ray observations open an interesting\nwindow to trace the fate and flow of nucleosynthesis ejecta, after they have\nleft the immediate sources and their birth sites, and on their path to mix with\nambient interstellar gas. The INTEGRAL 26Al emission image confirms earlier\nfindings of clumpiness and an extent along the entire plane of the Galaxy,\nsupporting its origin from massive-star groups. INTEGRAL spectroscopy resolved\nthe line and found Doppler broadenings and systematic shifts from large-scale\ngalactic rotation. But an excess velocity of ~200 km/s suggests that 26Al\ndecays preferentially within large superbubbles that extend in forward\ndirections between spiral arms. The detection of 26Al line emission from nearby\nOrion and the Eridanus superbubble supports this interpretation. Positrons from\nbeta+ decays of 26Al and other nucleosynthesis ejecta have been found to not\nexplain the morphology of positron annihilation gamma-rays at 511 keV that have\nbeen measured by INTEGRAL. The 60Fe signal measured by INTEGRAL is diffuse but\ntoo weak for an imaging interpretation, an origin from point-like/concentrated\nsources is excluded. The 60Fe/26Al ratio is constrained to a range 0.2-0.4.\nBeyond improving precision of these results, diffuse nucleosynthesis\ncontributions from novae (through 22Na radioactivity) and from past neutron\nstar mergers in our Galaxy (from r-process radioactivity) are exciting new\nprospects for the remaining mission extensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 13:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

A new observer, referred to as Extended Dynamics\nObserver (EDO), is proposed to estimate both the state and disturbance\nsimultaneously. The working mechanism of EDO consists of two parts: The\ndisturbance with known dynamics is canceled completely by its dynamics and the\ndisturbance with unknown dynamics is absorbed by high-gain. It is found that\nthe high-gain is always working as long as the control plant with unknown input\ndisturbance is observable which is the only assumption for the observer design.\nWhen the disturbance dynamics are completely unknown except some boundedness,\nthe EDO is reduced to an extension of the well-known extended state observer or\nhigh-gain observer. The main advantage of the developed method is that the\nprior information about both the control plant and the disturbance can be\nutilized as much as possible. The more the prior information we have, the\nbetter performance the observer would be.

Intelligent behavior is related to these limitations, since\nresource constraints drive the need to generalize and assign importance\ndifferentially to features in the environment or memories of past experiences.\nRecently, there have been parallel efforts in reinforcement learning and\nneuroscience to understand strategies adopted by artificial and biological\nagents to circumvent limitations in information storage. However, the two\nthreads have been largely separate. In this article, we propose a dynamical\nframework to maximize expected reward under constraints of limited resources,\nwhich we implement with a cost function that penalizes precise representations\nof action-values in memory, each of which may vary in its precision. We derive\nfrom first principles an algorithm, Dynamic Resource Allocator (DRA), which we\napply to two standard tasks in reinforcement learning and a model-based\nplanning task, and find that it allocates more resources to items in memory\nthat have a higher impact on cumulative rewards. Moreover, DRA learns faster\nwhen starting with a higher resource budget than what it eventually allocates\nfor performing well on tasks, which may explain why frontal cortical areas in\nbiological brains appear more engaged in early stages of learning before\nsettling to lower asymptotic levels of activity.

However, there are no studies that\nderive the distribution with considering the following conditions: (1)\nevolution of the coronal loop plasma heated by small-scale flares, (2) loops\nsmaller than the spatial resolution of the observed image, and (3)\nmultiwavelength observation. To take into account these conditions, we\nintroduce a new method to analyze small-scale flares statistically based on a\none-dimensional loop simulation and a machine learning technique, that is,\ngenetic algorithm. First, we obtain six channels of SDO/AIA light curves of the\nactive-region coronal loops. Second, we carry out many coronal loop simulations\nand obtain the SDO/AIA light curves for each simulation in a pseudo-manner.\nThird, using the genetic algorithm, we estimate the best combination of\nsimulated light curves that reproduce the observation. Consequently, the\nobserved coronal loops are heated by small-scale flares with energy flux larger\nthan that typically required to heat up an active region intermittently.\nMoreover, we derive the occurrence frequency distribution which have various\npower-law indices in the range from 1 to 3, which partially supports the\nnanoflare heating model.

The Dirac equation with an invariant metric is shown to be\nequivalent to a system of equations on a Lie group of transformations of a\nhomogeneous space. This allows us to effectively apply the noncommutative\nintegration method of linear partial differential equations on Lie groups. This\nmethod differs from the well-known method of separation of variables and to\nsome extent can often supplement it. The general structure of the method\ndeveloped is illustrated with an example of a homogeneous space which does not\nadmit separation of variables in the Dirac equation. However, the basis of\nexact solutions to the Dirac equation is constructed explicitly by the\nnoncommutative integration method. Also, we construct a complete set of new\nexact solutions to the Dirac equation in the three-dimensional de Sitter\nspace-time $\\mathrm{AdS_{3}}$ using the method developed.

We identify program discontinuity as a common theme in\nexisting \\emph{ad hoc} definitions and introduce an alternative notion of\naccuracy parametrized by, what we call, {\\distance} -- the {\\distance} of an\ninput $x$ w.r.t., a deterministic computation $f$ and a distance $d$, is the\nminimal distance $d(x,y)$ over all $y$ such that $f(y)\\neq f(x)$.

Though justification in favor of each\nexists, we argue that open-source algorithm development should be the standard\nin highly consequential contexts that affect people's lives for reasons of\ntransparency and collaboration, which contribute to greater predictive accuracy\nand enjoy the additional advantage of cost-effectiveness. To make this case, we\nfocus on criminal sentencing algorithms, as criminal sentencing is highly\nconsequential, and impacts society and individual people. Further, the\npopularity of this topic has surged in the wake of recent studies uncovering\nracial bias in proprietary sentencing algorithms among other issues of\nover-fitting and model complexity. We suggest these issues are exacerbated by\nthe proprietary and expensive nature of virtually all widely used criminal\nsentencing algorithms. Upon replicating a major algorithm using real criminal\nprofiles, we fit three penalized regressions and demonstrate an increase in\npredictive power of these open-source and relatively computationally\ninexpensive options. The result is a data-driven suggestion that if judges who\nare making sentencing decisions want to craft appropriate sentences based on a\nhigh degree of accuracy and at low costs, then they should be pursuing\nopen-source options.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 14:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

Rolling shutter LiDARs are particularly common, in\nwhich an array of lasers scans the scene from a rotating base. Points are\nemitted as a stream of packets, each covering a sector of the 360{\\deg}\ncoverage. Modern perception algorithms wait for the full sweep to be built\nbefore processing the data, which introduces an additional latency. For typical\n10Hz LiDARs this will be 100ms. As a consequence, by the time an output is\nproduced, it no longer accurately reflects the state of the world. This poses a\nchallenge, as robotics applications require minimal reaction times, such that\nmaneuvers can be quickly planned in the event of a safety-critical situation.\nIn this paper we propose StrObe, a novel approach that minimizes latency by\ningesting LiDAR packets and emitting a stream of detections without waiting for\nthe full sweep to be built.

We analyse time-series of sixteen solar active regions\nand a statistically significant sample of 9454 point-in-time observations\ncorresponding to hundreds of regions observed during solar cycle 24. The\ntime-series analysis shows that the temporal derivatives of the Emission\nMeasure dEM/dt and the maximum DEM temperature dTmax/dt frequently exhibit high\npositive values a few hours before M- and X-class flares, indicating that\nflaring regions become brighter and hotter as the flare onset approaches. From\nthe point-in-time observations we compute the conditional probabilities of\nflare occurrences using the distributions of positive values of the dEM/dt, and\ndTmax/dt and compare them with corresponding flaring probabilities of the total\nunsigned magnetic flux, a conventionally used, standard flare predictor.

Although the one-zone leptonic models\nare generally successful in explaining the multi-wave band emission, they are\nproblematic in reproducing the radio spectrum. In the study of Mrk 421,\none-zone models suggest that in order to avoid overproducing the radio flux,\nthe minimum electron Lorentz factor should be larger than a few hundred at\nleast, even considering the synchrotron self-absorption effect. This result\nsuggests that the model predicted spectral index in the radio band of Mrk 421\nshould be -1/3. On the basis of this result, by assuming there is a neglected\nregion that will also contribute the radio emission and its electron energy\nindex is naturally originate from the simplest first-order Fermi acceleration\nmechanism, we can get a superimposed flat radio spectrum.

For many of these applications, the\nidentification approach of Ahlswede and Dueck is much more efficient than the\nclassical message transmission scheme proposed by Shannon. Previous studies\nconcentrate mainly on identification over discrete channels. For discrete\nchannels, it was proved that identification is robust under channels\nuncertainty. Furthermore, optimal identification schemes that are secure and\nrobust against jamming attacks have been considered. However, no results for\ncontinuous channels have yet been established. That is why we focus on the\ncontinuous case: the Gaussian channel for its known practical relevance. We\ndeal with secure identification over Gaussian channels. Provable secure\ncommunication is of a high interest for future communication systems. A key\ntechnique for implementing secure communication is the physical layer security\nbased on information theoretic security. We model this with the wiretap\nchannel. In particular, we provide a suitable coding scheme for the Gaussian\nwiretap channel (GWC) and determine the corresponding secure identification\ncapacity. We also consider Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Gaussian\nchannels and provide an efficient signal-processing scheme.

We present a\ngeneral framework for mixture models, when the prior of the `cluster centres'\nis a finite repulsive point process depending on a hyperparameter, specified by\na density which may depend on an intractable normalizing constant. By\ninvestigating the posterior characterization of this class of mixture models,\nwe derive a MCMC algorithm which avoids the well-known difficulties associated\nto reversible jump MCMC computation. In particular, we use an ancillary\nvariable method, which eliminates the problem of having intractable normalizing\nconstants in the Hastings ratio. The ancillary variable method relies on a\nperfect simulation algorithm, and we demonstrate this is fast because the\nnumber of components is typically small.

A natural requirement for MLaaS is, however, to provide highly\naccurate prediction services. To achieve this, current MLaaS systems integrate\nand combine multiple well-trained models in their services. Yet, in reality,\nthere is no easy way for MLaaS providers, especially for startups, to collect\nsufficiently well-trained models from individual developers, due to the lack of\nincentives. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by building up a model\nmarketplace, called as Golden Grain, to facilitate model sharing, which\nenforces the fair model-money swapping process between individual developers\nand MLaaS providers.

And what features\nmake one network more compressible than another? Here we answer these questions\nby modeling networks as information sources before compressing them using\nrate-distortion theory. Each network yields a unique rate-distortion curve,\nwhich specifies the minimal amount of information that remains at a given scale\nof description. A natural definition then emerges for the compressibility of a\nnetwork: the amount of information that can be removed via compression,\naveraged across all scales.

These results indicate\nthat hierarchical organization -- which is characterized by modular structure\nand heterogeneous degrees -- facilitates compression in complex networks.\nGenerally, our framework sheds light on the interplay between a network's\nstructure and its capacity to be compressed, enabling investigations into the\nrole of compression in shaping real-world networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 19:46:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 16:42:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 19:57:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

H. Hardy, \"the\nhuman function is to 'discover or observe' mathematics\" (1). For centuries,\nstarting from the ancient Greeks, mankind has hunted for beauty and order in\narts and in nature. This quest for mathematical beauty has led to the discovery\nof recurrent mathematical structures, such as the golden ratio, Fibonacci, and\nLucas numbers, whose ubiquitous presences have been tantalizing the minds of\nartists and scientists alike. The captivation for this quest comes with high\nstakes. In fact, art is the definitive expression of human creativity, and its\nmathematical understanding would deliver us the keys for decoding human culture\nand its evolution (2). However, it was not until fairly recently that the scope\nand the scale of the human quest for mathematical beauty was radically expanded\nby the simultaneous confluence of three separate innovations. The mass\ndigitization of large art archives, the surge in computational power, and the\ndevelopment of robust statistical methods to capture hidden patterns in vast\namounts of data have made it possible to reveal the---otherwise unnoticeable to\nthe human eye---mathematics concealed in large artistic corpora. Starting from\nits inception, marked by the foundational work by Birkhoff (3), progress in the\nbroad field of computational aesthetics has reached a scale that would have\nbeen unimaginable just a decade ago. The recent expansion is not limited to the\nvisual arts (2) but includes music (4), stories (5), language phonology (6),\nhumor in jokes (7), and even equations (8); for a comprehensive review, see\nref. 9.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 10:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

Experimental studies indicate that the factors\nenhancing acquisition of drug resistance in cancer cells include cell\nheterogeneity, drug target alteration, drug inactivation, DNA damage repair,\ndrug efflux, cell death inhibition, as well as microenvironmental adaptations\nto targeted therapy, among others. Combination cancer therapies (CCTs) are\nemployed to overcome these molecular and pathophysiological bottlenecks and\nimprove the overall survival of cancer patients. CCTs often utilize multiple\ncombinatorial modes of action and thus potentially constitute a promising\napproach to overcome drug resistance. Considering the colossal cost, human\neffort, time and ethical issues involved in clinical drug trials and basic\nmedical research, mathematical modeling and analysis can potentially contribute\nimmensely to the discovery of better cancer treatment regimens.

Unlike the popular 3D pose\nestimation setting, the problem is often formulated as inside-out tracking\nbased on embodied perception (e.g., egocentric cameras, handheld sensors). In\nthis paper, we propose a new data-driven framework for inside-out body\ntracking, targeting challenges of omnipresent occlusions in optimization-based\nmethods (e.g., inverse kinematics solvers). We first collect a large-scale\nmotion capture dataset with both body and finger motions using optical markers\nand inertial sensors. This dataset focuses on social scenarios and captures\nground truth poses under self-occlusions and body-hand interactions. We then\nsimulate the occlusion patterns in head-mounted camera views on the captured\nground truth using a ray casting algorithm and learn a deep neural network to\ninfer the occluded body parts. In the experiments, we show that our method is\nable to generate high-fidelity embodied poses by applying the proposed method\non the task of real-time inside-out body tracking, finger motion synthesis, and\n3-point inverse kinematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 09:31:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}
