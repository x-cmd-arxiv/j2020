While adversarial defense mechanisms\nhave been proposed since the discovery of the adversarial vulnerability issue\nof deep neural networks, there is a long path to fully understand and address\nthis issue. In this study, we hypothesize that part of the reason for the\nincredible effectiveness of adversarial attacks is their ability to implicitly\ntap into and exploit the gradient flow of a deep neural network. This innate\nability to exploit gradient flow makes defending against such attacks quite\nchallenging. Motivated by this hypothesis we argue that if a deep neural\nnetwork architecture can explicitly tap into its own gradient flow during the\ntraining, it can boost its defense capability significantly. Inspired by this\nfact, we introduce the concept of self-gradient networks, a novel deep neural\nnetwork architecture designed to be more robust against adversarial\nperturbations. Gradient flow information is leveraged within self-gradient\nnetworks to achieve greater perturbation stability beyond what can be achieved\nin the standard training process. We conduct a theoretical analysis to gain\nbetter insights into the behaviour of the proposed self-gradient networks to\nillustrate the efficacy of leverage this additional gradient flow information.\nThe proposed self-gradient network architecture enables much more efficient and\neffective adversarial training, leading to faster convergence towards an\nadversarially robust solution by at least 10X. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of self-gradient networks when compared with state-of-the-art\nadversarial learning strategies, with 10% improvement on the CIFAR10 dataset\nunder PGD and CW adversarial perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 16:04:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 04:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

Auction theory has historically focused on the question of designing\nthe best way to sell a single item to potential buyers, with the concurrent\nobjectives of maximizing revenue generated or welfare created. Theoretical\nresults in this area have typically relied on some prior Bayesian knowledge\nagents were assumed to have on each-other. This assumption is no longer\nsatisfied in new markets such as online advertising: similar items are sold\nrepeatedly, and agents are unaware of each other or might try to manipulate\neach-other. On the other hand, statistical learning theory now provides tools\nto supplement those missing pieces of information given enough data, as agents\ncan learn from their environment to improve their strategies. This survey\ncovers recent advances in learning in repeated auctions, starting from the\ntraditional economic study of optimal one-shot auctions with a Bayesian prior.\nWe then focus on the question of learning optimal mechanisms from a dataset of\nbidders' past values. The sample complexity as well as the computational\nefficiency of different methods will be studied. We will also investigate\nonline variants where gathering data has a cost to be accounted for, either by\nseller or buyers (\"earning while learning\").

This size dependent semimajor axis drift causes\nfamily members to form structures in the semimajor axis vs inverse diameter\nplane that have the shape of the letter V. The V-shape method consists in\nfinding the borders of such V-shapes of unknown center and opening. Although\nsuccessfully employed to find some very old families in the inner main asteroid\nbelt, the V-shape searching method is very sensitive to many parameters. In\nthis work, we first created and evolved a synthetic asteroid family over\nbillions of years. Then, by adding uncertainties to semimajor axis and diameter\nof the evolved synthetic family components, we randomly generated additional 99\nsimilar, but not perfectly V-shaped, family clones.

A synthetic background with an initially randomly distributed\ncomponents was also created and evolved for 100 Myr. Thus, by setting different\nlevels of ratio of the synthetic family and background asteroids, we derived a\ndetection efficiency map for the V-shape method and determined how sensitive\nthe results can be based on signal-to-noise levels. We also determined optimal\nparameter values for the method's efficiency.

The world of unitary-invariant observables is however much richer in\ntensor models than in matrix models. It is therefore a priori unclear which set\nof observables could satisfy the topological recursion. Such a set of\nobservables was identified a few years ago in the context of the quartic\nmelonic model by the first author and Dartois. It was shown to satisfy an\nextension of the topological recursion introduced by Borot and called the\nblobbed topological recursion. Here we show that this set of observables is\npresent in arbitrary tensor models which have non-vanishing couplings for the\nquartic melonic interactions. It satisfies the blobbed topological recursion in\na universal way, i.e. independently of the choices of the other interactions.\nIn combinatorial terms, the correlation functions describe stuffed maps with\ncolored boundary components. The specifics of the model only appear in the\ngenerating functions of the stuffings and the blobbed topological recursion\nonly requires them to have well-defined $1/N$ expansions. The spectral curve is\na disjoint union of Gaussian spectral curves, with the cylinder function\nreceiving an additional holomorphic part. This result is achieved via a\nperturbative rewriting of tensor models as multi-matrix models due to the first\nauthor, Lionni and Rivasseau. It is then possible to formally integrate all\ndegrees of freedom except those which enter the topological recursion, meaning\ninterpreting the Feynman graphs as stuffed maps.

Most of\nthe extinction modeling efforts have assumed the total abundances (both in gas\nand in dust) of the dust-forming elements---known as the \"interstellar\nabundances\", the \"interstellar reference abundances\", or the \"cosmic\nabundances\"---to be solar and the gas-phase abundances to be independent of the\ninterstellar environments. However, it remains unclear if the solar abundances\nare an appropriate representation of the interstellar abundances. Meanwhile,\nthe gas-phase abundances are known to exhibit appreciable variations with the\nlocal interstellar environments. In this work we explore the viability of the\nabundances of B stars, the solar and protosolar abundances, and the protosolar\nabundances augmented by Galactic chemical enrichment (GCE) as an appropriate\nrepresentation of the interstellar abundances by quantitatively examining the\nextinction and elemental abundances of ten interstellar lines of sight for\nwhich both the extinction curves and the gas-phase abundances of all the major\ndust-forming elements (i.e., C, O, Mg, Si and Fe) have been observationally\ndetermined. Instead of assuming a specific dust model and then fitting the\nobserved extinction curves, for each sightline we apply the model-independent\nKramers-Kronig relation, which relates the wavelength-integrated extinction to\nthe total dust volume, to place a lower limit on the dust depletion. This,\ntogether with the observationally-derived gas-phase abundances, allows us to\nrule out the B-star, solar, and protosolar abundances as the interstellar\nreference standard. We conclude that the GCE-augmented protosolar abundances\nare a viable representation of the interstellar abundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 18:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

In recent years, Bayesian Optimization (BO) has become\nprominent in the field of robotics due to its sample efficiency and little\nprior knowledge needed. However, one drawback of BO is its poor performance on\nhigh-dimensional search spaces as it focuses on global search. In the policy\nsearch setting, local optimization is typically sufficient as initial policies\nare often available, e.g., via meta-learning, kinesthetic demonstrations or\nsim-to-real approaches. In this paper, we propose to constrain the policy\nsearch space to a sublevel-set of the Bayesian surrogate model's predictive\nuncertainty. This simple yet effective way of constraining the policy update\nenables BO to scale to high-dimensional spaces (>100) as well as reduces the\nrisk of damaging the system.

This blurring is\ncaused by the combination of projection and damping, but the loss of signal is\nnot due to exponential decay, as both signal and noise are equally damped.\nSecond, the behavior of the $N$-point correlator in the squeezed and collapsed\n(for $N>3$) limits can enhance the scaling of the signal-to-noise with the\nresolution, even with a reduced range of momenta probing these limits. We\nprovide analytic estimates for all $N$-point correlators. We show that blurring\naffects equilateral-like shapes much more than squeezed ones. We discuss under\nwhat conditions the optimistic scalings in the collapsed limit can be\nexploited. Lastly, we confirm our analytical estimates with numerical\ncalculations of the signal-to-noise for local, orthogonal and equilateral\nbispectra, and local trispectra. We also show that adding polarization to\nintensity data enhances the scaling for equilateral-like spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 18:40:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 09:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

This paper proposes an information-theoretic\nframework for detecting changes of the three levels in a hierarchical way.

We demonstrate that the SFR-normalized HMXB XLF shows clear\ntrends with metallicity, with steadily increasing numbers of luminous and\nultraluminous X-ray sources (logL(erg/s) = 38-40.5) with declining metallicity.\nHowever, we find that the low-luminosity (logL(erg/s) = 36-38) HMXB XLF appears\nto show a nearly constant SFR scaling and slope with metallicity. Our model\nprovides a revised scaling relation of integrated LX/SFR versus 12 + log(O/H)\nand a new characterization of its the SFR-dependent stochastic scatter. The\ngeneral trend of this relation is broadly consistent with past studies based on\nintegrated galaxy emission; however, our model suggests that this relation is\ndriven primarily by the high-luminosity end of the HMXB XLF. Our results have\nimplications for binary population synthesis models, the nature of\nsuper-Eddington accreting objects (e.g., ultraluminous X-ray sources), recent\nefforts to identify active galactic nucleus candidates in dwarf galaxies, and\nthe X-ray radiation fields in the early Universe during the epoch of cosmic\nheating at z > 10.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

But as\nlong as they add up to ${\\cal O}(50)-{\\cal O}(60)$ efolds and the stages of\ndecelerated expansion in between them are shorter and also overall last less,\nthe ensuing cosmology will pass muster. The presence of the interruptions\nresets the efold clock of each accelerating stage, and changes its value at the\nCMB pivot point. This change opens up the theory space, loosening the bounds.\nIn particular some models that seem excluded at ${\\cal N}=60$ fit very well as\nshorter stages with ${\\cal N}=30$. Interesting predictions are that both the\nscalar and tensor spectra of perturbations are rapidly modified at short\nwavelengths. These features could be tested with future CMB spectroscopy\nsearches and with short wavelength primordial gravity probes. The spatial\ncurvature in these models can be larger than the largest wavelength scalar\nperturbations, because $\\Omega_{\\tt k}$ evolves differently than the scalar\nperturbations $\\frac{\\delta \\rho}{\\rho}|_{\\tt S}$. Finally, with many short\nstages of accelerated expansion, the abundance of reheating products from\nprevious accelerated stages does not get completely wiped out.

At the classical\nlevel the model possesses ${\\mathcal N}=1$ superconformal symmetry, which is\npartially broken by quantum anomalies. The form of the anomalies and the part\nof the symmetry they break depend on the multiplet of conserved currents used.\nIt was previously shown that the R-symmetry anomaly of the conformal current\nmultiplet induces an anomaly in Q-supersymmetry, which appears first in 4-point\nfunctions. Here we confirm this result by an explicit 1-loop computation using\na supersymmetric Pauli-Villars regulator.\n  The conformal current multiplet does not exist in the regulated theory\nbecause the regulator breaks conformal invariance, R-symmetry and\nS-supersymmetry explicitly. The minimal massive multiplet is the Ferrara-Zumino\n(FZ) one and the supersymmetry preserved by the regulator is a specific field\ndependent combination of Q- and S- supersymmetry of the conformal multiplet.\nWhile this supersymmetry is non anomalous, conformal invariance, R-symmetry and\nthe original Q- and S-supersymmetries are explicitly broken by finite contact\nterms, both in the regulated and renormalized theories.\n  A conformal current multiplet does exist for the renormalized theory and may\nbe obtained from the FZ multiplet by a set of finite local counterterms that\neliminate the explicit symmetry breaking, thus restoring superconformal\ninvariance up to anomalies. However, this necessarily renders both Q- and\nS-supersymmetries anomalous, as is manifest starting at 4-point functions of\nconformal multiplet currents.

We numerically study this enhancement by an\nadaptation of Tabu Search using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm\n(QAOA) as a neighborhood sampler. We show that QAOA provides a flexible tool\nfor exploration-exploitation in such hybrid settings and can provide evidence\nthat it can help in solving problems faster by saving many tabu iterations and\nachieving better solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 19:30:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 08:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

Using a particle\nmass of $10^{-22}~\\mathrm{eV}/\\mathrm{c}^2$, we show that PySiUltraLight\nproduces spatially oscillating solitons, exploding solitons, and collapsing\nsolitons which prior analytic work shows will occur with attractive\nself-interactions.

This allows for improved robustness and better\ngeneralisation ability. In contrast, deep neural networks are usually designed\nto process one particular information stream and susceptible to various types\nof adversarial perturbations. While many methods exist for detecting and\ndefending against adversarial attacks, they do not generalise across a range of\nattacks and negatively affect performance on clean, unperturbed data. We\ndeveloped a fusion model using a combination of background and foreground\nfeatures extracted in parallel from Places-CNN and Imagenet-CNN. We tested the\nbenefits of the fusion approach on preserving adversarial robustness for human\nperceivable (e.g., Gaussian blur) and network perceivable (e.g.,\ngradient-based) attacks for CIFAR-10 and MS COCO data sets. For gradient based\nattacks, our results show that fusion allows for significant improvements in\nclassification without decreasing performance on unperturbed data and without\nneed to perform adversarial retraining. Our fused model revealed improvements\nfor Gaussian blur type perturbations as well. The increase in performance from\nfusion approach depended on the variability of the image contexts; larger\nincreases were seen for classes of images with larger differences in their\ncontexts. We also demonstrate the effect of regularization to bias the\nclassifier decision in the presence of a known adversary. We propose that this\nbiologically inspired approach to integrate information across multiple\nmodalities provides a new way to improve adversarial robustness that can be\ncomplementary to current state of the art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 20:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

We use the moments of the graph's hitting-time distribution to\nquantify the relationship of each non-seed vertex to the seed-set. This\ninvolves a deterministic calculation for the hitting-time moments that is\nscalable in the number of graph edges and so avoids directly sampling a Markov\nchain over the graph. The moments are used to fit a mixture model to estimate\nthe probability that each non-seed vertex should be grouped with the seed set.\nThis membership probability enables us to sort the non-seeds and threshold in a\nstatistically-justified way.

While HITMIX is a global method, its linear\ncomputation complexity in practice enables computations on large graphs. We\nhave a high-performance implementation, and we present computational results on\nstochastic blockmodels and a small-world network from the SNAP repository. The\nstate of the art in this problem is a collection of recently developed local\nmethods, and we show that distinct advantages in solution quality are available\nif our global method can be used. In practice, we expect to be able to run\nHITMIX if the graph can be stored in memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 20:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

Seq2Seq-DU\nemploys two BERT-based encoders to respectively encode the utterances in the\ndialogue and the descriptions of schemas, an attender to calculate attentions\nbetween the utterance embeddings and the schema embeddings, and a decoder to\ngenerate pointers to represent the current state of dialogue.

Experimental results on\nbenchmark datasets in different settings (SGD, MultiWOZ2.2, MultiWOZ2.1,\nWOZ2.0, DSTC2, M2M, SNIPS, and ATIS) show that Seq2Seq-DU outperforms the\nexisting methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 21:42:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 May 2021 02:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

Accurately estimating this planet\noccurrence rate requires both a well-vetted list of planets and a clear\nunderstanding of the stars searched for planets. Previous ground-based\nfollow-up observations have, through a variety of methods, sought to improve\nour knowledge of stars that are known to host planets. Kepler targets without\ndetected planets, however, have not been subjected to the same intensity of\nfollow-up observations. In this paper, we better constrain stellar multiplicity\nfor stars around which Kepler could have theoretically detected a transiting\nEarth-sized planet in the habitable zone. We subsequently aim to improve\nestimates of the exoplanet search completeness -- the fraction of exoplanets\nthat were detected by Kepler -- with our analysis. By obtaining adaptive optics\nobservations of 71 Kepler target stars from the Shane 3-m telescope at Lick\nObservatory, we detected 14 candidate stellar companions within 4'' of 13\ntarget stars. Of these 14 candidate stellar companions, we determine through\nmultiple independent methods that 3 are likely to be bound to their\ncorresponding target star. We then assess the impact of our observations on\nexoplanet occurrence rate calculations, finding an increase in occurrence of 6%\n(0.9 $\\sigma$) for various estimates of the frequency of Earth-like planets and\nan increase of 26% (4.5 $\\sigma$) for super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. These\noccurrence increases are not entirely commensurate with theoretical\npredictions, though this discrepancy may be due to differences in the treatment\nof stellar binarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 22:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Notably,\nanalysis of the BBH population suggests the presence of binaries whose\ncomponent spins are significantly misaligned with respect to their orbital\nangular momenta. Significantly misaligned spins are typically predicted to be\nat odds with isolated field formation via standard common envelope (CE)\nevolution, and hence a \"smoking gun\" signature of dynamical binary formation\ninside dense stellar clusters. Here, we explore whether the LIGO/Virgo\nobservation of spin-orbit misalignment indeed rules out the possibility that\nBBHs are formed entirely in the field via standard CE evolution. In particular,\nwe seek to understand whether, by varying the natal kicks black holes receive\nupon formation, we can invoke the CE scenario to self-consistently explain both\nthe observed spin distribution and merger rate of BBHs. We find that, if\nisolated black holes are born with small natal spins, then BBHs formed through\nCE require extreme natal kicks to match the observed BBH population, with a\nvelocity dispersion $\\sigma =\n9.7^{+26.7}_{-5.9}\\times10^2\\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and\n$\\sigma>260\\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at 99% credibility.

Early\ndetection of seizures can help to mitigate injuries, and can be used to aid the\ntreatment of patients with epilepsy. The purpose of a seizure prediction system\nis to successfully identify the pre-ictal brain stage, which occurs before a\nseizure event. Patient-independent seizure prediction models are designed to\noffer accurate performance across multiple subjects within a dataset, and have\nbeen identified as a real-world solution to the seizure prediction problem.\nHowever, little attention has been given for designing such models to adapt to\nthe high inter-subject variability in EEG data. Methods: We propose two\npatient-independent deep learning architectures with different learning\nstrategies that can learn a global function utilizing data from multiple\nsubjects. Results: Proposed models achieve state-of-the-art performance for\nseizure prediction on the CHB-MIT-EEG dataset, demonstrating 88.81% and 91.54%\naccuracy respectively. Conclusions: The Siamese model trained on the proposed\nlearning strategy is able to learn patterns related to patient variations in\ndata while predicting seizures. Significance: Our models show superior\nperformance for patient-independent seizure prediction, and the same\narchitecture can be used as a patient-specific classifier after model\nadaptation.

Recent\ndevelopment of magnetic reconnection has shown that numerous plasmoids can be\nproduced in a large-scale current layer. Here we investigate the dynamical\nmodulation of electron acceleration in the looptop region when plasmoids\nintermittently arrive at the shock by combining magnetohydrodynamics\nsimulations with a particle kinetic model. As plasmoids interact with the\nshock, the looptop region exhibits various compressible structures that\nmodulate the production of energetic electrons. The energetic electron\npopulation varies rapidly in both time and space. The number of 5$-$10 keV\nelectrons correlates well with the area with compression, while that of $>$50\nkeV electrons shows good correlation with strong compression area but only\nmoderate correlation with shock parameters. We further examine the impacts of\nthe first plasmoid, which marks the transition from a quasi-steady shock front\nto a distorted and dynamical shock. The number of energetic electrons is\nreduced by $\\sim 20\\%$ at 15$-$25 keV and nearly 40\\% for 25$-$50 keV, while\nthe number of 5$-$10 keV electrons increases. In addition, the electron energy\nspectrum above 10 keV evolves softer with time. We also find double or even\nmultiple distinct sources can develop in the looptop region when the plasmoids\nmove across the shock. Our simulations have strong implications to the\ninterpretation of nonthermal looptop sources, as well as the commonly observed\nfast temporal variations in flare emissions, including the quasi-periodic\npulsations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 23:34:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

This occurs\nwhen the atom is in a superposition of internal states but only one of these\nstates is manipulated by visible or UV photons. The Schr\\\"odinger equation that\ndescribes this situation is presented and two cases are explored. In the first\ncase, the entanglement arises because the spatial wave function shifts due to\nthe separation in time between excitation and stimulated emission. For neutral\natoms in a harmonic trap, the decoherence can be expressed within a sudden\napproximation when the duration of the laser pulses are shorter than the\nharmonic oscillator period. In this limit, the decoherence is given by simple\nanalytic formulas that account for the momentum of the photon, the temperature\nof the atoms, the harmonic oscillator frequency, and atomic mass. In the second\ncase, there is a reduction in gate fidelity because the photons causing\nabsorption and stimulated emission are in focused beam modes. This leads to a\ndependence of the optically induced changes in the internal states on the\ncenter of mass atomic position. In the limit where the time between pulses is\nshort, the decoherence can be expressed as a simple analytic formula involving\nthe laser waist, temperature of the atoms, the trap frequency and the atomic\nmass.

When a job parallelizes across multiple servers it will complete\nmore quickly, but jobs receive diminishing returns from being allocated\nadditional servers. Because allocating multiple servers to a single job is\ninefficient, it is unclear how best to allocate a fixed number of servers\nbetween many parallelizable jobs. This paper provides the first optimal\nallocation policy for minimizing the mean slowdown of parallelizable jobs of\nknown size when all jobs are present at time 0. Our policy provides a simple\nclosed form formula for the optimal allocations at every moment in time.\nMinimizing mean slowdown usually requires favoring short jobs over long ones\n(as in the SRPT policy). However, because parallelizable jobs have sublinear\nspeedup functions, system efficiency is also an issue. System efficiency is\nmaximized by giving equal allocations to all jobs and thus competes with the\ngoal of prioritizing small jobs. Our optimal policy, high-efficiency SRPT\n(heSRPT), balances these competing goals. heSRPT completes jobs according to\ntheir size order, but maintains overall system efficiency by allocating some\nservers to each job at every moment in time. Our results generalize to also\nprovide the optimal allocation policy with respect to mean flow time. Finally,\nwe consider the online case where jobs arrive to the system over time. While\noptimizing mean slowdown in the online setting is even more difficult, we find\nthat heSRPT provides an excellent heuristic policy for the online setting. In\nfact, our simulations show that heSRPT significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art allocation policies for parallelizable jobs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 18:56:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

Here, through the finite\nelement method, we show how ICR of conical nanopores with length below 200 nm\ncan be tuned by controlling individual charged surfaces i.e. inner pore surface\n(surface_inner), and exterior pore surfaces on the tip and base side\n(surface_tip and surface_base). The charged surface_inner and surface_tip can\ninduce obvious ICR individually, while the effects of the charged surface_base\non ICR can be ignored. The fully charged surface_inner alone could render the\nnanopore counterion-selective and induces significant ion concentration\npolarization in the tip region, which causes reverse ICR compared to nanopores\nwith all surface charged. In addition, the direction and degree of\nrectification can be further tuned by the depth of the charged surface_inner.\nWhen considering the exterior membrane surface only, the charged surface_tip\ncauses intra-pore ionic enrichment and depletion under opposite biases which\nresults in significant ICR. Its effective region is within ~40 nm beyond the\ntip orifice. We also found that individual charged parts of the pore system\ncontributed to ICR in an additive way due to the additive effect on the ion\nconcentration regulation along the pore axis. With various combinations of\nfully/partially charged surface_inner and surface_tip, diverse ICR ratios from\n~2 to ~170 can be achieved.

Specifically, by disentangling the face image into 3D shape,\ncommon texture, identity texture, ambient light, and direct light, we find the\ndevil lies in the direct light and the identity texture. Based on this\nobservation, we propose to utilize facial detail, which is the combination of\ndirect light and identity texture, as the clue to detect the subtle forgery\npatterns. Besides, we highlight the manipulated region with a supervised\nattention mechanism and introduce a two-stream structure to exploit both face\nimage and facial detail together as a multi-modality task.

The intrinsic\nlimitation in spatial resolution of these instruments implies that the spectra\nassociated with pixels of such images are most often mixtures of the spectra of\nthe \"pure\" components that exist in the considered region. In order to estimate\nthe spectra and spatial abundances of these pure components, we here propose an\noriginal blind signal separation (BSS), that is to say an unsupervised unmixing\nmethod. Our approach is based on extensions and combinations of linear BSS\nmethods that belong to two major classes of methods, namely nonnegative matrix\nfactorization (NMF) and Sparse Component Analysis (SCA). The former performs\nthe decomposition of hyperspectral images, as a set of pure spectra and\nabundance maps, by using nonnegativity constraints, but the estimated solution\nis not unique: It highly depends on the initialization of the algorithm. The\nconsidered SCA methods are based on the assumption of the existence of points\nor tiny spatial zones where only one source is active (i.e., one pure component\nis present). In real conditions, the assumption of perfect single-source points\nor zones is not always realistic. In such conditions, SCA yields approximate\nversions of the unknown sources and mixing coefficients. We propose to use part\nof these preliminary estimates from the SCA to initialize several runs of the\nNMF to constrain the convergence of the NMF algorithm. Detailed tests with\nsynthetic data show that the decomposition achieved with such hybrid methods is\nnearly unique and provides good performance, illustrating the potential of\napplications to real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 09:43:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

The simplest\ninstance of this construction, corresponding to the product of 3 repetition\ncodes, is a non CSS variant of the 3-dimensional toric code known as the Chamon\ncode. The general construction was introduced in Denise Maurice's PhD thesis,\nbut has remained poorly understood so far. The reason is that while hypergraph\nproduct codes can be analyzed with combinatorial tools, the XYZ product codes\nalso depend crucially on the algebraic properties of the parity-check matrices\nof the three classical codes, making their analysis much more involved.\n  Our main motivation for studying XYZ product codes is that the natural\nrepresentatives of logical operators are two-dimensional objects. This\ncontrasts with standard hypergraph product codes in 3 dimensions which always\nadmit one-dimensional logical operators. In particular, specific instances of\nXYZ product codes with constant rate might display a minimum distance as large\nas $\\Theta(N^{2/3})$. While we do not prove this result here, we obtain the\ndimension of a large class of XYZ product codes, and when restricting to codes\nwith dimension 1, we reduce the problem of computing the minimum distance to a\nmore elementary combinatorial problem involving binary 3-tensors. We also\ndiscuss in detail some families of XYZ product codes that can be embedded in\nthree dimensions with local interaction. Some of these codes seem to share\nproperties with Haah's cubic codes and might be interesting candidates for\nself-correcting quantum memories with a logarithmic energy barrier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 09:50:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 12:05:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 15:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

Notwithstanding, semantically enriched,\nthe size of semantic sensor data is substantially larger than raw sensor data.\nMoreover, some measurement values can be observed by sensors several times, and\na huge number of repeated facts about sensor data can be produced. We propose a\ncompact or factorized representation of semantic sensor data, where repeated\nmeasurement values are described only once. Furthermore, these compact\nrepresentations are able to enhance the storage and processing of semantic\nsensor data. To scale up to large datasets, factorization based, tabular\nrepresentations are exploited to store and manage factorized semantic sensor\ndata using Big Data technologies.

Instead of working with the\ngrid packing technique introduced by Mitzenmacher and Seddighin, we take a\ndifferent approach building on a new tool that might be of independent\ninterest: LIS sparsification.\n  A particularly interesting consequence of our result is an improved solution\nfor the so-called Erd\\H{o}s-Szekeres partitioning, in which we seek a partition\nof a given permutation of $\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$ into $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n})$\nmonotone subsequences. This problem has been repeatedly stated as one of the\nnatural examples in which we see a large gap between the decision-tree\ncomplexity and algorithmic complexity. The result of Mitzenmacher and Seddighin\nimplies an $\\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\\epsilon})$ time solution for this problem, for\nany $\\epsilon>0$. Our algorithm (in fact, its simpler decremental version)\nfurther improves this to $\\mathcal{\\tilde O}(n)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 10:39:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 12:13:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

The spin-down evolution of the NS\ncan sometimes be affected by fallback accretion, although it is usually\nregulated by the magnetic dipole radiation and gravitational wave radiation of\nthe NS.

To derive a robust optimization model, a\ncentral ingredient is to identify a suitable model for uncertainty, which is\ncalled the uncertainty set. An ongoing challenge in the recent literature is to\nderive uncertainty sets from given historical data that result in solutions\nthat are robust regarding future scenarios. In this paper we use an\nunsupervised deep learning method to learn and extract hidden structures from\ndata, leading to non-convex uncertainty sets and better robust solutions. We\nprove that most of the classical uncertainty classes are special cases of our\nderived sets and that optimizing over them is strongly NP-hard. Nevertheless,\nwe show that the trained neural networks can be integrated into a robust\noptimization model by formulating the adversarial problem as a convex quadratic\nmixed-integer program. This allows us to derive robust solutions through an\niterative scenario generation process. In our computational experiments, we\ncompare this approach to a similar approach using kernel-based support vector\nclustering.

Millions of deaths can be averted\nby early diagnosis and successful treatment of TB patients. Automated diagnosis\nof TB holds vast potential to assist medical experts in expediting and\nimproving its diagnosis, especially in developing countries like India, where\nthere is a shortage of trained medical experts and radiologists. To date,\nseveral deep learning based methods for automated detection of TB from chest\nradiographs have been proposed. However, the performance of a few of these\nmethods on the Indian chest radiograph data set has been suboptimal, possibly\ndue to different texture of the lungs on chest radiographs of Indian subjects\ncompared to other countries. Thus deep learning for accurate and automated\ndiagnosis of TB on Indian datasets remains an important subject of research.\nMethods: The proposed work explores the performance of convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) for the diagnosis of TB in Indian chest x-ray images. Three\ndifferent pre-trained neural network models, AlexNet, GoogLenet, and ResNet are\nused to classify chest x-ray images into healthy or TB infected. The proposed\napproach does not require any pre-processing technique. Also, other works use\npre-trained NNs as a tool for crafting features and then apply standard\nclassification techniques. However, we attempt an end to end NN model based\ndiagnosis of TB from chest x-rays. The proposed visualization tool can also be\nused by radiologists in the screening of large datasets. Results: The proposed\nmethod achieved 93.40% accuracy with 98.60% sensitivity to diagnose TB for the\nIndian population. Conclusions: The performance of the proposed method is also\ntested against techniques described in the literature. The proposed method\noutperforms the state of art on Indian and Shenzhen datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 11:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

It is important to achieve\nthe highest possible sensitivity to faint sources such as planets, using both\nhardware and data analysis software. While analytic methods are efficient, real\nsystems are better-modelled numerically, but such models with many parameters\ncan be hard to understand, optimize and apply. Automatic differentiation\nsoftware developed for machine learning now makes calculating derivatives with\nrespect to aberrations straightforward for arbitrary optical systems. We apply\nthis powerful new tool to enhance high-angular-resolution astronomical imaging.\nSelf-calibrating observables such as the 'closure phase' or 'bispectrum' have\nbeen widely used in optical and radio astronomy to mitigate optical aberrations\nand achieve high-fidelity imagery. Kernel phases are a generalization of\nclosure phases in the limit of small phase errors. Using automatic\ndifferentiation, we reproduce existing kernel phase theory within this\nframework and demonstrate an extension to the Lyot coronagraph, finding\nself-calibrating combinations of speckles which are resistant to phase noise,\nbut only in the very high-wavefront-quality regime. As an illustrative example,\nwe reanalyze Palomar adaptive optics observations of the binary alpha Ophiuchi,\nfinding consistency between the new pipeline and the existing standard.

This results in a morphed image that can be\ndecoded to recover the original bitstring. The use-case is similar to that of\nthe well-known QR code, but our solution provides creatives with artistic\nfreedom to transfer digital information via drawings of their own design. The\nmethod comprises two neural networks, which are trained jointly: an encoder\nnetwork that transforms a bitstring into a perturbation of the drawing\nprimitives, and a decoder network that recovers the bitstring from an image of\nthe morphed drawing. To enable end-to-end training via back propagation, we\nintroduce a soft rasterizer, which is differentiable with respect to\nperturbations of the drawing primitives. In order to add robustness towards\nreal-world image capture conditions, image corruptions are injected between the\nsoft rasterizer and the decoder. Further, the addition of an object detection\nand camera pose estimation system enables decoding of drawings in complex\nscenes as well as use of the drawings as markers for use in augmented reality\napplications. We demonstrate that our method reliably recovers bitstrings from\nreal-world photos of printed drawings, thereby providing a novel solution for\ncreatives to transfer digital information via artistic imagery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 11:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

The beauty of these states is that these states can be\nused to establish quantum supremacy. Earlier, a considerable amount of works\nhas been reported on various types of quantum states and their nonclassical\nproperties. Here, complementing the earlier works, the effect of\nnon-Gaussianity inducing operators on the nonclassical and phase properties of\ndisplaced Fock states have been studied. This thesis includes 6 chapters. In\nChapter 1, motivation behind performing the present work is stated explicitly,\nalso the basic concepts of quantum optics are discussed with a specific\nattention on the witnesses and measures of nonclassicality. In Chapter 2,\nnonclassical properties of photon added and subtracted displaced Fock states\nhave been studied using various witnesses of lower- and higher-order\nnonclassicality which are introduced in Chapter 1. In Chapter 3, we have\ncontinued our investigation on photon added and subtracted displaced Fock\nstates (and their limiting cases). In this chapter, quantum phase properties of\nthese states are investigated from a number of perspectives, and it is shown\nthat the quantum phase properties are dependent on the quantum state\nengineering operations performed. In Chapter 4, we have continued our\ninvestigation on the impact of non-Gaussianity inducing operators on the\nnonclassical and phase properties of the displaced Fock states. In Chapter 5,\nwe have performed a comparison between to process that are used in quantum\nstate engineering to induce nonclassical features.

In addition, their simple design opens up new opportunities for\njoint multi-task learning. In this paper, we demonstrate that adding a single\nclassification layer for semantic segmentation, fully-convolutional instance\nsegmentation networks can achieve state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation\nquality. This is made possible by our novel dynamic rank-1 convolution\n(DR1Conv), a novel dynamic module that can efficiently merge high-level context\ninformation with low-level detailed features which is beneficial for both\nsemantic and instance segmentation. Importantly, the proposed new method,\ntermed DR1Mask, can perform panoptic segmentation by adding a single layer. To\nour knowledge, DR1Mask is the first panoptic segmentation framework that\nexploits a shared feature map for both instance and semantic segmentation by\nconsidering both efficacy and efficiency. Not only our framework is much more\nefficient -- twice as fast as previous best two-branch approaches, but also the\nunified framework opens up opportunities for using the same context module to\nimprove the performance for both tasks. As a byproduct, when performing\ninstance segmentation alone, DR1Mask is 10% faster and 1 point in mAP more\naccurate than previous state-of-the-art instance segmentation network\nBlendMask.

The application of a relatively low magnetic field\nof 2 T along the easy magnetization axis (a) gives rise to a maximum entropy\nchange of about 20 J/kg K at 4 K. More interestingly, under sufficiently high\nmagnetic fields, the isothermal entropy change -{\\Delta}ST remains\napproximately constant over a wide temperature range which is highly\nappreciated from a practical point of view. In the magnetic field change of 7\nT, -{\\Delta}ST that reaches roughly 22 J/kg K remains practically unchanged\nbetween 0 and 34 K leading to an outstanding refrigerant capacity of about 823\nJ/kg. On the other hand, the lowering of crystallographic symmetry from the\ntetragonal to the orthorhombic structure occurring close to 33 K as confirmed\nby Raman scattering data results in a strong magnetic anisotropy. Accordingly,\nstrong thermal effects can be also obtained simply by spinning the TbVO4 single\ncrystals between their hard and easy orientations in constant magnetic fields\ninstead the standard magnetization-demagnetization process.

Typically, a confocal arrangement of lenses with a diaphragm in\nthe focal plane is used for intracavity spatial filtering. Such conventional\nfiltering requires access to the far-field domain. In microlasers, however,\nconventional filtering is impossible due to the lack of space in\nmicro-resonators to access the far-field.

We aimed to identify published methods for\ndeveloping and validating prediction models that enable risk estimation of\noutcomes under hypothetical interventions, utilizing causal inference: their\nmain methodological approaches, underlying assumptions, targeted estimands, and\npotential pitfalls and challenges with using the method, and unresolved\nmethodological challenges.\n  Methods: We systematically reviewed literature published by December 2019,\nconsidering papers in the health domain that used causal considerations to\nenable prediction models to be used for predictions under hypothetical\ninterventions.\n  Results: We identified 4919 papers through database searches and a further\n115 papers through manual searches, of which 13 were selected for inclusion,\nfrom both the statistical and the machine learning literature.

In contrast to classical Tarski semantics, a formula is evaluated\nnot for a single assignment of values to the free variables, but on a set of\nsuch assignments, called a team. Team semantics is appropriate for a purely\nlogical understanding of dependency notions, where only the presence or absence\nof data matters, but based on sets, it does not take into account multiple\noccurrences of data values. It is therefore insufficient in scenarios where\nsuch multiplicities matter, in particular for reasoning about probabilities and\nstatistical independencies. Therefore, an extension from teams to multiteams\n(i.e. multisets of assignments) has been proposed by several authors.\n  In this paper we aim at a systematic development of logics of dependence and\nindependence based on multiteam semantics. We study atomic dependency\nproperties of finite multiteams and discuss the appropriate meaning of logical\noperators to extend the atomic dependencies to full-fledged logics for\nreasoning about dependence properties in a multiteam setting. We explore\nproperties and expressive power of a wide spectrum of different multiteam\nlogics and compare them to logics with team semantics. We also study the\nrelationship of logics with multiteam semantics with existential second-order\nlogic for a specific class of metafinite structures. It turns out that\ninclusion-exclusion logic can be characterised in a precise sense by the\nPresburger fragment of this logic, but for capturing independence, we need to\ngo beyond it and add some form of multiplication. Finally we also consider\nmultiteams with weights in the reals and study the expressive power of formulae\nby means of topological properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 14:18:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

Weak lensing missions, in\nparticular, aim at measuring the shape of galaxies, and PSF effects represent\nan important source of systematic errors which must be handled appropriately.\nThis demands a high accuracy in the modelling as well as the estimation of the\nPSF at galaxy positions. Sometimes referred to as non-parametric PSF\nestimation, the goal of this paper is to estimate a PSF at galaxy positions,\nstarting from a set of noisy star image observations distributed over the focal\nplane. To accomplish this, we need our model to first of all, precisely capture\nthe PSF field variations over the Field of View (FoV), and then to recover the\nPSF at the selected positions. This paper proposes a new method, coined MCCD\n(Multi-CCD PSF modelling), that creates, simultaneously, a PSF field model over\nall of the instrument's focal plane. This allows to capture global as well as\nlocal PSF features through the use of two complementary models which enforce\ndifferent spatial constraints. Most existing non-parametric models build one\nmodel per Charge Coupled Device (CCD), which can lead to difficulties in\ncapturing global ellipticity patterns. We first test our method on a realistic\nsimulated dataset comparing it with two state-of-the-art PSF modelling methods\n(PSFEx and RCA). We outperform both of them with our proposed method. Then we\ncontrast our approach with PSFEx on real data from CFIS (Canada France Imaging\nSurvey) that uses the CFHT (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope). We show that our\nPSF model is less noisy and achieves a 22% gain on pixel Root Mean Squared\nError (RMSE) with respect to PSFEx. We present, and share the code of, a new\nPSF modelling algorithm that models the PSF field on all the focal plane that\nis mature enough to handle real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 14:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

The XFDDS is a hybrid approach that\ncombines the model-based and data-driven framework. Model-based FDD for PV\npanels lacks high fidelity models at low irradiance conditions for detecting\nincipient faults. To overcome this, a novel irradiance based three diode model\n(IB3DM) is proposed. It is a nine parameter model that provides higher accuracy\neven at low irradiance conditions, an important aspect for detecting incipient\nfaults from noise. To exploit PV data, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is\nused due to its ability to detecting incipient faults. Lack of explainability,\nfeature variability for sample instances, and false alarms are challenges with\ndata-driven FDD methods. These shortcomings are overcome by hybridization of\nXGBoost and IB3DM, and using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)\ntechniques. To combine the XGBoost and IB3DM, a fault-signature metric is\nproposed that helps reducing false alarms and also trigger an explanation on\ndetecting incipient faults. To provide explainability, an eXplainable\nArtificial Intelligence (XAI) application is developed. It uses the local\ninterpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) framework and provides\nexplanations on classifier outputs for data instances.

In this work, we study the temporal evolution of the radius valley\nusing two independent determinations of host star ages among the\nCalifornia-Kepler Survey (CKS) sample. We find evidence for a wide and nearly\nempty void of planets in the period-radius diagram at the youngest system ages\n($\\lesssim$2-3 Gyr) represented in the CKS sample.

Relative to previous studies of preferentially\nolder planets, the radius valley determined among the younger planetary sample\nis shifted to smaller radii. This result is compatible with an atmospheric loss\ntimescale on the order of gigayears for progenitors of the largest observed\nsuper-Earths. In support of this interpretation, we show that the planet sizes\nwhich appear to be unrepresented at ages $\\lesssim$2-3 Gyr are likely to\ncorrespond to planets with rocky compositions.

A leading paradigm to\nresolve the tension is a period of early dark energy, in which a scalar field\ncontributes a subdominant part of the energy budget of the universe at this\ntime. This scenario faces significant fine-tuning problems which can be\nameliorated by a non-trivial coupling of the scalar to the standard model\nneutrinos. These become non-relativistic close to the time of matter-radiation\nequality, resulting in an energy injection into the scalar that kick-starts the\nearly dark energy phase, explaining its coincidence with this seemingly\nunrelated epoch. We present a minimal version of this neutrino-assisted early\ndark energy model, and perform a detailed analysis of its predictions and\ntheoretical constraints.

In these problems, requests arrive\nsequentially during a finite horizon and, for each request, a decision maker\nneeds to choose an action that consumes a certain amount of resources and\ngenerates reward. The objective is to maximize cumulative rewards subject to a\nconstraint on the total consumption of resources. In this paper, we consider a\ndata-driven setting in which the reward and resource consumption of each\nrequest are generated using an input model that is unknown to the decision\nmaker. We design a general class of algorithms that attain good performance in\nvarious input models without knowing which type of input they are facing. In\nparticular, our algorithms are asymptotically optimal under independent and\nidentically distributed inputs as well as various non-stationary stochastic\ninput models, and they attain an asymptotically optimal fixed competitive ratio\nwhen the input is adversarial. Our algorithms operate in the Lagrangian dual\nspace: they maintain a dual multiplier for each resource that is updated using\nonline mirror descent. By choosing the reference function accordingly, we\nrecover the dual sub-gradient descent and dual multiplicative weights update\nalgorithm. The resulting algorithms are simple, fast, and do not require\nconvexity in the revenue function, consumption function and action space, in\ncontrast to existing methods for online allocation problems.

First, we propose a cooperative\nframework for solving the problem of device activity detection in sourced\nrandom access. In particular, multiple access points (APs) cooperatively detect\nthe device activity via exchanging low-dimensional intermediate information\nwith their neighbors. This is enabled by the proposed covariance-based\nalgorithm via exploiting both the sparsity-promoting and similarity-promoting\nterms of the device state vectors among neighboring APs. A decentralized\napproximate separating approach is introduced based on the forward-backward\nsplitting strategy for addressing the formulated problem. Then, the proposed\nactivity detection algorithm is adopted as a decoder of cooperative unsourced\nrandom access, where the multiple APs cooperatively detect the list of\ntransmitted messages regardless of the identity of the transmitting devices.\nFinally, we provide sufficient conditions on the step sizes that ensure the\nconvergence of the proposed algorithm in the sense of Bregman divergence.\nSimulation results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient for addressing\nboth sourced and unsourced massive random access problems, while requires a\nshorter signature sequence and accommodates a significantly larger number of\nactive devices with a reasonable antenna array size, compared with the\nstate-of-art algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 00:23:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-23"}

In general,\nthe coupling strength $\\gamma_{DE}$ is close to $0$ as the interaction between\nDE and WIMP DM is very weak, thus the effect of $\\gamma_ {DE}$ on the evolution\nof $Y$ associated with DM energy density can be safely neglected.

Removing words that\ncan negatively impact the quality of prediction algorithms or are not\ninformative enough is a crucial storage-saving technique in text indexing and\nresults in improved computational efficiency. Typically, a generic stop word\nlist is applied to a dataset regardless of the domain. However, many common\nwords are different from one domain to another but have no significance within\na particular domain. Eliminating domain-specific common words in a corpus\nreduces the dimensionality of the feature space, and improves the performance\nof text mining tasks. In this paper, we present a novel mathematical approach\nfor the automatic extraction of domain-specific words called the\nhyperplane-based approach. This new approach depends on the notion of low\ndimensional representation of the word in vector space and its distance from\nhyperplane. The hyperplane-based approach can significantly reduce text\ndimensionality by eliminating irrelevant features. We compare the\nhyperplane-based approach with other feature selection methods, namely \\c{hi}2\nand mutual information. An experimental study is performed on three different\ndatasets and five classification algorithms, and measure the dimensionality\nreduction and the increase in the classification performance. Results indicate\nthat the hyperplane-based approach can reduce the dimensionality of the corpus\nby 90% and outperforms mutual information. The computational time to identify\nthe domain-specific words is significantly lower than mutual information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 17:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

About half of all mTBI patients experience a diverse array of\nchronic symptoms which persist long after the acute injury. Hence, there is an\nurgent need for better understanding of the white matter and gray matter\npathologies associated with mTBI to map which specific brain systems are\nimpacted and identify courses of intervention. Previous works have linked mTBI\nto disruptions in white matter pathways and cortical surface abnormalities.\nHerein, we examine these hypothesized links in an exploratory study of joint\nstructural connectivity and cortical surface changes associated with mTBI and\nits chronic symptoms. Briefly, we consider a cohort of 12 mTBI and 26 control\nsubjects. A set of 588 cortical surface metrics and 4,753 structural\nconnectivity metrics were extracted from cortical surface regions and diffusion\nweighted magnetic resonance imaging in each subject. Principal component\nanalysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of each metric set. We\nthen applied independent component analysis (ICA) both to each PCA space\nindividually and together in a joint ICA approach. We identified a stable\nindependent component across the connectivity-only and joint ICAs which\npresented significant group differences in subject loadings (p<0.05,\ncorrected). Additionally, we found that two mTBI symptoms, slowed thinking and\nforgetfulness, were significantly correlated (p<0.05, corrected) with mTBI\nsubject loadings in a surface-only ICA. These surface-only loadings captured an\nincrease in bilateral cortical thickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 19:39:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 16:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}
