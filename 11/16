In contrast, the\npresent paper develops methods that produce these projections in a finite and\napproximately minimal number of iterations. Building upon tools from graph\nsignal processing, the problem is cast as the design of a graph filter which,\nin turn, is reduced to the design of a suitable graph shift operator.\nExploiting the eigenstructure of the projection and shift matrices leads to an\nobjective whose minimization yields approximately minimum-order graph filters.\nTo cope with the fact that this problem is not convex, the present work\nintroduces a novel convex relaxation of the number of distinct eigenvalues of a\nmatrix based on the nuclear norm of a Kronecker difference. To tackle the case\nwhere there exists no graph filter capable of implementing a certain subspace\nprojection with a given network topology, a second optimization criterion is\npresented to approximate the desired projection while trading the number of\niterations for approximation error.

The first\npart demonstrates, that the adjoint complement can be derived in two ways,\neither following a first simplify then derive or a first derive and then\nsimplify strategy. The simplification step comprises the classical\nboundary-layer (b.-l.) approximation and the derivation step transfers the\nprimal flow equation into a companion adjoint equation.\n  The second part of the paper comprises the analyses of the coupled\nprimal/adjoint b.-l. framework. This leads to similarity parameters, which turn\nthe Partial-Differential-Equation (PDE) problem into a boundary value problem\ndescribed by a set of Ordinary-Differential-Equations (ODE) and support the\nformulation of an adjoint complement to the classical Blasius equation.\nOpposite to the primal Blasius equation, its adjoint complement consists of two\nODEs which can be simplified depending on the treatment of advection. It is\nshown, that the advective fluxes, which are frequently debated in the\nliterature, vanish for the investigated self-similar b.l. flows. Differences\nbetween the primal and the adjoint Blasius framework are discussed against\nnumerical solutions, and analytical expressions are derived for the adjoint\nb.-l. thickness, wall shear stress and subordinated skin friction and drag\ncoefficients. The analysis also provides an analytical expression for the shape\nsensitivity to shear driven drag objectives.\n  The third part assesses the predictive agreement between the different\nBlasius solutions and numerical results for Navier-Stokes simulations of a flat\nplate b.-l. at Reynolds numbers between 1E+03 <= ReL <= 1E+05 .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 17:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

Inland surface waters expand\nwith floods and contract with droughts, so there is no one map of our streams.\nCurrent satellite approaches are limited to monthly observations that map only\nthe widest streams. These are fed by smaller tributaries that make up much of\nthe dendritic surface network but whose flow is unobserved. A complete map of\nour daily waters can give us an early warning for where droughts are born: the\nreceding tips of the flowing network. Mapping them over years can give us a map\nof impermanence of our waters, showing where to expect water, and where not to.\nTo that end, we feed the latest high-res sensor data to multiple deep learning\nmodels in order to map these flowing networks every day, stacking the times\nseries maps over many years. Specifically, i) we enhance water segmentation to\n$50$ cm/pixel resolution, a 60$\\times$ improvement over previous\nstate-of-the-art results. Our U-Net trained on 30-40cm WorldView3 images can\ndetect streams as narrow as 1-3m (30-60$\\times$ over SOTA). Our multi-sensor,\nmulti-res variant, WasserNetz, fuses a multi-day window of 3m PlanetScope\nimagery with 1m LiDAR data, to detect streams 5-7m wide. Both U-Nets produce a\nwater probability map at the pixel-level. ii) We integrate this water map over\na DEM-derived synthetic valley network map to produce a snapshot of flow at the\nstream level. iii) We apply this pipeline, which we call Pix2Streams, to a\n2-year daily PlanetScope time-series of three watersheds in the US to produce\nthe first high-fidelity dynamic map of stream flow frequency. The end result is\na new map that, if applied at the national scale, could fundamentally improve\nhow we manage our water resources around the world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 17:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

It is well-known that the coupling between the\notherwise degenerate Zeeman levels $|M_S=\\pm1\\rangle$ due to strain and\nelectric fields is responsible for a Landau-Zener process near the\npseudo-crossing of the adiabatic energy levels when the axial component of the\noscillating magnetic field changes sign. We derive an effective two-level\nHamiltonian for the NV system that includes coupling between the two levels via\nvirtual transitions into the third far-detuned level $|M_S=0\\rangle$ induced by\ntransverse magnetic fields. This coupling adds to the coupling due to strain\nand electric fields, with a phase that depends on the direction of the\ntransverse field in the plane perpendicular to the NV axis. Hence, the {\\em\ntotal coupling} of the Zeeman levels can be tuned to control the adiabaticity\nof spin dynamics by fully or partially compensating the effect of the strain\nand electric fields, or by enhancing it. Moreover, by varying the strength and\ndirection of the transverse magnetic fields, one can determine the strength and\ndirection of the local strain and electric fields at the position of the NV\ncenter, and even the {\\em external} stress and electric field. The nuclear spin\nhyperfine interaction is shown to introduce a nuclear spin dependent offset of\nthe axial magnetic field for which the pseudo-crossing occurs, while the\nadiabaticity remains unaffected by the nuclear spin. If the NV center is\ncoupled to the environment, modeled by a bath with a Gaussian white noise\nspectrum, as appropriate for NVs near the diamond surface, then the spin\ndynamics is accompanied by relaxation of the Zeeman level populations and\ndecoherence with a non-monotonic decrease of the purity of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 19:25:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:01:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2022 19:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

The derived physical parameters for young HII regions are normally\ndetermined assuming the emission region to be optically thin. However, this\nassumption is unlikely to hold for young HII regions such as hyper-compact\nHII(HCHII) and ultra-compact HII(UCHII) regions and leads to the\nunderestimation of their properties. This can be overcome by fitting the SEDs\nover a wide range of radio frequencies.\n  Aims. The two primary goals of this study are (1) to determine the physical\nproperties of young HII regions from radio SEDs in the search for potential\nHCHII regions, and (2) to use these physical properties to investigate their\nevolution.\n  Method. We used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to observe the\nX-band and K-band with angular resolutions of ~1.7\" and ~0.7\", respectively,\ntoward 114 HII regions with rising-spectra between 1-5 GHz. We complement our\nobservations with VLA archival data and construct SEDs in the range of 1-26 GHz\nand model them assuming an ionization-bounded HII region with uniform density.\n  Results. Our sample has a mean electron density of ne=1.6E4cm^{-3}, diameter\ndiam=0.14pc, and emission measure EM = 1.9E7pc*cm^{-6}. We identify 16 HCHII\nregion candidates and 8 intermediate objects between the classes of HCHII and\nUCHII regions. The ne, diam, and EM change as expected, but the Lyman continuum\nflux is relatively constant over time. We find that about 67% of\nLyman-continuum photons are absorbed by dust within these HII regions and the\ndust absorption fraction tends to be more significant for more compact and\nyounger HII regions.\n  Conclusion. Young HII regions are commonly located in dusty clumps; HCHII\nregions and intermediate objects are often associated with various masers,\noutflows, broad radio recombination lines, and extended green objects, and the\naccretion at the two stages tends to be quickly reduced or halted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 20:09:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 16:51:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

However, optimizing for a specific metric reward\nleads to improvements in mostly that metric only, suggesting that the model is\ngaming the formulation of that metric in a particular way without often\nachieving real qualitative improvements. Hence, it is more beneficial to make\nthe model optimize multiple diverse metric rewards jointly. While appealing,\nthis is challenging because one needs to manually decide the importance and\nscaling weights of these metric rewards. Further, it is important to consider\nusing a dynamic combination and curriculum of metric rewards that flexibly\nchanges over time. Considering the above aspects, in our work, we automate the\noptimization of multiple metric rewards simultaneously via a multi-armed bandit\napproach (DORB), where at each round, the bandit chooses which metric reward to\noptimize next, based on expected arm gains. We use the Exp3 algorithm for\nbandits and formulate two approaches for bandit rewards: (1) Single\nMulti-reward Bandit (SM-Bandit); (2) Hierarchical Multi-reward Bandit\n(HM-Bandit). We empirically show the effectiveness of our approaches via\nvarious automatic metrics and human evaluation on two important NLG tasks:\nquestion generation and data-to-text generation, including on an unseen-test\ntransfer setup.

In our work, we assigned stability index,\npower conversion efficiency index, and cost-effectiveness index for each\nmaterial based on the available experimental data in the literature, and our\nalgorithm determined the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI2.1Br0.9/Spiro-OMeTAD as the most well\nbalanced solution in terms of cost, efficiency, and stability. The proposed\nmethod can be extended further to aid the material selection in all-perovskite\nmultijunction solar cell design as more data on perovskite materials become\navailable in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 23:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

Book genre\nclassification based on its cover would be utterly beneficial to many modern\nretrieval systems, considering that the complete digitization of books is an\nextremely expensive task. At the same time, it is also an extremely challenging\ntask due to the following reasons: First, there exists a wide variety of book\ngenres, many of which are not concretely defined. Second, book covers, as\ngraphic designs, vary in many different ways such as colors, styles, textual\ninformation, etc, even for books of the same genre. Third, book cover designs\nmay vary due to many external factors such as country, culture, target reader\npopulations, etc. With the growing competitiveness in the book industry, the\nbook cover designers and typographers push the cover designs to its limit in\nthe hope of attracting sales. The cover-based book classification systems\nbecome a particularly exciting research topic in recent years. In this paper,\nwe propose a multi-modal deep learning framework to solve this problem. The\ncontribution of this paper is four-fold. First, our method adds an extra\nmodality by extracting texts automatically from the book covers. Second,\nimage-based and text-based, state-of-the-art models are evaluated thoroughly\nfor the task of book cover classification. Third, we develop an efficient and\nsalable multi-modal framework based on the images and texts shown on the covers\nonly. Fourth, a thorough analysis of the experimental results is given and\nfuture works to improve the performance is suggested. The results show that the\nmulti-modal framework significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art\nimage-based models. However, more efforts and resources are needed for this\nclassification task in order to reach a satisfactory level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 23:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

One of the aspects that makes this problem challenging to\noptimize, is that measuring the performance of candidate configurations with\nsimulation can be computationally expensive, particularly in the post-layout\ndesign. Additionally, the large number of design constraints and the\ninteraction between the relevant quantities makes the problem complex.\nTherefore, to better facilitate supporting the human designers, it is desirable\nto gain knowledge about the whole space of feasible solutions. In order to\ntackle these challenges, we take inspiration from model-based reinforcement\nlearning and propose a method with two key properties. First, it learns a\nreward model, i.e., surrogate model of the performance approximated by neural\nnetworks, to reduce the required number of simulation. Second, it uses a\nstochastic policy generator to explore the diverse solution space satisfying\nconstraints. Together we combine these in a Dyna-style optimization framework,\nwhich we call DynaOpt, and empirically evaluate the performance on a circuit\nbenchmark of a two-stage operational amplifier.

By combining the results of self-consistent binary\nevolution calculations with population synthesis models, we find that the\ncontribution of SNe Ia in this channel is around 2.0e-4 per year. In addition,\nwe find that delay times of SNe Ia in this channel cover a range of about\n1.0-2.6 Gyr, and almost all SNe Ia produced in this way (about 97%) have a\ndelay time of > 1 Gyr. While the rate of SN Ia in this work is about 10% of the\noverall SN Ia rate, the channel represents a possible contribution to the old\npopulation (1-3 Gyr) of observed SNe Ia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 00:52:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

In this work, we propose a novel approach for the\npartitioning of k-uniform hypergraphs. Most of the existing methods work by\nreducing the hypergraph to a graph followed by applying standard graph\npartitioning algorithms. The reduction step restricts the algorithms to\ncapturing only some weighted pairwise interactions and hence loses essential\ninformation about the original hypergraph. We overcome this issue by utilizing\nthe tensor-based representation of hypergraphs, which enables us to capture\nactual super-dyadic interactions. We prove that the hypergraph to graph\nreduction is a special case of tensor contraction. We extend the notion of\nminimum ratio-cut and normalized-cut from graphs to hypergraphs and show the\nrelaxed optimization problem is equivalent to tensor eigenvalue decomposition.\nThis novel formulation also enables us to capture different ways of cutting a\nhyperedge, unlike the existing reduction approaches. We propose a hypergraph\npartitioning algorithm inspired from spectral graph theory that can accommodate\nthis notion of hyperedge cuts. We also derive a tighter upper bound on the\nminimum positive eigenvalue of even-order hypergraph Laplacian tensor in terms\nof its conductance, which is utilized in the partitioning algorithm to\napproximate the normalized cut. The efficacy of the proposed method is\ndemonstrated numerically on simple hypergraphs.

The reward can be a non-linear function of the rewards of the selected\nindividual arms. The direct use of a multi-armed bandit algorithm requires\nchoosing among $\\binom{N}{K}$ options, making the action space large. To\nsimplify the problem, existing works on combinatorial bandits {typically}\nassume feedback as a linear function of individual rewards. In this paper, we\nprove the lower bound for top-$K$ subset selection with bandit feedback with\npossibly correlated rewards. We present a novel algorithm for the combinatorial\nsetting without using individual arm feedback or requiring linearity of the\nreward function. Additionally, our algorithm works on correlated rewards of\nindividual arms. Our algorithm, aDaptive Accept RejecT (DART), sequentially\nfinds good arms and eliminates bad arms based on confidence bounds. DART is\ncomputationally efficient and uses storage linear in $N$. Further, DART\nachieves a regret bound of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(K\\sqrt{KNT})$ for a time\nhorizon $T$, which matches the lower bound in bandit feedback up to a factor of\n$\\sqrt{\\log{2NT}}$. When applied to the problem of cross-selling optimization\nand maximizing the mean of individual rewards, the performance of the proposed\nalgorithm surpasses that of state-of-the-art algorithms.

The family of 2D materials provides an\nideal platform to realize atomic-level material architectures. The wide and\nrich physics of these materials have led to fabrication of heterostructures,\nsuperlattices, and twisted structures with breakthrough discoveries and\napplications.

Observations have discovered the\ncospatial and cotemporal EBs and UV bursts, and their formation mechanisms are\nstill not clear. The multi-thermal components with a large temperature span in\nthese events challenge our understanding of magnetic reconnection and heating\nmechanisms in the low solar atmosphere. We have studied magnetic reconnection\nbetween the emerging and background magnetic fields. The initial plasma\nparameters are based on the C7 atmosphere model. After the current sheet with\ndense photosphere plasma is emerged to $0.5$ Mm above the solar surface,\nplasmoid instability appears. The plasmoids collide and coalesce with each\nother, which makes the plasmas with different densities and temperatures mixed\nup in the turbulent reconnection region. Therefore, the hot plasmas\ncorresponding to the UV emissions and colder plasmas corresponding to the\nemissions from other wavelenghts can move together and occur at about the same\nheight. In the meantime, the hot turbulent structures basically concentrate\nabove $0.4$ Mm, whereas the cool plasmas extend to much lower heights to the\nbottom of the current sheet. These phenomena are consistent with the\nobservations of Chen et al. 2019, ApJL.

The differences are significant\namong the numerical results with different resolutions, which indicate that the\nrealistic magnetic diffusivity is crucial to reveal the fine structures and\nrealistic plasmas heating in these reconnection events.

To enable\ncollaborative localization, several model-based state estimation and\nlearning-based localization methods have been developed. Given their\nencouraging performance, model-based state estimation often lacks the ability\nto model the complex relationships among multiple objects, while learning-based\nmethods are typically not able to fuse the observations from an arbitrary\nnumber of views and cannot well model uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce\na novel spatiotemporal graph filter approach that integrates graph learning and\nmodel-based estimation to perform multi-view sensor fusion for collaborative\nobject localization. Our approach models complex object relationships using a\nnew spatiotemporal graph representation and fuses multi-view observations in a\nBayesian fashion to improve location estimation under uncertainty.

Our\ntheoretical analysis allows us to precisely characterize how the test error\nvaries over different training algorithms, data distributions, problem\ndimensions as well as number of classes, inter/intra class correlations and\nclass priors. Specifically, our analysis reveals that the classification\naccuracy is highly distribution-dependent with different algorithms achieving\noptimal performance for different data distributions and/or training/features\nsizes. Unlike linear regression/binary classification, the test error in\nmulticlass classification relies on intricate functions of the trained model\n(e.g., correlation between some of the trained weights) whose asymptotic\nbehavior is difficult to characterize. This challenge is already present in\nsimple classifiers, such as those minimizing a square loss. Our novel\ntheoretical techniques allow us to overcome some of these challenges. The\ninsights gained may pave the way for a precise understanding of other\nclassification algorithms beyond those studied in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 05:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

Existing methods address this\nchallenge by treating all the un-observed data as negative (dislike) but\ndownweight the confidence of these data. However, this treatment causes two\nproblems: (1) Confidence weights of the unobserved data are usually assigned\nmanually, which lack flexibility and may create empirical bias on evaluating\nuser's preference. (2) To handle massive volume of the unobserved feedback\ndata, most of the existing methods rely on stochastic inference and data\nsampling strategies. However, since a user is only aware of a very small\nfraction of items in a large dataset, it is difficult for existing samplers to\nselect informative training instances in which the user really dislikes the\nitem rather than does not know it.\n  To address the above two problems, we propose two novel recommendation\nmethods SamWalker and SamWalker++ that support both adaptive confidence\nassignment and efficient model learning. SamWalker models data confidence with\na social network-aware function, which can adaptively specify different weights\nto different data according to users' social contexts. However, the social\nnetwork information may not be available in many recommender systems, which\nhinders application of SamWalker. Thus, we further propose SamWalker++, which\ndoes not require any side information and models data confidence with a\nconstructed pseudo-social network. We also develop fast random-walk-based\nsampling strategies for our SamWalker and SamWalker++ to adaptively draw\ninformative training instances, which can speed up gradient estimation and\nreduce sampling variance.

We\nconstruct an example of a four-dimensional cone that is nice but not amenable.\nWe also show that amenable cones are projectionally exposed in dimensions up to\nand including four.\n  We conclude with a discussion on open problems related to facial structure of\nconvex sets that we came across in the course of this work, but were not able\nto fully resolve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 06:48:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 13:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

Sociologists predominantly study such variation\nthrough the lens of social contagion, which mostly attributes cultural\nvariation to the underlying structural segregation, making it epiphenomenal to\nthe pre-existing segregated structure. On the other hand, arguing culture\ndoesn't spread like a virus, an alternative called associative diffusion was\nproposed, in which cultural transmission occurs not at the preference of\npractices, but at the association between practices. The associative diffusion\nmodel then successfully explains cultural variation without attributing it to a\nsegregated social structure. The contagion model and associative diffusion\nmodel require different types of relationships and interactions to make\ncultural transmission possible. In reality, both types of relationships exist.\nIn light of this concern, we proposed combining the two models with the\nmultilayer network framework. On one layer, agents casually observed the\nbehaviors of others, updating their belief about the association between\npractices; on another layer, agents' preference of practices are directly\ninfluenced by closed others. In the meantime, the constraint satisfaction\nbetween preference and association is used to link the update of both, thereby\nmaking each individual a coherent entity in terms of preference and\nassociation. Using this approach, we entangle the effect of social contagion\nand associative diffusion through multilayer networks. For the baseline, we\nexplore the model dynamics on three common network models: fully connected,\nsmall-world, and scale-free. The results show nontrivial dynamics between the\ntwo extremes of the contagion model and the associative diffusion model,\njustifying our claim that it is necessary to consider the two models at the\nsame time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 06:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

Local hypergraph clustering and semi-supervised learning\nspecifically involve finding a well-connected set of nodes near a given set of\nlabeled vertices. Although many methods for local clustering exist for graphs,\nthere are relatively few for localized clustering in hypergraphs. Moreover,\nthose that exist often lack flexibility to model a general class of hypergraph\ncut functions or cannot scale to large problems. To tackle these issues, this\npaper proposes a new diffusion-based hypergraph clustering algorithm that\nsolves a quadratic hypergraph cut based objective akin to a hypergraph analog\nof Andersen-Chung-Lang personalized PageRank clustering for graphs. We prove\nthat, for graphs with fixed maximum hyperedge size, this method is strongly\nlocal, meaning that its runtime only depends on the size of the output instead\nof the size of the hypergraph and is highly scalable. Moreover, our method\nenables us to compute with a wide variety of cardinality-based hypergraph cut\nfunctions.

However, recognition of overlapped speech\nremains a highly challenging task to date. To this end, multi-channel\nmicrophone array data are widely used in current ASR systems. Motivated by the\ninvariance of visual modality to acoustic signal corruption and the additional\ncues they provide to separate the target speaker from the interfering sound\nsources, this paper presents an audio-visual multi-channel based recognition\nsystem for overlapped speech. It benefits from a tight integration between a\nspeech separation front-end and recognition back-end, both of which incorporate\nadditional video input. A series of audio-visual multi-channel speech\nseparation front-end components based on TF masking, Filter&Sum and mask-based\nMVDR neural channel integration approaches are developed. To reduce the error\ncost mismatch between the separation and recognition components, the entire\nsystem is jointly fine-tuned using a multi-task criterion interpolation of the\nscale-invariant signal to noise ratio (Si-SNR) with either the connectionist\ntemporal classification (CTC), or lattice-free maximum mutual information\n(LF-MMI) loss function.

The new solution is parametrized by the scalar charge and\nthe Born-Infeld coupling constant apart from the mass and spin of the compact\nobject. Compared to the spacetime prior to the mapping, we find that the\nhigh-energy modifications at the Born-Infeld scale are able to suppress but not\nremove the curvature divergence of the original naked null singularity.\nDepending on the sign of the Born-Infeld coupling constant, these modifications\nmay even give rise to an additional timelike singularity exterior to the null\none. In spite of that, both of the naked singularities before and after the\nmapping are capable of casting shadows, and as a consequence of the mapping\nrelation, their shadows turn out to be identical as seen by a distant observer\non the equatorial plane. Even though the scalar field induces a certain\noblateness to the appearance of the shadow with its left and right endpoints\nheld fixed, the closedness condition for the shadow contour sets a small upper\nbound on the absolute value of the scalar charge, which leads to observational\nfeatures of the shadow closely resembling those of a Kerr black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 07:49:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 07:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

How\nto help users choose and recommend high-quality services among huge amounts of\nunused services has become a hot issue in research. Among the existing QoS\nprediction methods, the collaborative filtering(CF) method can only learn\nlow-dimensional linear characteristics, and its effect is limited by sparse\ndata. Although existing deep learning methods could capture high-dimensional\nnonlinear features better, most of them only use the single feature of\nidentity, and the problem of network deepening gradient disappearance is\nserious, so the effect of QoS prediction is unsatisfactory. To address these\nproblems, we propose an advanced probability distribution and location-aware\nResNet approach for QoS Prediction(PLRes). This approach considers the\nhistorical invocations probability distribution and location characteristics of\nusers and services, and first use the ResNet in QoS prediction to reuses the\nfeatures, which alleviates the problems of gradient disappearance and model\ndegradation. A series of experiments are conducted on a real-world web service\ndataset WS-DREAM.

In practice, the surgeon relies on depth-estimation skills to\nlocalize the tool-tip with respect to the retina in order to perform the\ntool-navigation task, which can be prone to human error. To alleviate such\nuncertainty, prior work has introduced ways to assist the surgeon by estimating\nthe tool-tip distance to the retina and providing haptic or auditory feedback.\nHowever, automating the tool-navigation task itself remains unsolved and\nlargely unexplored. Such a capability, if reliably automated, could serve as a\nbuilding block to streamline complex procedures and reduce the chance for\ntissue damage. Towards this end, we propose to automate the tool-navigation\ntask by learning to mimic expert demonstrations of the task. Specifically, a\ndeep network is trained to imitate expert trajectories toward various locations\non the retina based on recorded visual servoing to a given goal specified by\nthe user.

This paper provides an attempt to fill up this gap by analyzing the\nlearning guarantees of the corresponding learning algorithms on both SA and HL\nmeasures. We show that when a learning algorithm optimizes HL with its\nsurrogate loss, it enjoys an error bound for the HL measure independent of $c$\n(the number of labels), while the bound for the SA measure depends on at most\n$O(c)$. On the other hand, when directly optimizing SA with its surrogate loss,\nit has learning guarantees that depend on $O(\\sqrt{c})$ for both HL and SA\nmeasures. This explains the observation that when the label space is not large,\noptimizing HL with its surrogate loss can have promising performance for SA.

A model problem for the propagation of acoustic waves generated\nby a fixed point source in an ambient flow with constant velocity is addressed.\nBased on this result imaging functions are proposed to modify the existing KM\nand CINT functions to account for the ambient flow velocity. They are\nsubsequently tested and compared by numerical simulations in various\nconfigurations, including a synthetic turbulent jet representative of the main\nfeatures encountered in actual jet flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 09:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

We focus on two denitions of a stochastic Newton's equation called\ndierential and variational. We rst prove a stochastic virial theorem which is a\nnatural generalization of the classical case. The stochasticity modies the\nvirial relation by adding a potential term called the induced potential which\ncorresponds in quantum mechanics to the Bohm potential. Moreover, the\ndierential stochastic Newton equation naturally provides an action functional\nwhich sat-ises a stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The real part of this\nequation corresponds to the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation with an extra\npotential term corresponding to the induced potential already observed in the\nstochastic virial theorem. The induced potential has an explicit form depending\non the density of the stochastic processes solutions of the stochastic Newton\nequation. It is proved that this density satises a nonlinear Schr{\\\"o}dinger\nequation. Applying this formalism for the Kepler potential, one proves that the\ninduced potential coincides with the ad-hoc ''dark potential'' used to recover\na at rotation curve of spiral galaxies.

We find that Hill density is not a\nsufficient criterion for further gravitational collapse of a pebble cloud into\na planetesimal, but that additionally the accumulated mass has to be large\nenough to overcome turbulent diffusion. A Toomre analysis of the system\nindicates that linear self-gravity modes play no role on the scale of our\nnumerical simulation. We nevertheless find that self-gravity, by vertically\ncontracting the pebble layer, increases the strength of turbulence, which is\neither an indication of Kelvin Helmholtz Instability or a boost of the\nstreaming-instability. We furthermore determine the Bonnor-Ebert central\ndensity to which a pebble cloud of given mass has to be compressed before it\nwould be able to continue contraction against internal diffusion. As the\nequivalent \"solid body\" size of the pebble cloud scales with the central\ndensity to the power of -1/6, it is much easier to have a pebble cloud of 100\nkm equivalent size to collapse than one of 10 km for the same level of\nturbulent diffusion. This can explain the lack of small bodies in the solar\nsystem and predicts to have small objects formed by gravitational collapse at\nlarge pebble to gas ratios, in the outskirts of the solar nebula and at late\ntimes of generally reduced gas mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 10:36:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 17:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

This simple network\narchitecture is compatible with different existing SED and DOA estimation\nalgorithms. It is highly practical since the sub-networks can be improved\nindependently. The experimental results using the DCASE 2020 SELD dataset show\nthat the performances of our proposed network architecture using different SED\nand DOA estimation algorithms and different audio formats are competitive with\nother state-of-the-art SELD algorithms. The source code for the proposed SELD\nnetwork architecture is available at Github.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 10:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

The new HEVI scheme is\nimplemented in conjunction with a mixed mimetic spectral element spatial\ndiscretisation and semi-implicit vertical time stepping scheme that both\npreserve the skew-symmetric structure of the non-canonical Hamiltonian form of\nthe equations of motion. Within this context the new HEVI scheme allows for the\nexact balance of all energetic exchanges in space and time. However since the\nchoice of horizontal fluxes for which this balance is satisfied is not\nconsistent with the horizontal velocity at the end of the time level the scheme\nstill admits a temporal energy conservation error. Linearised eigenvalue\nanalysis shows that similar to a fully implicit method, the new HEVI scheme is\nneutrally stable for all buoyancy modes, and unlike a second order trapezoidal\nHEVI scheme is stable for all acoustic modes below a certain horizontal CFL\nnumber. The scheme is validated against standard test cases for both planetary\nand nonhydrostatic regimes. For the planetary scale baroclinic instability test\ncase, the new formulation exhibits a secondary oscillation in the potential to\nkinetic energy power exchanges, with a temporal frequency approximately four\ntimes that exhibited by a horizontally third order, vertically second order\ntrapezoidal scheme. For the nonhydrostatic test case, the vertical upwinding of\nthe potential temperature diagnostic equation is shown to reduce spurious\noscillations without altering the energetics of the solution, since this\nupwinding is performed in an energetically consistent manner. For this test\ncase, which is configured on an affine geometry, the exact balance of energy\nexchanges allows the model to run stably without any form of dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 10:58:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 00:33:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 00:20:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Specifically, each vertex computes its\npart in the output, the entire output is correct, but each vertex cannot\ndiscover the output of other vertices, with a certain probability. This is\nmotivated by high-performance processors that are embedded nowadays in a large\nvariety of devices. In such situations, it no longer makes sense, and in many\ncases it is not feasible, to leave the whole processing task to a single\ncomputer or even a group of central computers. As the extensive research in the\ndistributed algorithms field yielded efficient decentralized algorithms for\nmany classic problems, the discussion about the security of distributed\nalgorithms was somewhat neglected. Nevertheless, many protocols and algorithms\nwere devised in the research area of secure multi-party computation problem\n(MPC or SMC). However, the notions and terminology of these protocols are quite\ndifferent than in classic distributed algorithms. As a consequence, the focus\nin those protocols was to work for every function $f$ at the expense of\nincreasing the round complexity, or the necessity of several computational\nassumptions. In this work, we present a novel approach, which rather than\nturning existing algorithms into secure ones, identifies and develops those\nalgorithms that are inherently secure (which means they do not require any\nfurther constructions). This approach yields efficient secure algorithms for\nvarious locality problems, such as coloring, network decomposition, forest\ndecomposition, and a variety of additional labeling problems. Remarkably, our\napproach does not require any hardness assumption, but only a private\nrandomness generator in each vertex.

In\nthis work, we propose an original road in this direction, where assemblies of\nspintronic resonators used as artificial synapses can classify an-alogue\nradio-frequency signals directly without digitalization. The resonators convert\nthe ra-dio-frequency input signals into direct voltages through the spin-diode\neffect. In the process, they multiply the input signals by a synaptic weight,\nwhich depends on their resonance fre-quency. We demonstrate through physical\nsimulations with parameters extracted from exper-imental devices that\nfrequency-multiplexed assemblies of resonators implement the corner-stone\noperation of artificial neural networks, the Multiply-And-Accumulate (MAC),\ndirectly on microwave inputs. The results show that even with a non-ideal\nrealistic model, the outputs obtained with our architecture remain comparable\nto that of a traditional MAC operation.

[Contribution] As major result of our\nsurvey, we provide a meta-model of existing environment modeling concepts. As a\nnegative finding - and a research opportunity - we find that so far\nmethodological aspects of environment modeling have received very little\nattention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 12:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

It is natural to ask how much can be\ngained by running $k$ multiple random walks independently and in parallel.\nAlthough the cover time of multiple walks has been investigated for many\nnatural networks, the problem of finding a general characterisation of multiple\ncover times for worst-case start vertices (posed by Alon, Avin, Kouck\\'y,\nKozma, Lotker, and Tuttle~in 2008) remains an open problem.\n  First, we improve and tighten various bounds on the stationary cover time\nwhen $k$ random walks start from vertices sampled from the stationary\ndistribution. For example, we prove an unconditional lower bound of\n$\\Omega((n/k) \\log n)$ on the stationary cover time, holding for any $n$-vertex\ngraph $G$ and any $1 \\leq k =o(n\\log n )$. Secondly, we establish the\nstationary cover times of multiple walks on several fundamental networks up to\nconstant factors. Thirdly, we present a framework characterising worst-case\ncover times in terms of stationary cover times and a novel, relaxed notion of\nmixing time for multiple walks called the partial mixing time. Roughly\nspeaking, the partial mixing time only requires a specific portion of all\nrandom walks to be mixed. Using these new concepts, we can establish (or\nrecover) the worst-case cover times for many networks including expanders,\npreferential attachment graphs, grids, binary trees and hypercubes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 12:07:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 15:52:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 17:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

However, despite intense\nresearch efforts, data-driven quantitative modeling has not been achieved, a\nsituation mainly due to the lack of systematic experimental data and to the\nlarge number of parameters of current models.

Hadoop has become\nthe primary choice for mainstream platforms used by stakeholders to process big\ndata. Thereafter, the security of Hadoop platform has arisen tremendous\nattention worldwide. In this paper, we mainly concentrate on enforcing access\ncontrol on users to ensure platform security. First, we leverage access proxy\nintegrated with attribute-based access control (ABAC) model to implement\nfront-end authorization, which can fully reflect and cope with the flexible\nnature of the complex access control process in Hadoop platform, as well as can\nrelease back-end resources from complex authorization process through access\nproxy. Moreover, in order to ensure the fine-granularity of authorization, the\naccess proxy maintains a list composed of trust threshold value provided by\neach resource according to its importance. The access proxy interacts with the\nblockchain network to obtain the user's trust evaluation value, which serves as\nan important basis for dynamic authorization determination. More specifically,\nblockchain network works together on-chain and off-chain modes. The user's\nhistorical behavior data is stored off-chain, and the corresponding hash value\nis anchored on-chain. Consequently, the user's trust value is evaluated based\non his historical behavior stored on the blockchain platform. Meanwhile, the\nauthenticity of user behavior data can be guaranteed, thereby ensuring the\nreliability of trust assessment results. Our experiment demonstrates that the\nproposed model can dynamically and flexibly adjust user permissions to ensure\nthe security of the platform, while time and money are consumed within a\nreasonable range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 12:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

To manifest the effect of Rayleigh's curse on quantum parameter\nestimation, we define the curse matrix in terms of quantum Fisher information\nand introduce the global and local immunity to the curse accordingly.

We review the basic idea, the tools that have been developed as well\nas the resulting theories in which successful reduction of couplings has been\nachieved so far.

We\nanalyse high-resolution spectra of RZ Cas that we obtained during a\nspectroscopic long-term monitoring lasting from 2001 to 2017. Spectrum analysis\nresulted in precise atmospheric parameters of both components, in particular in\nsurface abundances below solar values. We find that the variation of orbital\nperiod is semi-regular and derive different characteristic timescales for\ndifferent epochs of observation. We show that the radial velocity variations\nwith orbital phase can be modelled when including two cool spots on the surface\nof the secondary component. The modelling leads to precise masses and\nseparation of the components. The seasonal variation of several parameters,\nsuch as vsin(i), rotation-orbit synchronisation factor, strength of the spots\non the cool companion, and orbital period, can be characterised by a common\ntimescale of the order of nine years. We interpret the timescale of nine years\nas the magnetic activity cycle of the cool companion. In particular the\nbehaviour of the dark spots on the cool companion leads us to the\ninterpretation that this timescale is based on an 18-year magnetic dynamo\ncycle. We conclude that the mass-transfer rate is controlled by the variable\ndepth of the Wilson depression in the magnetic spot around the Lagrangian point\nL1. In the result, based on available data, we observe a damped activity cycle\nof the star, starting with a high mass-transfer episode around 2001, followed\nby quiet periods in 2006 and 2009, slightly higher activity around 2013 and\n2014, and again followed by quiet periods in 2015 and 2016. However, owing to\nmissing data for years 2010 and 2011, we cannot exclude that a second high\nmass-transfer episode occurred within this time span.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 12:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

Nevertheless, a limited onboard\nbattery greatly hinders UAV to prolong the serving time from communication\ntasks that need a high power consumption in active RF communications.\nFortunately, caching and backscatter communication (BackCom) are appealing\ntechnology for energy efficient communication systems. This motivates us to\ninvestigate a wireless communication network with backscatter- and\ncache-assisted UAV technology. We assume a UAV with a cache memory is deployed\nas a flying backscatter device (BD), term the UAV-enabled BD (UB), to relay the\nsource's signals to the destination. Besides, the UAV can harvest energy from\nthe source's RF signals and then utilizes it for backscattering information to\nthe destination.

Both assume that the optimal action to play is\ncontingent on an underlying changing state which is not directly observable by\nthe agent. They differ in what kind of side information can be used to estimate\nthis state. The first one considers each state to be associated with a context,\npossibly corrupted, allowing the agent to learn the context-to-state mapping.\nThe second one considers that the state itself evolves in a Markovian fashion,\nthus allowing the agent to estimate the current state based on history. We\nargue that it is realistic for the agent to have access to both these sources\nof information, i.e., an arbitrarily corrupted context obeying the Markov\nproperty. Thus, the agent is faced with a new challenge of balancing its belief\nabout the reliability of information from learned state transitions versus\ncontext information. We present an algorithm that uses a referee to dynamically\ncombine the policies of a contextual bandit and a multi-armed bandit. We\ncapture the time-correlation of states through iteratively learning the\naction-reward transition model, allowing for efficient exploration of actions.\nUsers transition through different unobserved, time-correlated but only\npartially observable internal states, which determine their current needs.

Here we report the first discovery of three O-type stars in\nthe Bridge using archival spectra collected with FLAMES at ESO/VLT. We analyze\nthe spectra using the PoWR models, which provide the physical parameters,\nionizing photon fluxes, and surface abundances. This discovery suggests that\nthe tidally stripped low density gas is capable of producing massive O stars\nand their ages imply ongoing star formation in the Bridge. The multi-epoch\nspectra indicate that all three O stars are binaries. Despite their spatial\nproximity to each other, these O stars are chemically distinct. One of them is\na fast-rotating giant with nearly LMC-like abundances. The other two are\nmain-sequence stars that rotate extremely slowly and are strongly metal\ndepleted. This includes the most nitrogen-poor O star known up to date. Taking\ninto account the previous analyses of B stars in the Bridge, we interpret the\nvarious metal abundances as the signature of a chemically inhomogeneous\ninterstellar medium, suggesting that the gas might have accreted during\nmultiple episodes of tidal interaction between the Clouds. Attributing the\nlowest derived metal content to the primordial gas, the time of initial\nformation of the Bridge may date back to several Gyr. Using the Gaia and Galex\ncolor-magnitude diagrams we roughly estimate the total number of O stars in the\nBridge and their total ionizing radiation. Comparing with the energetics of the\ndiffuse ISM, we find that the contribution of the hot stars to the ionizing\nradiation field in the Bridge is less than 10%, and conclude that the main\nsources of ionizing photons are leaks from the LMC and SMC. We estimate a lower\nlimit for the fraction of ionizing radiation that escapes from these two dwarf\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 14:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Due to the lack of\nground truth bounding boxes, class labels are mainly employed to train the\nmodel. This model generates a class activation map (CAM) which activates the\nmost discriminate features. However, the main drawback of CAM is the ability to\ndetect just a part of the object. To solve this problem, some researchers have\nremoved parts from the detected object \\cite{b1, b2, b4}, or the image\n\\cite{b3}. The aim of removing parts from image or detected parts of the object\nis to force the model to detect the other features. However, these methods\nrequire one or many hyper-parameters to erase the appropriate pixels on the\nimage, which could involve a loss of information. In contrast, this paper\nproposes a Hierarchical Complementary Learning Network method (HCLNet) that\nhelps the CNN to perform better classification and localization of objects on\nthe images. HCLNet uses a complementary map to force the network to detect the\nother parts of the object.

To every state\nwe associate the vector of its expected charge values and its entropy, forming\nthe phase diagram of the system. Our fundamental result is the Asymptotic\nEquivalence Theorem (AET), which allows us to identify the equivalence classes\nof states under asymptotic approximately charge-conserving unitaries with the\npoints of the phase diagram.\n  Using the phase diagram of a system and its bath, we analyze the first and\nthe second laws of thermodynamics. In particular, we show that to attain the\nsecond law, an asymptotically large bath is necessary. In the case that the\nbath is composed of several identical copies of the same elementary bath, we\nquantify exactly how large the bath has to be to permit a specified work\ntransformation of a given system, in terms of the number of copies of the\nelementary bath systems per work system (bath rate). If the bath is relatively\nsmall, we show that the analysis requires an extended phase diagram exhibiting\nnegative entropies. This corresponds to the purely quantum effect that at the\nend of the process, system and bath are entangled, thus permitting classically\nimpossible transformations. For a large bath, system and bath may be left\nuncorrelated and we show that the optimal bath rate, as a function of how\ntightly the second law is attained, can be expressed in terms of the heat\ncapacity of the bath.\n  Our approach solves a problem from earlier investigations about how to store\nthe different charges under optimal work extraction protocols in physically\nseparate batteries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 15:16:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 13:24:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 13:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

In this paper, we learn such a module while being conscious of\nthe difficulties in obtaining large paired 2D-3D datasets. By leveraging\ngenerative domain translation methods, we are able to define a learning\nalgorithm that requires only weak supervision, with unpaired data.

In quantum systems with more than\ntwo subsystems, there are more trade-off relations, due to the various\ndecomposition ways of the coherence. In this paper, we experimentally verify\nthese coherence trade-off relations in adiabatically evolved quantum systems\nusing a spin system by changing the state from a product state to a tripartite\nentangled state. We study the full set of coherence trade-off relations between\nthe original state, the bipartite product state, the tripartite product state,\nand the decohered product state.

An\non-cycle breaks the stimuli-sensitive bonds connecting both the blocks A and B\nin BCP melt, and during the off-cycle, broken bonds reconnect.

For this purpose, it\nis often assumed that one must deal with known probabilistic obstacles, then\ncompute the probability of collision with each obstacle. However, in complex\nscenarios or unstructured environments, it might be difficult to detect such\nobstacles. In these cases, a metric map is used, where each position stores the\ninformation of occupancy. The most common type of metric map is the Bayesian\noccupancy map. However, this type of map is not well suited for computing risk\nassessments for continuous paths due to its discrete nature. Hence, we\nintroduce a novel type of map called the Lambda Field, which is specially\ndesigned for risk assessment. We first propose a way to compute such a map and\nthe expectation of a generic risk over a path. Then, we demonstrate the\nbenefits of our generic formulation with a use case defining the risk as the\nexpected collision force over a path. Using this risk definition and the Lambda\nField, we show that our framework is capable of doing classical path planning\nwhile having a physical-based metric. Furthermore, the Lambda Field gives a\nnatural way to deal with unstructured environments, such as tall grass. Where\nstandard environment representations would always generate trajectories going\naround such obstacles, our framework allows the robot to go through the grass\nwhile being aware of the risk taken.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 15:52:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 14:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

The latter concerns a diffusive search process in\nwhich the targets are much smaller than the size of the search domain. The\nsmall target assumption allows us to use matched asymptotic expansions and\nGreen's functions to solve the diffusion equation in Laplace space. In\nparticular, we derive an asymptotic expansion of the Laplace transformed flux\ninto each target in powers of the non-dimensionalized target size $\\epsilon$.\nOne major advantage of working directly with fluxes is that one can generate\nstatistical quantities such as splitting probabilities and conditional first\npassage time moments without having to solve a separate boundary value problem\nin each case. However, in order to derive asymptotic expansions of these\nquantities, it is necessary to eliminate Green's function singularities that\narise in the limit $s\\rightarrow 0$, where $s$ is the Laplace variable. We\nachieve this by considering a triple expansion in $\\epsilon$, $s$ and\n$\\Lambda\\sim \\epsilon /s$.

Methods 20 Different cementless femoral stem\nwere impacted into five bovine femur samples, leading to 99 configurations.\nThree methods were used to quantify the insertion endpoint: the impact hammer,\nvideo motion tracking and the surgeon proprioception. For each configuration,\nthe number of impacts performed by the surgeon until he felt a correct\ninsertion was noted Nsurg. The insertion depth E was measured through video\nmotion tracking, and the impact number Nvid corresponding to the end of the\ninsertion was estimated.

In this\npaper, we develop an interpretable dimension reduction approach called\nRegularized Higher Order Principal Components Analysis, as well as an extension\nto Regularized Higher Order Partial Least Squares, that allows neuroscientists\nto explore and visualize ECoG data. Our approach employs a sparse and\nfunctional Candecomp-Parafac (CP) decomposition that incorporates sparsity to\nselect relevant electrodes and frequency bands, as well as smoothness over time\nand frequency, yielding directly interpretable factors. We demonstrate the\nperformance and interpretability of our method with an ECoG case study on audio\nand visual processing of human speech.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 18:19:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 01:52:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 19:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

The conventional techniques to solve such NP-hard\ncombinatorial optimization problem involves multiple complex models and\nrequires tedious tuning of parameters, failing to provide an acceptable\nperformance within the computational constraints. This paper proposes a model\nfree end-to-end approach for airborne target tracking system using sensor\nmeasurements, integrating all the key elements of multi target tracking --\nassociation, prediction and filtering using deep learning with memory. The\nchallenging task of association is performed using the Bi-Directional Long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) whereas filtering and prediction are done using LSTM\nmodels. The proposed modular blocks can be independently trained and used in\nmultitude of tracking applications including non co-operative (e.g., radar) and\nco-operative sensors (e.g., AIS, IFF, ADS-B).

Our aim is not to develop another\nmetaheuristic method but to investigate two practically important yet rarely\nstudied issues: (i) whether existing results are already globally optimal; (ii)\nwhether a significantly simpler metaheuristic can achieve equally good\nperformance. We take the two widely used I-V curve datasets for case studies.\nThe first issue is addressed using a branch and bound algorithm, which\ncertifies the global minimum rigorously or locates a fairly tight upper bound,\ndespite its intolerable slowness. These values are useful references for fair\nevaluation and further development of metaheuristics. Next, extensive\nexamination and comparison reveal that, perhaps surprisingly, an elementary\ndifferential evolution (DE) algorithm can either attain the global minimum\ncertified above or obtain the best-known result. More attractively, the simple\nDE algorithm takes only a fraction of the runtime of state-of-the-art\nmetaheuristic methods and is particularly preferable in time-sensitive\napplications. This novel, unusual, and notable finding also indicates that the\nemployment of increasingly complicated metaheuristics might be somewhat\noverkilling for regular PV parameter estimation. Finally, we discuss the\nimplications of these results for future research and suggest the simple DE\nmethod as the first choice for industrial applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 07:33:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2021 16:19:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 12:35:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2023 10:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

While most\nexisting techniques focus on extracting either the whole set of contrast\npatterns (CPs) or minimal sets, the problem of efficiently finding a relevant\nsubset of CPs, especially in high dimensional datasets, is an open challenge.\nIn this paper, we focus on extracting the most specific set of CPs to discover\nsignificant changes between two datasets. Our approach to this problem uses\nclosed patterns to substantially reduce redundant patterns. Our experimental\nresults on several real and emulated network traffic datasets demonstrate that\nour proposed unsupervised algorithm is up to 100 times faster than an existing\napproach for CPM on network traffic data [2]. In addition, as an application of\nCPs, we demonstrate that CPM is a highly effective method for detection of\nmeaningful changes in network traffic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 08:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

Pedestrians often exhibit a wide range\nof behaviors and adequate interpretations of those depend on various sources of\ninformation such as pedestrian appearance, states of other road users, the\nenvironment layout, etc. To address this problem, we propose a novel\nmulti-modal prediction algorithm that incorporates different sources of\ninformation captured from the environment to predict future crossing actions of\npedestrians. The proposed model benefits from a hybrid learning architecture\nconsisting of feedforward and recurrent networks for analyzing visual features\nof the environment and dynamics of the scene.
