It is well known that weighted PFs suffer from the weight\ndegeneracy and curse of dimensionality. To sidestep these issues, unweighted\nPFs have been gaining attention, though they have their own challenges. The\nexisting literature on these types of PFs is based on distinct approaches. In\norder to establish a connection, we put forward a framework that unifies\nweighted and unweighted PFs in the continuous-time filtering problem. We show\nthat the stochastic dynamics of a particle system described by a pair process,\nrepresenting particles and their importance weights, should satisfy two\nnecessary conditions in order for its distribution to match the solution of the\nKushner--Stratonovich equation. In particular, we demonstrate that the\nbootstrap particle filter (BPF), which relies on importance sampling, and the\nfeedback particle filter (FPF), which is an unweighted PF based on optimal\ncontrol, arise as special cases from a broad class and that there is a smooth\ntransition between the two.

For instance, flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), the most\npowerful jets, manage to accelerate to high bulk Lorentz factor, as observed in\nthe radio. As a result, the emission region will have a rather modest\nmagnetization which will induce a steep particle spectra therein and a rather\nsteep emission spectra in the gamma-rays; particularly in the\n\\textit{Fermi}-LAT band. For the weaker jets, namely BL Lacertae objects (BL\nLacs), the opposite holds true; i.e., the jet does not achieve a very high bulk\nLorentz factor, leading to more magnetic energy available for non-thermal\nparticle acceleration and harder emission spectra. Moreover, this model\nrequires but a handful of parameters. By means of numerical simulations we have\naccomplished to reproduce the spectral energy distributions and light-curves\nfrom fiducial sources following the aforementioned model.

Compared with UWF fundus images, regular fundus images contain a large\namount of high-quality and well-annotated data. Due to the domain gap, models\ntrained by regular fundus images to recognize UWF fundus images perform poorly.\nHence, given that annotating medical data is labor intensive and time\nconsuming, in this paper, we explore how to leverage regular fundus images to\nimprove the limited UWF fundus data and annotations for more efficient\ntraining. We propose the use of a modified cycle generative adversarial network\n(CycleGAN) model to bridge the gap between regular and UWF fundus and generate\nadditional UWF fundus images for training. A consistency regularization term is\nproposed in the loss of the GAN to improve and regulate the quality of the\ngenerated data. Our method does not require that images from the two domains be\npaired or even that the semantic labels be the same, which provides great\nconvenience for data collection. Furthermore, we show that our method is robust\nto noise and errors introduced by the generated unlabeled data with the\npseudo-labeling technique.

We find\nthat the abundance of most elements can be predicted from age and [Fe/H] with\nan intrinsic scatter of about 0.03 dex. We discuss the possible causes for the\nexistence of the abundance-age-metallicity relations. Using a stochastic\nchemical enrichment scheme based on the size of Supernovae remnants, we show\nthe intrinsic scatter is expected to be small, about 0.05 dex or even smaller\nif there is additional mixing in the ISM. Elemental abundances show trends with\nboth age and metallicity and the relationship is well described by a simple\nmodel in which the dependence of abundance ([X/Fe]) on age and [Fe/H] are\nadditively separable. Elements can be grouped based on the direction of their\nabundance gradient in the (age,[Fe/H]) plane and different groups can be\nroughly associated with three distinct nucleosynthetic production sites, the\nexploding massive stars, the exploding white dwarfs and the AGB stars. However,\nthe abundances of some elements, like Co, La, and Li, show large scatter for a\ngiven age and metallicity, suggesting processes other than simple Galactic\nchemical evolution are at play. We also compare the abundance trends of\nmain-sequence turn-off stars against that of giants, whose ages were estimated\nusing asteroseismic information from the K2 mission. For most elements, the\ntrends of main-sequence turn-off stars are similar to that of giants. The\nexistence of abundance relations implies that we can estimate the age and birth\nradius of disc stars, which is important for studying the dynamic and chemical\nevolution of the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 16:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

Here, ab initio calculations show that intercalating Li at a\nMoS2-hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) interface stabilizes the 1T phase over the\n2H phase of MoS2 by ~ 100 mJ m-2, suggesting that encapsulating MoS2 with hBN\nmay lower the electrochemical energy needed for the intercalation-induced phase\ntransition.

The paper proposes Decoder-end Adaptive\nComputation Steps (DACS) algorithm to address the issue of latency and\nfacilitate online ASR. The proposed algorithm streams the decoding of\nTransformer ASR by triggering an output after the confidence acquired from the\nencoder states reaches a certain threshold. Unlike other monotonic attention\nmechanisms that risk visiting the entire encoder states for each output step,\nthe paper introduces a maximum look-ahead step into the DACS algorithm to\nprevent from reaching the end of speech too fast. A Chunkwise encoder is\nadopted in our system to handle real-time speech inputs. The proposed online\nTransformer ASR system has been evaluated on Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and\nAIShell-1 datasets, yielding 5.5% word error rate (WER) and 7.1% character\nerror rate (CER) respectively, with only a minor decay in performance when\ncompared to the offline systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 17:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

First, we studied whether the explicit treatment\nof dielectric media as polar beads instead of homogeneous dielectric background\nresults in a different system behavior. We showed that the explicit treatment\nof polar beads facilitates the chain collapse, i.e. it occurs at smaller values\nof the electrostatic strength parameter values ${\\lambda}^2 \\sim\nQ^2/({\\epsilon}kT)$. We believe that the main reason for such behavior is that\nthe dielectric response is in fact a collective effect, and the \"effective\"\ndielectric permittivity is different from the bulk value when the charges are\nclose to each other and/or the density of the charges is high enough. This\nimplies that the value of ${\\lambda}$ does not have a universal meaning due to\nthe small-scale effects related to the presence of polar species; therefore,\nchanging the total unit charge $Q$ or the temperature $kT$ is not equivalent to\nchanging ${\\epsilon}$. Next, we investigated how the difference of the\ndielectric permittivities of the polymer chain and solvent affects the\ncollapse. We showed the polar chain adapts less swollen conformations in the\npolyelectrolyte regime and collapses easier compared to the case of non-polar\nchain; the possible reasons for such behavior are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 17:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

As a result, a large variety of\ntheoretical models have been proposed to relieve this tension. In this work we\nanalyze a conformally-coupled modified gravity (CCMG) model of an evolving\ngravitational constant due to the coupling of a scalar field to the Ricci\nscalar, which becomes active around matter-radiation equality, as required for\nsolutions to the Hubble tension based on increasing the sound horizon at\nrecombination. The model is theoretically advantageous as it has only one free\nparameter in addition to the baseline $\\Lambda$CDM ones. Inspired by similar\nrecent analyses of so-called early-dark-energy models, we constrain the CCMG\nmodel using a combination of early and late-Universe cosmological datasets. In\naddition to the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and\nweak lensing measurements, baryon acoustic oscillations and the Supernova H0\nfor the Equation of State datasets, we also use large-scale structure (LSS)\ndatasets such as the Dark Energy Survey year 1 and the full-shape power\nspectrum likelihood from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, including\nits recent analysis using effective field theory, to check the effect of the\nCCMG model on the (milder) S8 tension between the CMB and LSS. We find that the\nCCMG model can slightly relax the Hubble tension, with $H_0 = 69.6 \\pm 1.6$\nkm/s/Mpc at 95% CL, while barely affecting the S8 tension. However, current\ndata does not exhibit strong preference for CCMG over the standard cosmological\nmodel. Lastly, we show that the planned CMB-S4 experiment will have the\nsensitivity required to distinguish between the CCMG model and the more general\nclass of models involving an evolving gravitational constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 17:30:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 10:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

Recently, a novel figure of merit for resonance classification has\nbeen proposed 1 and its applicability was demonstrated mostly to toy model\nsystems. This novel measure, the energy-based plasmonicity index (EPI),\ncharacterizes the nature of resonances in molecular nanostructures. The EPI\ndistinguishes between either a single-particle-like or a plasmonic nature of\nresonances based on the energy space coherence dynamics of the excitation. To\nadvance the further development of this newly established measure, we present\nhere its exemplary application to characterize the resonances of graphene\nnanoantennas.

We have re-evaluated the thermal rate\nfor this reaction, using a world average of cross section data, which we\ndescribe with model-independent polynomials; our results are in good agreement\nwith a similar analysis by LUNA. We then perform a full likelihood analysis\ncombining BBN and Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) likelihood chains\nusing the new rate combined with previous measurements and compare with the\nresults using previous rates. Concordance between BBN and CMB measurements of\nthe anisotropy spectrum using the old rates was excellent.

The DeLLight (Deflection of Light by Light) experiment aims to\nobserve the optically-induced index change of vacuum, a nonlinear effect which\nhas never been explored. The experiment is installed in the LASERIX facility at\nIJCLab, which delivers ultra-short intense laser pulses (2.5 J per pulse, each\nof 30 fs duration, with a 10 Hz repetition rate). The proposal is to measure\nthe refraction of a probe laser pulse when crossing a transverse vacuum index\ngradient, produced by a very intense pump pulse. The refraction induces a\ntransverse shift in the intensity profile of the probe, whose signal is\namplified by a Sagnac interferometer.

Given the vast amount of available data nowadays, many\napplications constrain storage and/or bandwidth to work efficiently. To satisfy\nthese constraints, many applications compress a scene representation by\nreducing its number of 3D points. While state-of-the-art methods use\n$K$-cover-based algorithms to compress a scene, they are slow and hard to tune.\nTo enhance speed and facilitate parameter tuning, this work introduces a novel\napproach that compresses a scene representation by means of a constrained\nquadratic program (QP). Because this QP resembles a one-class support vector\nmachine, we derive a variant of the sequential minimal optimization to solve\nit. Our approach uses the points corresponding to the support vectors as the\nsubset of points to represent a scene. We also present an efficient\ninitialization method that allows our method to converge quickly.

To reduce annotation effort, we present TREBA: a\nmethod to learn annotation-sample efficient trajectory embedding for behavior\nanalysis, based on multi-task self-supervised learning.

These features in the free-energy\nlandscape are primarily the result of ion dehydration and electrostatic\ninteractions. For pores in atomically thin membranes, such as graphene, other\nfactors come into play. Ion dynamics both inside and outside the geometric\nvolume of the pore can be critical in determining the transport properties of\nthe channel due to several commensurate length scales, such as the effective\nmembrane thickness, radii of the first and the second hydration layers, pore\nradius, and Debye length. In particular, for biomimetic pores, such as the\ngraphene crown ether we examine here, there are regimes where transport is\nhighly sensitive to the pore size due to the interplay of dehydration and\ninteraction with pore charge. Picometer changes in the size, e.g., due to a\nminute strain, can lead to a large change in conductance. Outside of these\nregimes, the small pore size itself gives a large resistance, even when\nelectrostatic factors and dehydration compensate each other to give a\nrelatively flat -- e.g., near barrierless -- free energy landscape. The\npermeability, though, can still be large and ions will translocate rapidly\nafter they arrive within the capture radius of the pore. This, in turn, leads\nto diffusion and drift effects dominating the conductance. The current thus\nplateaus and becomes effectively independent of pore-free energy\ncharacteristics. Measurement of this effect will give an estimate of the\nmagnitude of kinetically limiting features, and experimentally constrain the\nlocal electromechanical conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

In a SuperCDMS HVeV 2020 run,\nCherenkov photons produced in printed-circuit-boards located near the sensor\nlikely explain the origin of most of the events containing 2 to 6 electrons. At\nSuperCDMS SNOLAB, radioactive contaminants inside the Cirlex located inside or\non the copper side walls of their detectors will produce many Cherenkov\nphotons, which could dominate the low-energy backgrounds. For the EDELWEISS\nexperiment, Cherenkov or luminescence backgrounds are subdominant to their\nobserved event rate, but could still limit the sensitivity of their future\nsearches. We also point out that Cherenkov radiation, transition radiation, and\nrecombination could be a significant source of backgrounds at future\nexperiments aiming to detect dark-matter via scintillation or phonon signals.\nWe also discuss the implications of our results for the development of\nsuperconducting qubits and low-threshold searches for coherent neutrino\nscattering, and comment on design strategies that can be implemented to\nmitigate these backgrounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 18:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-18"}

This is the\nfirst time that the effect of magnetic fields in major mergers has been\ninvestigated in a cosmologically-consistent manner. In contrast to previous\nnon-cosmological simulations, we find that the inclusion of magnetic fields has\na substantial impact on the production of the merger remnant.

However, despite achieving an\nunprecedented level of photorealism on the generated images, NeRF is only\napplicable to static scenes, where the same spatial location can be queried\nfrom different images. In this paper we introduce D-NeRF, a method that extends\nneural radiance fields to a dynamic domain, allowing to reconstruct and render\nnovel images of objects under rigid and non-rigid motions from a \\emph{single}\ncamera moving around the scene. For this purpose we consider time as an\nadditional input to the system, and split the learning process in two main\nstages: one that encodes the scene into a canonical space and another that maps\nthis canonical representation into the deformed scene at a particular time.\nBoth mappings are simultaneously learned using fully-connected networks. Once\nthe networks are trained, D-NeRF can render novel images, controlling both the\ncamera view and the time variable, and thus, the object movement.

However, this is not true if the adversary gains\ncontrol of the client and can therefore manipulate what the user sees and what\nis sent to the remote server.\n  To protect the user's communication with the remote server despite a\npotentially compromised local client, we propose the concept of continuous\nvisual supervision by a second device equipped with a camera. Motivated by the\nrapid increase of the number of incoming devices with front-facing cameras,\nsuch as augmented reality headsets and smart home assistants, we build upon the\ncore idea that the user's actual intended input is what is shown on the\nclient's screen, despite what ends up being sent to the remote server. A\nstatically positioned camera enabled device can, therefore, continuously\nanalyze the client's screen to enforce that the client behaves honestly despite\npotentially being malicious.\n  We evaluate the present-day feasibility and deployability of this concept by\ndeveloping a fully functional prototype, running a host of experimental tests\non three different mobile devices, and by conducting a user study in which we\nanalyze participants' use of the system during various simulated attacks.\nExperimental evaluation indeed confirms the feasibility of the concept of\nvisual supervision, given that the system consistently detects over 98% of\nevaluated attacks, while study participants with little instruction detect the\nremaining attacks with high probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 20:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

To address such challenges, this paper first introduces a novel\nstate-dependent Markov channel (SD-MC) model that explicitly captures the\nstate-dependent features of industrial wireless communication systems by\ndefining the proposed model's transition probabilities as a function of both\nits environment's states and transmission power.

The model includes spherical,\nconstant-size hazes particles that gravitationally settle and are transported\nby the winds as passive tracers, with particle radii ranging from 1 nm to 300\n$\\mu$m. We identify two general types of haze distribution based on particle\nsize: In the small-particle regime (<30 nm), gravitational settling is\nunimportant, and hazes accumulate in two large mid-latitude vortices centered\non the night side that extend across the morning terminator. Therefore, small\nhazes are more concentrated at the morning terminator than at the evening\nterminator. In the large-particle regime (>30 nm), hazes settle out quickly on\nthe nightside, resulting in more hazes at the evening terminator. For small\nparticles, terminator differences in haze mass mixing ratio and temperature\nconsidered individually can result in significant differences in the transit\nspectra of the terminators. When combining both effects for HD189733b, however,\nthey largely cancel out each other, resulting in very small terminator\ndifferences in the spectra.

This migration has been linked to an\nearly instability in the orbits of the giant planets and the formation of the\nKuiper belt itself, from an ancestral trans-Neptunian planetesimal disk that\nincluded Pluto. Pluto-Charon is emblematic of what are now recognized as small\nor dwarf planets.

Pluto may have inherited a large organic\nmass fraction during accretion, which may responsible, in part, for its surface\nand atmospheric volatiles. Charon, Pluto's major moon, displays evidence of\nextensive early tectonism and cryovolcanism.

If we can better\nunderstand the differences between human and machine perception, we can\npotentially characterize and mitigate this effect. We therefore propose a\nframework for comparing human and machine perception in medical diagnosis. The\ntwo are compared with respect to their sensitivity to the removal of clinically\nmeaningful information, and to the regions of an image deemed most suspicious.\nDrawing inspiration from the natural image domain, we frame both comparisons in\nterms of perturbation robustness. The novelty of our framework is that separate\nanalyses are performed for subgroups with clinically meaningful differences. We\nargue that this is necessary in order to avert Simpson's paradox and draw\ncorrect conclusions. We demonstrate our framework with a case study in breast\ncancer screening, and reveal significant differences between radiologists and\nDNNs. We compare the two with respect to their robustness to Gaussian low-pass\nfiltering, performing a subgroup analysis on microcalcifications and soft\ntissue lesions. For microcalcifications, DNNs use a separate set of high\nfrequency components than radiologists, some of which lie outside the image\nregions considered most suspicious by radiologists. These features run the risk\nof being spurious, but if not, could represent potential new biomarkers. For\nsoft tissue lesions, the divergence between radiologists and DNNs is even\nstarker, with DNNs relying heavily on spurious high frequency components\nignored by radiologists. Importantly, this deviation in soft tissue lesions was\nonly observable through subgroup analysis, which highlights the importance of\nincorporating medical domain knowledge into our comparison framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2020 00:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

Karlovitz numbers upto 76 are examined.\nIt is shown that, by increasing the turbulence intensity, the preheat and\nreaction zone thicknesses can increase to values that are, respectively, 6.3\nand 4.9 of the corresponding laminar flames. Broadening of these zones for\nintensely turbulent hydrogen-enriched methane-air flames is shown\nexperimentally for the first time. Broadening of the reaction zone suggests\nthat the flamelet assumption used for development of the burning rate\nformulations may not hold. Thus, a new formulation, which does not utilize the\nflamelet assumption, is developed and used to calculate the burning rate of the\ntested flames.

While it has attracted much research interest, its exact latency and\nsecurity properties remain open. Existing analyses provide security and latency\n(or confirmation time) guarantees that are too loose for practical use. In fact\nthe best known upper bounds are several orders of magnitude larger than a lower\nbound due to a well-known private-mining attack. This paper describes a\ncontinuous-time model for blockchains and develops a rigorous analysis that\nyields close upper and lower bounds for the latency--security trade-off. For\nexample, when the adversary controls 10\\% of the total mining power and the\nblock propagation delays are within 10 seconds, a Bitcoin block is secured with\nless than $10^{-3}$ error probability if it is confirmed after four hours, or\nwith less than $10^{-9}$ error probability if confirmed after ten hours. These\nconfirmation times are about two hours away from their corresponding lower\nbounds.

The results show\nthat the lift-off height is underestimated and the reactive scalars (e.g.\ntemperature, H2 and OH) are over-predicted with coarser CMC mesh.

The time sequences of the most reactive and stoichiometric OH mass\nfractions indicate that finer CMC mesh can capture more unsteady details than\ncoarser CMC mesh.

The risk of\ninfection in indoor environments is typically modelled using the Wells-Riley\nmodel or a Wells-Riley-like formulation, usually assuming the pathogen dose\nfollows a Poisson distribution (mono-pathogen assumption). Aerosols that hold\nmore than one pathogen copy, i.e. poly-pathogen aerosols, break this assumption\neven if the aerosol dose itself follows a Poisson distribution. For the largest\naerosols where the number of pathogen in each aerosol can sometimes be several\nhundred or several thousand, the effect is non-negligible, especially in\ndiseases where the risk of infection per pathogen is high. Here we report on a\ngeneralization of the Wells-Riley model and dose-response models for\npoly-pathogen aerosols by separately modeling each number of pathogen copies\nper aerosol, while the aerosol dose itself follows a Poisson distribution. This\nresults in a model for computational risk assessment suitable for\nmono-/poly-pathogen aerosols. We show that the mono-pathogen assumption\nsignificantly overestimates the risk of infection for high pathogen\nconcentrations in the respiratory tract fluid.

It\nturns out, somewhat surprisingly, that this is not the case even for the most\nstandard algorithms that minimize the empirical risk. Non-monotonic behavior of\nthe risk and instability in training have manifested and appeared in the\npopular deep learning paradigm under the description of double descent. These\nproblems highlight the current lack of understanding of learning algorithms and\ngeneralization. It is, therefore, crucial to pursue this concern and provide a\ncharacterization of such behavior. In this paper, we derive the first\nconsistent and risk-monotonic (in high probability) algorithms for a general\nstatistical learning setting under weak assumptions, consequently answering\nsome questions posed by Viering et al. 2019 on how to avoid non-monotonic\nbehavior of risk curves.

However, for practical utility and deployment of\nlow-light enhancement algorithms on edge devices such as embedded systems,\nsurveillance cameras, autonomous robots and smartphones, the solution must\nrespect additional constraints such as limited GPU memory and processing power.\nWith this in mind, we propose a deep neural network architecture that aims to\nstrike a balance between the network latency, memory utilization, model\nparameters, and reconstruction quality. The key idea is to forbid computations\nin the High-Resolution (HR) space and limit them to a Low-Resolution (LR)\nspace. However, doing the bulk of computations in the LR space causes artifacts\nin the restored image. We thus propose Pack and UnPack operations, which allow\nus to effectively transit between the HR and LR spaces without incurring much\nartifacts in the restored image.

The order reduction\ntechniques presented here are based on the Lyapunov-Perrone (L-P)\nTransformation. For a class of non-resonant quasi-periodic systems, the L-P\ntransformation can convert a linear quasi-periodic system into a linear\ntime-invariant one. This Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system retains the\ndynamics of the original quasi-periodic system. Once this LTI system is\nobtained, the tools and techniques available for analysis of LTI systems can be\nused, and the results could be obtained for the original quasi-periodic system\nvia the L-P transformation. This approach is similar to using the\nLyapunov-Floquet (L-F) transformation to convert a linear time-periodic system\ninto an LTI system and perform analysis and control.\n  Order reduction is a systematic way of constructing dynamical system models\nwith relatively smaller states that accurately retain large-scale systems'\nessential dynamics.

Though the CW\ndecomposition of a Morse flow on a closed manifold is finite, the intersection\nof the unstable manifold and the stable manifold of saddles of a Morse-Smale\nflow on a closed manifold need not consist of finitely many connected\ncomponents (or equivalently need not consist of finitely many abstract weak\norbits). Therefore we study the finiteness of abstract weak orbit spaces of\nMorse(-Smale) flow on compact manifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2020 09:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

Considerable research work on AI\nexplainability attempts to win back trust in AI systems by developing\nexplanation methods but there is still no major breakthrough. At the same time,\npopular explanation methods (e.g., LIME, and SHAP) produce explanations that\nare very hard to understand for non-data scientist persona. To address this, we\npresent JOEL, a neural network-based framework to jointly learn a\ndecision-making task and associated explanations that convey domain knowledge.\nJOEL is tailored to human-in-the-loop domain experts that lack deep technical\nML knowledge, providing high-level insights about the model's predictions that\nvery much resemble the experts' own reasoning.

This paper proposes a method to tackle the one-to-many mapping\nproblem when performing automated lip reading using solely visual cues in two\nseparate scenarios: the first scenario is where the word boundary, that is, the\nbeginning and the ending of a word, is unknown; and the second scenario is\nwhere the boundary is known.\n  Sentences from the benchmark BBC dataset \"Lip Reading Sentences in the\nWild\"(LRS2), are classified with a character error rate of 10.7% and a word\nerror rate of 18.0%.
