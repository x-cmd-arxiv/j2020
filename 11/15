Because of their compositional nature, DL architectures\nnaturally exhibit several intermediate representations of the inputs, which\nbelong to so-called latent spaces.

Watermarking the signal at the\ntime of signal creation is a potential solution, but current techniques are\nbrittle and watermark detection mechanisms can easily be bypassed by applying\npost-processing transformations (cropping images, shifting pitch in the audio\netc.).

In this paper, we describe a\nrecurrent neural network architecture designed specifically to encode ionic\nmodels.

As the single-link communication rate decays exponentially with the\ndistance, to enable reliable end-to-end quantum communication, the number of\nnodes needs to grow with the network scale. For highly connected networks, we\nidentify a threshold transition in the capacity as the density of network nodes\nincreases---below a critical density, the rate is almost zero, while above the\nthreshold the rate increases linearly with the density. Surprisingly, above the\nthreshold the typical communication capacity between two nodes is independent\nof the distance between them, due to multi-path routing enabled by the quantum\nnetwork. In contrast, for less connected networks such as scale-free networks,\nthe end-to-end capacity saturates to constants as the number of nodes\nincreases, and always decays with the distance. Our results are based on\ncapacity evaluations, therefore the minimum density requirement for an\nappreciable capacity applies to any general protocols of quantum networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 21:42:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 23:18:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 15:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

In particular, hardware/software (hybrid) co-designs offer low\nhardware cost, while retaining similar security guarantees as (more expensive)\nhardware-based techniques. Hybrid trust anchors support security services, such\nas remote attestation, proofs of software update/erasure/reset, proofs of\nremote software execution, in resource-constrained MCU-s, e.g., MSP430 and AVR\nAtMega32. Despite these advances, detection of control-flow attacks in low-end\nMCU-s remains a challenge, since hardware requirements of the cheapest related\narchitectures are often more expensive than the MCU-s themselves. In this work,\nwe tackle this challenge by designing Tiny-CFA - a control-flow attestation\n(CFA) technique with a single hardware requirement - the ability to generate\nproofs of remote software execution (PoX). In turn, PoX can be implemented very\nefficiently and securely in low-end MCU-s. Consequently, our design achieves\nthe lowest hardware overhead of any CFA architecture (i.e., two orders of\nmagnitude cheaper), while relying on a formally verified PoX architecture as\nits sole hardware requirement. With respect to runtime overhead, Tiny-CFA also\nachieves better performance than prior CFA techniques based on code\ninstrumentation.

We establish that the average queue backlog under RL-QN\nwith an appropriately constructed subset can be arbitrarily close to the\noptimal result.

Inspired by the CGC filter\ndeveloped by Gupta and Vaidya, PODC 2020, we propose a gradient descent-based\nalgorithm, Echo-CGC. Our main novelty is a mechanism to utilize the broadcast\nproperties of the radio network to avoid transmitting the raw gradients (full\n$d$-dimensional vectors). In the radio network, each worker is able to overhear\nprevious gradients that were transmitted to the parameter server. Roughly\nspeaking, in Echo-CGC, if a worker \"agrees\" with a combination of prior\ngradients, it will broadcast the \"echo message\" instead of the its raw local\ngradient. The echo message contains a vector of coefficients (of size at most\n$n$) and the ratio of the magnitude between two gradients (a float). In\ncomparison, the traditional approaches need to send $n$ local gradients in each\nround, where each gradient is typically a vector in an ultra-high dimensional\nspace ($d\\gg n$). The improvement on communication complexity of our algorithm\ndepends on multiple factors, including number of nodes, number of faulty\nworkers in an execution, and the cost function. We numerically analyze the\nimprovement, and show that with a large number of nodes, Echo-CGC reduces\n$80\\%$ of the communication under standard assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 04:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

A major limitation has\nbeen the lack of tools to identify instantaneous spatial organization, while\nunravelling the superposition of structures. To address this, we present a\ngeneralized correlation framework, using: (i) correlation measures to identify\ninstantaneous vector-field patterns, and (ii) a Helmholtz-decomposition based\nstructure-disentanglement paradigm. After examples using canonical flows, we\napply these methods to homogeneous isotropic turbulence fields. We show that\nhigh kinetic energy ($E_k$) regions manifest as interspersed, localized,\nvelocity-jets, contrary to the prevalent view of high $E_k$ regions as large\nswirling structures (eddies). High enstrophy ($\\omega^2$) regions form small\nvorticity-jets, invariably surrounded by swirling-velocity. The jet-like and\nswirling-velocity structures are spatially exclusive. Decomposing the\nBiot-Savart contributions from different levels and regions of the\nvorticity-field reveals the organization of velocity-field structures. High\n$E_k$ jets are neither self-induced (due to their low vorticity contents), nor\ninduced by strong vorticity, being almost entirely induced, non-locally, by the\npermeating intermediate range (rms level) vorticity. High $\\omega^2$ swirls,\ninstead, are a superposition of self-induced swirling-velocity along with a\nbackground-induced flow. Moreover, intermediate vorticity dominantly induces\nthe velocity-field everywhere. This suggests that turbulence organization could\nemerge from non-local and non-linear field interactions, dominated by\npermeating intermediate vorticity, leading to an alternative description of\nturbulence, contrary to the notion of a strict structural hierarchy.

It is shown that positive and negative streamers\nbehave in radically different ways when decelerating and stopping. When the\nhead potential drops, the negative streamer transits to the mode in which the\npropagation is due to the forward electron drift. In this case, the radius of\nthe ionization wave front increases, whereas the electric field at the streamer\nhead decreases further and the streamer stops. The only advancement mechanism\nfor a positive streamer with decreasing head potential is a decrease in the\neffective radius of the ionization wave, leading to a local increase in the\nelectric field. This mechanism compensates for the decrease in the efficiency\nof gas photoionization at small head diameters. The local electric field at the\nstreamer head can exceed the runaway threshold when the head potential\ndecreases to ~1.2 kV in atmospheric pressure air. In this case, pulsed\ngeneration of a beam of runaway electrons directed into the channel of a\nstopping positive streamer can occur.

Existing conditional\nGANs (cGANs) are mainly designed for categorical conditions (eg, class labels);\nconditioning on regression labels is mathematically distinct and raises two\nfundamental problems:(P1) Since there may be very few (even zero) real images\nfor some regression labels, minimizing existing empirical versions of cGAN\nlosses (aka empirical cGAN losses) often fails in practice;(P2) Since\nregression labels are scalar and infinitely many, conventional label input\nmethods are not applicable. The proposed CcGAN solves the above problems,\nrespectively, by (S1) reformulating existing empirical cGAN losses to be\nappropriate for the continuous scenario; and (S2) proposing a naive label input\n(NLI) method and an improved label input (ILI) method to incorporate regression\nlabels into the generator and the discriminator. The reformulation in (S1)\nleads to two novel empirical discriminator losses, termed the hard vicinal\ndiscriminator loss (HVDL) and the soft vicinal discriminator loss (SVDL)\nrespectively, and a novel empirical generator loss. The error bounds of a\ndiscriminator trained with HVDL and SVDL are derived under mild assumptions in\nthis work.

(PODS 2020, best paper award) show\nhow to convert a non-robust algorithm into a robust one with a roughly\n$1/\\varepsilon$ factor overhead. This was subsequently improved to a\n$1/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}$ factor overhead by Hassidim et. al. (NeurIPS 2020, oral\npresentation), suppressing logarithmic factors.

We show how to bypass this impossibility result by developing data\nstream algorithms for a large class of streaming problems, with no overhead in\nthe approximation factor. Our class of streaming problems includes the most\nwell-studied problems such as the $L_2$-heavy hitters problem, $F_p$-moment\nestimation, as well as empirical entropy estimation. We substantially improve\nupon all prior work on these problems, giving the first optimal dependence on\nthe approximation factor.\n  As in previous work, we obtain a general transformation that applies to any\nnon-robust streaming algorithm and depends on the so-called twist number.\nHowever, the key technical innovation is that we apply the transformation to\nwhat we call a difference estimator for the streaming problem, rather than an\nestimator for the streaming problem itself. We then develop the first\ndifference estimators for a wide range of problems. Our difference estimator\nmethodology is not only applicable to the adversarially robust model, but to\nother streaming models where temporal properties of the data play a central\nrole.

In this paper we propose a Fair\nAdversarial Instance Re-weighting (FAIR) method, which uses adversarial\ntraining to learn instance weighting function that ensures fair predictions.\nMerging the two paradigms, it inherits desirable properties from both --\ninterpretability of reweighting and end-to-end trainability of adversarial\ntraining. We propose four different variants of the method and, among other\nthings, demonstrate how the method can be cast in a fully probabilistic\nframework. Additionally, theoretical analysis of FAIR models' properties have\nbeen studied extensively. We compare FAIR models to 7 other related and\nstate-of-the-art models and demonstrate that FAIR is able to achieve a better\ntrade-off between accuracy and unfairness. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first model that merges reweighting and adversarial approaches by means\nof a weighting function that can provide interpretable information about\nfairness of individual instances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 10:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

These schemes essentially\nselect a pre-specified number of sites so as to maximise their aggregate power\noutput and their spatiotemporal complementarity, respectively. In addition, two\nvariants of these siting schemes are provided, wherein the number of sites to\nbe selected is specified on a country-by-country basis rather than Europe-wide.\nIn the second stage, the subset of previously identified sites is passed to a\ncapacity expansion planning (CEP) framework that sizes the power generation,\ntransmission and storage assets that should be deployed and operated in order\nto satisfy pre-specified electricity demand levels at minimum cost. Results\nshow that the complementarity-based siting criterion leads to system designs\nwhich are up to 5% cheaper than the ones relying the power output-based\ncriterion when offshore wind plants are deployed with no consideration for\ncountry-based deployment targets. On the contrary, the power output-based\nscheme leads to system designs which are consistently 2% cheaper than the ones\nleveraging the complementarity-based siting strategy when such constraints are\nenforced. The robustness of the results is supported by a sensitivity analysis\non offshore wind capital expenditure and inter-annual weather variability,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 12:43:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 08:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

In some\ntransportation tasks, two drones are required to lift the load together, which\nbrings even more significant challenges to the control problem because the\ntransportation system is underactuated and it contains very complex dynamic\ncoupling. When transporting bar-shaped objects, the load's attitude, the rope's\nswing motion, as well as the distance between the drones, should be carefully\nconsidered to ensure the security of the system. So far, few works have been\nimplemented for double drone transportation systems to guarantee their\ntransportation performance, especially in the aforementioned aspect. In this\npaper, a nonlinear cooperative control method is proposed, with both rigorous\nstability analysis and experimental results demonstrating its great\nperformance. Without the need to distinguish the identities between the leader\nand the follower, the proposed method successfully realizes effective control\nfor the two drones separately, mainly owning to the deep analysis for the\nsystem dynamics and the elaborate design for the control law. By utilizing\nLyapunov techniques, the proposed controller achieves simultaneous positioning\nand mutual distance control of the drones, meanwhile, it efficiently eliminates\nthe swing of the load. Flight experiments are presented to demonstrate the\nperformance of the proposed nonlinear cooperative control strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 12:49:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

Towards this, we present a data augmentation method for\ngenerating synthetic medical images using cycle-consistency Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs). We add semi-supervised attention modules to\ngenerate images with convincing details. We treat tumor images and normal\nimages as two domains. The proposed GANs-based model can generate a tumor image\nfrom a normal image, and in turn, it can also generate a normal image from a\ntumor image. Furthermore, we show that generated medical images can be used for\nimproving the performance of ResNet18 for medical image classification. Our\nmodel is applied to three limited datasets of tumor MRI images. We first\ngenerate MRI images on limited datasets, then we trained three popular\nclassification models to get the best model for tumor classification.

Recently, a group of works have used\ndecision-tree-based models to learn explainable policies. Soft decision trees\n(SDTs) and discretized differentiable decision trees (DDTs) have been\ndemonstrated to achieve both good performance and share the benefit of having\nexplainable policies. In this work, we further improve the results for\ntree-based explainable RL in both performance and explainability. Our proposal,\nCascading Decision Trees (CDTs) apply representation learning on the decision\npath to allow richer expressivity. Empirical results show that in both\nsituations, where CDTs are used as policy function approximators or as\nimitation learners to explain black-box policies, CDTs can achieve better\nperformances with more succinct and explainable models than SDTs. As a second\ncontribution our study reveals limitations of explaining black-box policies via\nimitation learning with tree-based explainable models, due to its inherent\ninstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 15:25:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 10:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

In addition to that we focus on\nthe problem of distinguishing networks created by cloning from those which are\ncreated by distributing independently generated entangled pairs. We find that\nthere are several states which cannot be distinguished using the Finner\ninequalities in the standard way. For such states, we propose an extension to\nthe existing Finner inequality for triangle networks by further increasing the\nnumber of observers from three to four or six depending on the network\ntopology. This takes into account the additional correlations that exist in the\ncase of cloned networks.

Speech\nsamples are collected from de-identified telemedicine phonecalls from a\nhealthcare provider in Bangladesh. The recordings include conversational speech\nsamples of patients talking to doctors showing mild or severe respiratory\ndistress or asthma symptoms. We hypothesize that respiratory distress may alter\nspeech features such as voice quality, speaking pattern, loudness, and\nspeech-pause duration. To capture these variations, we utilize a set of\nwell-known acoustic and prosodic features with a Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nclassifier for detecting the presence of respiratory distress. Experimental\nevaluations are performed using a 3-fold cross-validation scheme, ensuring\npatient-independent data splits. We obtained an overall accuracy of 86.4\\% in\ndetecting respiratory distress from the speech recordings using the acoustic\nfeature set. Correlation analysis reveals that the top-performing features\ninclude loudness, voice rate, voice duration, and pause duration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 13:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-19"}

In order to be the\nVSL as a viable theory, it should inherit the success of special relativity\nincluding Maxwell equations and thermodynamics at least. Thus, we adopt that\nthe speed of light, $\\tilde c$ varies for the cosmic time not for the local\ntime, i.e., $\\tilde c[z]$ where $z$ is the cosmological redshift. When one\ndescribes the background FLRW universe, one can define the constant-time\nhypersurface by using physical quantities such as temperature, density, and\n$\\tilde c$. It is because they evolve in time, and the homogeneity of the\nUniverse demands that they must equal at the equal cosmic time. The variation\nof $\\tilde c$ accompanies the joint variations of all related physical\nconstants in order to satisfy the Lorentz invariance, thermodynamics, and\nBianchi identity. We call this VSL model as a \"minimally extended VSL (meVSL)\".\nWe derive cosmological observables of meVSL and obtain the constraints on the\nvariation of $\\tilde c$ by using the current observations. Interestingly, $z$\nand all geometrical distances except the luminosity distance of meVSL are the\nsame as those of general relativity. However, the Hubble parameter of meVSL is\nrescaled as $H = (1+z)^{-b/4} H^{(\\rm GR)}$ which might be used as a solution\nfor the tension of the Hubble parameter measurements. In this manuscript, we\nprovide the main effects of meVSL on various cosmological observations\nincluding BBN, CMB, SZE, BAO, SNe, GWs, H, SL, and $\\Delta \\alpha$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 11:42:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 23:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-27"}

However,\nU-Net is mainly engaged in segmentation, and the extracted features are also\ntargeted at segmentation location information, and the input and output are\ndifferent. The label we need is that the input and output are both original\nmasks, which is more similar to the refactoring process, so we propose another\nintermediate supervision mechanism. However, the features extracted by the\ncontraction path of this intermediate monitoring mechanism are not necessarily\nconsistent.
