Examples of spectral sums are the von Neumann entropy, the trace\nof inverse, the log-determinant, and the Schatten-$p$ norm, where the latter\ndoes not require the matrix to be SPD. The fastest classical randomized\nalgorithms estimate these quantities have a runtime that depends at least\nlinearly on the number of nonzero components of the matrix. Assuming quantum\naccess to the matrix, our algorithms are sub-linear in the matrix size, and\ndepend at most quadratically on other quantities, like the condition number and\nthe approximation error, and thus can compete with most of the randomized and\ndistributed classical algorithms proposed in recent literature. These\nalgorithms can be used as subroutines for solving many practical problems, for\nwhich the estimation of a spectral sum often represents a computational\nbottleneck.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 16:29:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

By making use of colour-colour diagrams,\nearly-type galaxies (ETGs) can be classified in terms of their UV emission in\nmainly three categories: residual star-formation, UV weak, and UV upturn. This\nthesis aims at investigating galaxies presenting UV upturn by comparing them to\nUV weak systems. This investigation has three fronts: (i) the assessment of the\nevolution in redshift (z) and stellar mass (logM*) of the fraction of UV upturn\nsystems in terms of the total of UV bright ETGs; (ii) the stratification of the\nfirst study in terms of emission lines; (iii) the comparison between UV weak\nand upturn for passive RSGs in terms of their stellar populations. To tackle\nthe first front, a Bayesian logistic model was applied. The second front\nexpands on the first, dividing the sample into emission line classes. The final\nfront is focused on the study of stellar population properties of UV weak and\nupturn systems, by making use of catalogues from GAMA-DR3. The results show\nthat the fraction of UV upturn systems rises up to z~0.25, followed by a\ndecline which remains to be confirmed. By stratifying the sample into emission\nline classes, the galaxies classified as retired/passive -- the ones associated\nwith evolved stellar phases -- dominate the behaviour with z and logM*. By\nanalysing the stellar populations of both types of systems, different\ncharacteristics emerge such as median ages, metallicities, and time since last\nburst of star formation. These results seem to indicate that UV upturn systems\nhave narrower star-formation histories, higher metallicities, and slightly\nolder populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 16:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-19"}

In this paper, we investigate resource\nallocation for IRS-assisted green multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO)\nsystems. To minimize the total transmit power, both the beamforming vectors at\nthe access point (AP) and the phase shifts at multiple IRSs are jointly\noptimized, while taking into account the minimum required quality-of-service\n(QoS) of multiple users. First, two novel algorithms, namely a penalty-based\nalternating minimization (AltMin) algorithm and an inner approximation (IA)\nalgorithm, are developed to tackle the non-convexity of the formulated\noptimization problem when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available.\nUnlike existing designs that cannot ensure convergence, the proposed\npenalty-based AltMin and IA algorithms are guaranteed to converge to a\nstationary point and a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution of the design problem,\nrespectively. Second, the impact of imperfect knowledge of the CSI of the\nchannels between the AP and the users is investigated. To this end, a\nnon-convex robust optimization problem is formulated and the penalty-based\nAltMin algorithm is extended to obtain a stationary solution. Simulation\nresults reveal a key trade-off between the speed of convergence and the\nachievable total transmit power for the two proposed algorithms. In addition,\nwe show that the proposed algorithms can significantly reduce the total\ntransmit power at the AP compared to various baseline schemes and that the\noptimal numbers of transmit antennas and IRS reflecting elements, which\nminimize the total power consumption of the considered system, are finite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 16:35:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

The spectral analysis is further extended in frequency to the UV and\nX-ray bands with data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. We develop a new\nmethod to unveil the shortest optical variability time-scales. This is based on\nprogressive de-trending of the TESS light curve by means of cubic spline\ninterpolations through the binned fluxes, with decreasing time bins. The\nde-trended light curves are then analysed with classical tools for time-series\nanalysis (periodogram, auto-correlation and structure functions). The results\nshow that below 3 d there are significant characteristic variability\ntime-scales of about 1.7, 0.5, and 0.2 d. Variability on time-scales < 0.2 d is\nstrongly chromatic and must be ascribed to intrinsic energetic processes\ninvolving emitting regions, likely jet sub-structures, with dimension less than\nabout milliparsec. In contrast, flux changes on time-scales > 0.5 d are\nquasi-achromatic and are probably due to Doppler factor changes of geometric\norigin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 17:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

One of the\nmost efficient strategies to mitigate the communication bottleneck is top-K\nsparsification.

To address these issues, we introduce a novel majority voting based\nsparse communication strategy, in which the workers first seek a consensus on\nthe structure of the sparse representation. This strategy provides a\nsignificant reduction in the communication load and allows using the same\nsparsity level in both communication directions.

Many industrial applications rely\non task-specific gripper designs to ensure the system's robustness and\naccuracy. However, the process of manual hardware design is both costly and\ntime-consuming, and the quality of the resulting design is dependent on the\nengineer's experience and domain expertise, which can easily be out-dated or\ninaccurate. The goal of this work is to use machine learning algorithms to\nautomate the design of task-specific gripper fingers. We propose Fit2Form, a 3D\ngenerative design framework that generates pairs of finger shapes to maximize\ndesign objectives (i.e., grasp success, stability, and robustness) for target\ngrasp objects. We model the design objectives by training a Fitness network to\npredict their values for pairs of gripper fingers and their corresponding grasp\nobjects. This Fitness network then provides supervision to a 3D Generative\nnetwork that produces a pair of 3D finger geometries for the target grasp\nobject. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed 3D generative design\nframework generates parallel jaw gripper finger shapes that achieve more stable\nand robust grasps compared to other general-purpose and task-specific gripper\ndesign algorithms.

Among them, a\nrecent ATLAS result on $t\\bar t H$ production has also reported an excess in\nthe charge asymmetry in the same-sign dilepton channel with two or more\n$b$-tagged jets. Motivated by these tantalizing discrepancies, we study a\nphenomenological New Physics model consisting of a $Z'$ boson that couples to\nup-type quarks via right-handed currents: $t_R\\gamma^\\mu \\bar t_R$,\n$t_R\\gamma^\\mu \\bar c_R$, and $t_R \\gamma^\\mu \\bar u_R$. The latter vertex\nallows to translate the charge asymmetry at the LHC initial state protons to a\nfinal state with top quarks which, decaying to a positive lepton and a $b$-jet,\nprovides a crucial contribution to some of the observed discrepancies. Through\nan analysis at a detector level, we select the region in parameter space of our\nmodel that best reproduces the data in the aforementioned $t\\bar t H$ study,\nand in a recent ATLAS $t\\bar t t \\bar t$ search. We find that our model\nprovides a better fit to the experimental data than the Standard Model for a\nNew Physics scale of approximately $\\sim$500 GeV, and with a hierarchical\ncoupling of the $Z'$ boson that favours the top quark and the presence of FCNC\ncurrents. In order to estimate the LHC sensitivity to this signal, we design a\nbroadband search featuring many kinematic regions with different\nsignal-to-background ratio, and perform a global analysis. We also define\nsignal-enhanced regions and study observables that could further distinguish\nsignal from background.

These\npowerful notions have recently been extended to hypergraphs, which are much\nricher and may offer new applications. However, the current bounds on the size\nof hypergraph sparsifiers are not as tight as the corresponding bounds for\ngraphs.\n  Our first result is a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a hypergraph on\n$n$ vertices with maximum hyperedge size $r$, outputs an $\\epsilon$-spectral\nsparsifier with $O^*(nr)$ hyperedges, where $O^*$ suppresses $(\\epsilon^{-1}\n\\log n)^{O(1)}$ factors.

Even for this special case, the best current algorithm\nachieves a $\\tilde O(\\sqrt n)$-approximation, while the best current negative\nresult is APX-hardness. All current approximation algorithms for the problem\nbuild on the same paradigm: compute a set $E'$ of edges (called a\n\\emph{planarizing set}) such that $G\\setminus E'$ is planar; compute a planar\ndrawing of $G\\setminus E'$; then add the drawings of the edges of $E'$ to the\nresulting drawing.

We argue that\nthese conditions can be satisfied by $n$-bit block ciphers implemented via\nrandom reversible circuits with ${\\cal O}(n \\log n)$ gates arranged on a tree\nstructure, with layers of $n/3$ 3-bit gates, for which a \"key\" specifies\nuniquely the sequence of gates that comprise the circuit. We show that in order\nto reach this \"speed limit\" one must employ a three-stage circuit consisting of\na stage implemented by layers of nonlinear gates that proliferate the number of\nstrings, flanked by two other stages, each deploying layers of a special set of\nlinear \"inflationary\" gates that accelerate the growth of small individual\nstrings. A shallow, ${\\cal O}(\\log n)$-depth cipher of the type described here\ncan be used in constructing a polynomial-overhead scheme for computation on\nencrypted data proposed in another publication as an alternative to Homomorphic\nEncryption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 18:06:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 15:36:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 6 Mar 2022 16:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

We consider different setups, where: (1)\nthe magnetic insulator induces an exchange field in the superconductor, which\nleads to a splitting in the semiconductor by proximity effect, and (2) the\nmagnetic insulator acts as a spin-filter tunnel barrier between the\nsuperconductor and the semiconductor. We show that the spin splitting in the\nsuperconductor alone cannot induce a topological transition in the\nsemiconductor. To overcome this limitation, we propose to use a spin-filter\nbarrier that enhances the magnetic exchange and provides a mechanism for a\ntopological phase transition. Moreover, the spin-dependent tunneling introduces\na strong dependence on the band alignment, which can be crucial in\nquantum-confined systems.

Suppose there exists a separating hyperplane\n(identified with its unit normal vector $w)$ for the points, i.e a hyperplane\nsuch that points of same color lie on the same side of the hyperplane. We\nmeasure the quality of such a hyperplane by its margin $\\gamma(w)$, defined as\nminimum distance between any of the points $x_i$ and the hyperplane. In this\npaper, we prove that the margin function $\\gamma$ satisfies a nonsmooth\nKurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality with exponent $1/2$. This result has\nfar-reaching consequences. For example, let $\\gamma^{opt}$ be the maximum\npossible margin for the problem and let $w^{opt}$ be the parameter for the\nhyperplane which attains this value. Given any other separating hyperplane with\nparameter $w$, let $d(w):=\\|w-w^{opt}\\|$ be the euclidean distance between $w$\nand $w^{opt}$, also called the bias of $w$. From the previous KL-inequality, we\ndeduce that $(\\gamma^{opt}-\\gamma(w)) / R \\le d(w) \\le\n2\\sqrt{(\\gamma^{opt}-\\gamma(w))/\\gamma^{opt}}$, where $R:=\\max_i \\|x_i\\|$ is\nthe maximum distance of the points $x_i$ from the origin. Consequently, for any\noptimization algorithm (gradient-descent or not), the bias of the iterates\nconverges at least as fast as the square-root of the rate of their convergence\nof the margin. Thus, our work provides a generic tool for analyzing the\nimplicit bias of any algorithm in terms of its margin, in situations where a\nspecialized analysis might not be available: it is sufficient to establish a\ngood rate for converge of the margin, a task which is usually much easier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 18:09:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 10:52:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 18:59:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 17:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

This measurement can be confounded by modelling uncertainties\nrelated to so-called \"baryonic effects\" on the clustering of matter, arising\nfrom gas dynamics, star formation, and feedback from active galactic nuclei and\nsupernovae. In particular, a wrong assumption about the form of baryonic\neffects on CMB lensing can bias a neutrino mass measurement by a significant\nfraction of the statistical uncertainty. In this paper, we investigate three\nmethods for mitigating this bias: (1) restricting the use of small-scale CMB\nlensing information when constraining neutrino mass; (2) using an external\ntracer to remove the low-redshift contribution to a CMB lensing map; and (3)\nmarginalizing over a parametric model for baryonic effects on large-scale\nstructure.

The\ntemperature of the Comptonizing plasma that forms the corona is manifested\nthrough a high-energy cutoff that has been difficult to directly constrain even\nin the brightest AGN because it requires high-quality data at energies above 10\nkeV. In this paper we present a large collection of coronal cutoff constraints\nfor obscured AGN based on a sample of 130 AGN selected in the hard X-ray band\nwith Swift/BAT and observed nearly simultaneously with NuSTAR and Swift/XRT. We\nfind that under a reasonable set of assumptions regarding partial constraints\nthe median cutoff is well constrained to 290$\\pm$20 keV, where the uncertainty\nis statistical and given at the 68% confidence level. We investigate the\nsensitivity of this result to our assumptions and find that consideration of\nvarious known systematic uncertainties robustly places the median cutoff\nbetween 240 keV and 340 keV. The central 68% of the intrinsic cutoff\ndistribution is found to be between about 140 keV and 500 keV, with estimated\nuncertainties of 20 keV and 100 keV, respectively. In comparison with the\nliterature, we find no clear evidence that the cutoffs in obscured and\nunobscured AGN are substantially different. Our analysis highlights the\nimportance of carefully considering partial and potentially degenerate\nconstraints on the coronal high-energy cutoff in AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 18:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

A prototypical model is a\ntheory of dark baryons of a non-Abelian gauge group, i.e., a dark Quantum\nChromo-Dynamics (QCD). For sub-eV dark baryon masses, the inner region of dark\nmatter halos is naturally at 'nuclear density', allowing for the formation of\nexotic states of matter, akin to neutron stars.

Comparing them to photometric based spectral slopes in the range\n1250-1750 Angstrom, we find that the stellar metallicity increases by ~0.5 dex\nfrom beta ~ -2 to beta ~ -1 (1 < A(1600) < 3.2), and a dependence with beta\nholds at fixed UV absolute luminosity M(UV) and stellar mass up to 10^(9.65)\nMsun. As a result, the metallicity is a fundamental ingredient for properly\nrescaling dust corrections based on M(UV) and M*. Using the same absorption\nfeatures, we analyze the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and find it is\nconsistent with the previous VANDELS estimation based on a global fit of the\nFUV spectra. Similarly, we do not find a significant evolution between z=2 and\nz=3.5. Finally, the slopes of our MZR and Z*-beta relation are in agreement\nwith the predictions of well-studied semi-analytic models of galaxy formation\n(SAM), while some tensions with observations remain as to the absolute\nmetallicity normalization. The relation between UV slope and stellar\nmetallicity is fundamental for the exploitation of large volume surveys with\nnext-generation telescopes and for the physical characterization of galaxies in\nthe first billion years of our Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 19:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

We develop a\nformalism in which the differential equation describing the field line random\nwalk contains both effects due to localized magnetic displacements and a\nnon-stochastic contribution from the large-scale expansion. We use this\nformalism together with a global magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the\ninner-heliospheric solar wind, which includes a turbulence transport model, to\nestimate the diffusive spreading of magnetic field lines that originate in\ndifferent regions of the solar atmosphere.

For\nthis purpose, a new gyrofluid model is derived and subsequently simplified to\nmake the derivation of the dispersion relation treatable analytically. The main\nsimplifying assumptions consist in assuming cold ions, neglecting electron\nfinite Larmor radius effects, decoupling ion gyrocenter fluctuations and\nconsidering $\\beta_{\\perp_e} \\ll 1$, with $\\beta_{\\perp_e}$ indicating the\nratio between the perpendicular electron thermal pressure and the magnetic\npressure exerted by the guide field.

This observation supports an interestingly reversed mindset against\nconventional wisdom: While the existence of unique steady states was often\npresumed in continual learning but considered less relevant in episodic\nlearning, it turns out their existence is guaranteed for the latter. Based on\nthis insight, the paper unifies episodic and continual RL around several\nimportant concepts that have been separately treated in these two RL\nformalisms. Practically, the existence of unique and approachable steady state\nenables a general way to collect data in episodic RL tasks, which the paper\napplies to policy gradient algorithms as a demonstration, based on a new\nsteady-state policy gradient theorem. Finally, the paper also proposes and\nexperimentally validates a perturbation method that facilitates rapid\nsteady-state convergence in real-world RL tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 19:34:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 17:40:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

Hard X-ray (HXR)\nflare emission originates from both hot (millions of Kelvin) plasma and\nnonthermal accelerated particles, giving insight into flare energy release. The\nNuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR) utilizes direct focusing optics\nto attain much higher sensitivity in the HXR range than that of previous\nindirect imagers. This paper presents eleven NuSTAR microflares from two active\nregions (AR 12671 on 2017 August 21, and AR 12712 on 2018 May 29). The\ntemporal, spatial, and energetic properties of each are discussed in context\nwith previously published HXR brightenings. They are seen to display several\n'large-flare' properties, such as impulsive time profiles and earlier peaktimes\nin higher energy HXRs. For two events where active region background could be\nremoved, microflare emission did not display spatial complexity: differing\nNuSTAR energy ranges had equivalent emission centroids. Finally, spectral\nfitting showed a high energy excess over a single thermal model in all events.\nThis excess was consistent with additional higher-temperature plasma volumes in\n10/11 microflares, and consistent only with an accelerated particle\ndistribution in the last. Previous NuSTAR studies focused on one or a few\nmicroflares at a time, making this the first to collectively examine a sizable\nnumber of events. Additionally, this paper introduces an observed variation in\nthe NuSTAR gain unique to the extremely low-livetime (<1%) regime, and\nestablishes a correction method to be used in future NuSTAR solar spectral\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 21:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

Such a\nmodeling framework is important to a wide variety of problems ranging from\nLi-ion batteries, moisture diffusion in cementitious materials, hydrogen\ndiffusion in metals, to consolidation of soils under severe loading-unloading\nregimes. The mathematical model incorporates experimental observations reported\nin the literature on how (elastic and plastic) material properties change\nbecause of the presence and transport of a chemical species. Also, the model\naccounts for one-way (transport affects the deformation but not vice versa) and\ntwo-way couplings between deformation and transport subproblems. The resulting\ncoupled equations are not amenable to analytical solutions; so, we present a\nrobust computational framework for obtaining numerical solutions. Given that\npopular numerical formulations do not produce nonnegative solutions, the\ncomputational framework uses an optimized-based nonnegative formulation that\nrespects physical constraints (e.g., nonnegative concentrations). For\ncompleteness, we will also show the effect and propagation of the negative\nconcentrations, often produced by contemporary transport solvers, into the\noverall predictions of deformation and concentration fields. Notably,\nanisotropy of the diffusion process exacerbates these unphysical violations.\nUsing representative numerical examples, we will discuss how the concentration\nfield affects plastic deformations of a degrading solid. Based on these\nnumerical examples, we also discuss how plastic zones spread because of\nmaterial degradation.

Inexpensive auxiliary covariates predictive of\nthe outcome may often be available in patients' health records, presenting an\nopportunity to recruit patients selectively and estimate the mean outcome\nefficiently. In this paper, we propose a two-phase sampling design that\nleverages available information on auxiliary covariates in EHR data. A key\nchallenge in using EHR data for multi-phase sampling is the potential selection\nbias, because EHR data are not necessarily representative of the target\npopulation. Extending existing literature on two-phase sampling designs, we\nderive an optimal two-phase sampling method that improves efficiency over\nrandom sampling while accounting for the potential selection bias in EHR data.\nWe demonstrate the efficiency gain of our sampling design by conducting finite\nsample simulation studies and an application study based on data from the\nMichigan Genomics Initiative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 21:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-16"}

Traditional predictions use statistical information on recurrence\nintervals, but those predictions are not accurate enough. In a recent paper, a\nmachine learning approach was proposed and applied to data of laboratory\nearthquakes. The machine learning algorithm utilizes continuous measurements of\nradiated energy through acoustic emissions and the authors were able to\nsuccessfully predict the timing of laboratory earthquakes. Here, we reproduced\ntheir model which was applied to a gouge layer of glass beads and applied it to\na data set obtained using a gouge layer of salt. In this salt experiment\ndifferent load point velocities were set, leading to variable recurrence times.\nThe machine learning technique we use is called random forest and uses the\nacoustic emissions during the interseismic period. The random forest model\nsucceeds in making a relatively reliable prediction for both materials, also\nlong before the earthquake. Apparently there is information in the data on the\ntiming of the next earthquake throughout the experiment. For glass beads energy\nis gradually and increasingly released whereas for salt energy is only released\nduring precursor activity, therefore the important features used in the\nprediction are different. We interpret the difference in results to be due to\nthe different micromechanics of slip. The research shows that a machine\nlearning approach can reveal the presence of information in the data on the\ntiming of unstable slip events (earthquakes).

Through numerical results, we have discussed\nhow utilizing the cognitive RF--FSO fronthaul assignment achieves higher energy\nefficiency compared to that of FSO-only, RF-only, or simultaneously using RF\nand FSO fronthaul links, e.g., achieving up to $198\\%$ higher energy efficiency\nunder unfavorable conditions. Moreover, the effects of FSO misalignment,\nweather conditions, and power allocations on the performances of the CF- and\nUC-mMIMO networks are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 22:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 10:50:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 10:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

I focus on a practically relevant situation in which\nadditional covariates are required for identification while the reduced-form\nand first-stage regressions implicitly restrict the effects of the instrument\nto be homogeneous, and are thus possibly misspecified. I show that the weights\non some conditional LATEs are negative and the IV estimand is no longer\ninterpretable as a causal effect under a weaker version of monotonicity, i.e.\nwhen there are compliers but no defiers at some covariate values and defiers\nbut no compliers elsewhere.

Typically, an external ignition\nsource in the form of a spark is used to achieve a stable flame in the\ncombustor. However, such forced turbulent ignition may not always successfully\nrelight the combustor, mainly because the state of the combustor cannot be\nprecisely determined. Uncertainty in the turbulent flow inside the combustor,\ninflow conditions, and spark discharge characteristics can lead to variability\nin sparking outcomes even for nominally identical operating conditions. Prior\nstudies have shown that of all the uncertain parameters, turbulence is often\ndominant and can drastically alter ignition behavior. For instance, even when\ndifferent fuels have similar ignition delay times, their ignition behavior in\npractical systems can be completely different. In practical operating\nconditions, it is challenging to understand why ignition fails and how much\nvariation in outcomes can be expected. The focus of this work is to understand\nrelight variability induced by turbulence for two different aircraft fuels,\nnamely Jet-A and a variant named C1. A detailed, previously developed\nsimulation approach is used to generate a large number of successful and failed\nignition events. Using this data, the cause of misfire is evaluated based on a\ndiscriminant analysis that delineates the difference between turbulent initial\nconditions that lead to ignition or failure. It was determined that the cause\nof ignition failure is different for the two fuels. While it was found that\nJet-A is influenced by fuel entrainment, C1 was found to be more sensitive to\nsmall scale turbulence features. A larger variability is found in the ignition\nmodes of C1, which can be subject to extreme events induced by kernel\nbreakdown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 00:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-16"}

Existing dependency-based methods adopt different\nimplementations and show different strengths and weaknesses. However, the\ntheoretical fundamentals and the general process behind them have not been well\nstudied. This paper proposes a general framework, DepAD, to provide a unified\nprocess for dependency-based anomaly detection. DepAD decomposes unsupervised\nanomaly detection tasks into feature selection and prediction problems.\nUtilizing off-the-shelf techniques, the DepAD framework can have various\ninstantiations to suit different application domains. Comprehensive experiments\nhave been conducted over one hundred instantiated DepAD methods with 32\nreal-world datasets to evaluate the performance of representative techniques in\nDepAD. To show the effectiveness of DepAD, we compare two DepAD methods with\nnine state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, and the results show that\nDepAD methods outperform comparison methods in most cases.

Recent years have witnessed the emergence of a new field,\nvalleytronics, which seeks to exploit electron's valley index rather than its\nspin. An important component in this quest would be the ability to control the\nvalley index in a convenient fashion. Here we show that the valley polarization\ncan be switched from zero to one by a small reduction in density, simply tuned\nby a gate bias, in a two-dimensional electron system. This phenomenon arises\nfundamentally as a result of electron-electron interaction in an itinerant,\ndilute electron system. Essentially, the kinetic energy favors an equal\ndistribution of electrons over the available valleys, whereas the interaction\nbetween electrons prefers single-valley occupancy below a critical density. The\ngate-bias-tuned transition we observe is accompanied by a sudden, two-fold\nchange in sample resistance, making the phenomenon of interest for potential\nvalleytronic transistor device applications.

Unfortunately, as reported in several studies\nthese algorithms inject bias from data and environment leading to inequitable\nand unfair solutions. To mitigate bias in machine learning, different\nformalizations of fairness have been proposed that can be categorized into\ngroup fairness and individual fairness. Group fairness requires that different\ngroups should be treated similarly which might be unfair to some individuals\nwithin a group. On the other hand, individual fairness requires that similar\nindividuals be treated similarly. However, individual fairness remains\nunderstudied due to its reliance on problem-specific similarity metrics.

One method to reduce the size of the DNN\nis to quantize the pre-trained model by using a low-bit expression for weights\nand activations, using fine-tuning to recover the drop in accuracy. However, it\nis generally difficult to train neural networks which use low-bit expressions.\nOne reason is that the weights in the middle layer of the DNN have a wide\ndynamic range and so when quantizing the wide dynamic range into a few bits,\nthe step size becomes large, which leads to a large quantization error and\nfinally a large degradation in accuracy. To solve this problem, this paper\nmakes the following three contributions without using any additional learning\nparameters and hyper-parameters. First, we analyze how batch normalization,\nwhich causes the aforementioned problem, disturbs the fine-tuning of the\nquantized DNN. Second, based on these results, we propose a new pruning method\ncalled Pruning for Quantization (PfQ) which removes the filters that disturb\nthe fine-tuning of the DNN while not affecting the inferred result as far as\npossible. Third, we propose a workflow of fine-tuning for quantized DNNs using\nthe proposed pruning method(PfQ).

A time-varying state\nrepresentation and reward function have been developed for proper convergence.\nThe formulation uses the sensor information about the observable environment\nand prior knowledge of the confinement boundary.

One\nknown limitation of the Harris and Wilson model is that it can have multiple\nlocally stable equilibria, leading to a dependence of predictions on the\ninitial state. To overcome this, we employ equilibrium refinement by stochastic\nstability. We build on the fact that the model is a large-population potential\ngame and that stochastically stable states in a potential game correspond to\nglobal potential maximizers. Unlike local stability under deterministic\ndynamics, the stochastic stability approach allows a unique and unambiguous\nprediction for urban spatial configurations.

It is the first online pipeline to select candidates\nfrom multiple detectors using a coherent statistic based on the maximum network\nlikelihood ratio statistic principle. Here we simplify the derivation of this\nstatistic using the singular-value-decomposition (SVD) technique and show that\nsingle-detector signal-to-noise ratios from matched filtering can be directly\nused to construct the statistic for each sky direction. Coherent searches are\nin general more computationally challenging than coincidence searches due to\nextra search over sky direction parameters. The search over sky directions\nfollows an embarrassing parallelization paradigm and has been accelerated using\nGPUs. The detection performance is reported using a segment of public data from\nLIGO-Virgo's second observation run. We demonstrate that the median latency of\nthe SPIIR pipeline is less than 9 seconds, and present an achievable roadmap to\nreduce the latency to less than 5 seconds. During the O3 online run, SPIIR\nregistered triggers associated with 38 of the 56 non-retracted public alerts.\nThe extreme low-latency nature makes it a competitive choice for joint\ntime-domain observations, and offers the tantalizing possibility of making\npublic alerts prior to the merger phase of binary coalescence systems involving\nat least one neutron star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 07:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 09:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

We have found ${\\tau}$-values, as well as the shape\nchange coefficients, of 294 fireballs with determined masses in the range of\n$10^{-6}$ kg - $100$ kg. The derived ${\\tau}$-values have a median of\n${\\tau}_{median}$ = 2.17 %. Most of them are on the order of 0.1 % - 10 %. We\npresent how our values were obtained, compare them with data reported in the\nliterature, and discuss several methods. A dependence of ${\\tau}$ on the\npre-atmospheric velocity of the meteor, $v_e$, is noticeable with a relation of\n${\\tau}=0.0023 \\cdot v_e^{2.3}$. The higher luminous efficiency of fast meteors\ncould be explained by the higher energy released. Fast meteoroids produce\nadditional emission lines that radiate more efficiently in specific wavelengths\ndue to the appearance of the so-called second component of higher temperature.\nFurthermore, a dependence of ${\\tau}$ on the initial meteoroid mass, $M_e$, was\nfound, with negative linear behaviour in log-log space: ${\\tau}=0.48 \\cdot\nM_e^{-0.47}$. This implies that the radiation of smaller meteoroids is more\nefficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 08:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

In this work, we propose to model user-item interactions as a\nheterogeneous graph which consists of not only user-item edges indicating their\ninteraction but also user-user edges indicating their similarity. We develop\nheterogeneous graph collaborative filtering (HGCF), a GCN-based framework which\ncan explicitly capture both the interaction signal and similarity signal\nthrough embedding propagation on the heterogeneous graph. Since the\nheterogeneous graph is more connected than the bipartite graph, the sparsity\nissue can be alleviated and the demand for expensive high-order connectivity\nmodeling can be lowered.

We hypothesize that limiting the number of Hebbian learning\nrules through a \"genomic bottleneck\" can act as a regularizer leading to better\ngeneralization across changes to the environment. We test this hypothesis by\ndecoupling the number of Hebbian learning rules from the number of synapses and\nsystematically varying the number of Hebbian learning rules. The results in\nthis paper suggest that simultaneously learning the Hebbian learning rules and\ntheir assignment to synapses is a difficult optimization problem, leading to\npoor performance in the environments tested.

The main challenge for\nsuch systems is to provide incentives to users to contribute high-quality\nmodels trained from their local data.

Differs from the classical coordinate descent algorithms, HCD provides\nthree strategies to speed up the convergence: warm start initialization, active\nset updating, and strong rule for active set initialization. The active set is\npre-selected using a strong rule, then the coordinates of the active set are\nupdated while those of inactive set are unchanged. The homotopy strategy\nprovides a set of warm start initial solutions for a sequence of decreasing\nvalues of the regularization factor, which ensures all iterations along the\nhomotopy solution path are sparse. Computational experiments on simulate\nsignals and natural signals demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithm, in accurately and efficiently reconstructing sparse solutions of the\n$l_0$-LS problem, whether the observation is noisy or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 10:02:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-16"}

Within the community of AO the\nfirst choice solver is the so called Matrix Vector Multiplication (MVM), which\ndirectly applies the (regularized) generalized inverse of the system operator\nto the data. For small telescopes this approach is feasible, however, for\nlarger systems such as the European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), the\natmospheric tomography problem is considerably more complex and the\ncomputational efficiency becomes an issue. Iterative methods, such as the\nFinite Element Wavelet Hybrid Algorithm (FEWHA), are a promising alternative.\nFEWHA is a wavelet based reconstructor that uses the well-known iterative\npreconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method as a solver. The number of\nfloating point operations and memory usage are decreased significantly by using\na matrix-free representation of the forward operator. A crucial indicator for\nthe real-time performance are the number of PCG iterations. In this paper, we\npropose an augmented version of FEWHA, where the number of iterations is\ndecreased by $50\\%$ using a Krylov subspace recycling technique. We demonstrate\nthat a parallel implementation of augmented FEWHA allows the fulfilment of the\nreal-time requirements of the ELT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 10:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-16"}

The HD\n41004 binary system consists of a K1 V primary star and an M2 V secondary; both\nstars are host to a massive planet or brown dwarf. Analogous to planets in our\nsolar system that emit at radio wavelengths due to their strong magnetic\nfields, one or both of the planet or brown dwarf in the HD 41004 binary system\nare also thought to be sources of radio emission. Various models predict\nHD~41004Bb to have one of the largest expected flux densities at 150 MHz. The\nobservations at 150 MHz cover almost the entire orbital period of HD 41004Bb,\nand about $20\\%$ of the orbit is covered at 400 MHz.

In this paper, we tackle\nthis bottleneck and present an approach to leverage cross-domain learning,\nbased on labeled documents and sentences from news and tweets, as well as\npolitical speeches with a clear difference in their degrees of being\npropagandistic. We devise informative features and build various classifiers\nfor propaganda labeling, using cross-domain learning.

To do so, we use a data set of over\n350 million tweets and retweets posted by over 26 million English speaking\nTwitter users from January 13 to June 7, 2020. We characterize the retweet\nnetwork to identify spontaneous clustering of users and the evolution of their\ninteraction over time in relation to the pandemic's emergence. We identify\nseveral stable clusters (super-communities), and are able to link them to\ninternational groups mainly involved in science and health topics, national\nelites, and political actors. The science- and health-related super-community\nreceived disproportionate attention early on during the pandemic, and was\nleading the discussion at the time. However, as the pandemic unfolded, the\nattention shifted towards both national elites and political actors, paralleled\nby the introduction of country-specific containment measures and the growing\npoliticization of the debate. Scientific super-community remained present in\nthe discussion, but experienced less reach and became more isolated within the\nnetwork. Overall, the emerging network communities are characterized by an\nincreased self-amplification and polarization. This makes it generally harder\nfor information from international health organizations or scientific\nauthorities to directly reach a broad audience through Twitter for prolonged\ntime. These results may have implications for information dissemination along\nthe unfolding of long-term events like epidemic diseases on a world-wide scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 10:27:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 14:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

The representer theorem is applied\nto find among all solutions of a dynamic equation the one that minimizes the\nerror with given spatio-temporal samples. This is motivated by the fact that\nvery often a differential equation is given a priori (e.g.~by the laws of\nphysics) and a practitioner seeks the best solution that is compatible with her\nnoisy measurements.

Following this observation,\ntransductive ZSL (T-ZSL) assumes that unseen classes and their associated\nimages are known during training, but not their correspondence. As current\nT-ZSL approaches do not scale efficiently when the number of seen classes is\nhigh, we tackle this problem with a new model for T-ZSL based upon CycleGAN.\nOur model jointly (i) projects images on their seen class labels with a\nsupervised objective and (ii) aligns unseen class labels and visual exemplars\nwith adversarial and cycle-consistency objectives.

Cygnus X-3 is\namongst the list of X-ray binaries that show quite complex behavior, with\nvarious distinct spectral states. Because of its softness and intrinsic low\nflux above typically 50 keV, very little is known about the hard X/soft\ngamma-ray (100-1000 keV) emission in Cygnus X-3. Using the whole INTEGRAL data\nbase, we aim to explore the 3-1000 keV spectra of Cygnus X-3. This allows to\nprobe this region with the highest sensitivity ever, and search for the\npotential signature of a high-energy non-thermal component as sometimes seen in\nother sources. Our work is based on state classification carried out in\nprevious studies with data from the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer. We extend this\nclassification to the whole INTEGRAL data set and perform a long-term\nstate-resolved spectral analysis. Six stacked spectra were obtained using 16\nyears of data from JEM-X, ISGRI, and SPI. We extract stacked images in three\ndifferent energy bands, and detect the source up to 200 keV. In the hardest\nstates, our phenomenological approach reveals the presence of an component > 50\nkeV in addition to the component usually interpreted as thermal Comptonization.\nWe apply a more physical model of hybrid thermal/nonthermal corona to\ncharacterize this component and compare our results with those of previous\nstudies. Our modeling indicates a more efficient acceleration of electrons in\nstates where major ejections are observed. We find a dependence of the photon\nindex of the power law as a function of the strong orbital modulation of the\nsource in the Flaring InterMediate (FIM) state.

A bigon is a simple\nelastic network consisting of two initially straight strips that are deformed\nto intersect with each other through a fixed intersection angle at each end. A\nbigon ring is a novel multistable structure composed of a series of bigons\narranged to form a loop. We find that a bigon ring usually contains several\nfamilies of stable states and one of them is a multiply-covered loop, which is\nsimilar to the folding behavior of a bandsaw blade. To model bigons and bigon\nrings, we propose a numerical framework combining several existing techniques\nto study mechanics of elastic networks consisting of thin strips. Each strip is\nmodeled as a Kirchhoff rod, and the entire strip network is formulated as a\ntwo-point boundary value problem (BVP) that can be solved by a general-purpose\nBVP solver. Together with numerical continuation, we apply the numerical\nframework to study static equilibria and bifurcations of the bigons and bigon\nrings. Both numerical and experimental results show that the intersection angle\nand the aspect ratio of the strip's cross section contribute to the bistability\nof a bigon and the multistability of a bigon ring; the latter also depends on\nthe number of bigon cells in the ring. The numerical results further reveal\ninteresting connections among various stable states in a bigon ring.

Such\ngels are ubiquitous in everyday life applications, from food products to paints\nor construction materials, in particular thanks to their ability to easily\n\"yield\", i.e., to turn from a solid to a liquid under the application of a weak\nexternal load. Understanding and controlling the mechanical response of\ncolloidal gels is therefore of prime importance. Depending on the details of\nthe system, however, the resulting gel networks present different\nmicrostructural organisations that may lead to widely different mechanical\nresponses. This raises important challenges in fully characterizing yielding\nand in uncovering the mechanisms of nonlinear response in colloidal gels. In\nthis paper, we distinguish between two classes of colloidal gels showing\nrespectively reversible yielding, where the gel network reforms upon load\nrelease, and irreversible yielding, where the network is fully destroyed\nthrough fractures and phase separation. This broad, empirical distinction is\nachieved through rheology and local experiments at a mesoscopic scale,\nintermediate between the network characteristic size and the sample size. We\nfurther discuss how the observables derived from creep and fatigue experiments\nmay be modelled to predict yielding and highlight open questions and future\nresearch directions in the domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 14:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-16"}

Our method is based\non a shared mask generator, which separates the foreground object from its\nbackground, and captures the object's general pose and shape. To control the\nsource of the identity of the output frame, we employ perturbations to\ninterrupt the unwanted identity information on the driver's mask. A\nmask-refinement module then replaces the identity of the driver with the\nidentity of the source. Conditioned on the source image, the transformed mask\nis then decoded by a multi-scale generator that renders a realistic image, in\nwhich the content of the source frame is animated by the pose in the driving\nvideo.

The goal is to maximize $\\min_i f_i(S_i)$ where $S_1,\\dotsc,S_m$ is a\npartition of the resources.

The main idea is to reduce the stiffness of the problem by\nsubtracting a least-squares penalty on the gradient jumps across the mesh\ninterfaces from the standard stiffness bilinear form. This penalty bilinear\nform is similar to the known technique used to stabilize finite element\napproximations in various contexts. The penalty term is designed to dampen the\nhigh frequencies in the spectrum and so it is weighted here by a negative\ncoefficient. The resulting approximation technique is called softFEM since it\nreduces the stiffness of the problem. The two key advantages of softFEM over\nthe standard Galerkin FEM are to improve the approximation of the eigenvalues\nin the upper part of the discrete spectrum and to reduce the condition number\nof the stiffness matrix. We derive a sharp upper bound on the softness\nparameter weighting the stabilization bilinear form so as to maintain\ncoercivity for the softFEM bilinear form. Then we prove that softFEM delivers\nthe same optimal convergence rates as the standard Galerkin FEM approximation\nfor the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors. We next compare the discrete\neigenvalues obtained when using Galerkin FEM and softFEM. Finally, a detailed\nanalysis of linear softFEM for the 1D Laplace eigenvalue problem delivers a\nsensible choice for the softness parameter. With this choice, the stiffness\nreduction ratio scales linearly with the polynomial degree. Various numerical\nexperiments illustrate the benefits of using softFEM over Galerkin FEM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 14:58:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 11:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

All of these methods rely on the availability of several suitable\nanalytically tractable estimating equations, and this is sometimes problematic.\nWe propose an easy-to-use empirical likelihood ABC method in this article.\nFirst, by using a variational approximation argument as a motivation, we show\nthat the target log-posterior can be approximated as a sum of an expected joint\nlog-likelihood and the differential entropy of the data generating density. The\nexpected log-likelihood is then estimated by an empirical likelihood where the\nonly inputs required are a choice of summary statistic, it's observed value,\nand the ability to simulate the chosen summary statistics for any parameter\nvalue under the model. The differential entropy is estimated from the simulated\nsummaries using traditional methods. Posterior consistency is established for\nthe method, and we discuss the bounds for the required number of simulated\nsummaries in detail. The performance of the proposed method is explored in\nvarious examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 21:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

This type of distress is caused by permanent deformation and shear\nfailure of the asphalt mix under the repetition of heavy loads. The Hamburg\nwheel tracking test (HWTT) is a widely used testing procedure designed to\naccelerate, and to simulate the rutting phenomena in the laboratory. Rut depth,\nas one of the outputs of the HWTT, is dependent on a number of parameters\nrelated to mix design and testing conditions. This study introduces a new model\nfor predicting the rutting depth of asphalt mixtures using a deep learning\ntechnique - the convolution neural network (CNN). A database containing a\ncomprehensive collection of HWTT results was used to develop a CNN-based\nmachine learning prediction model. The database includes 10,000 rutting depth\ndata points measured across a large variety of asphalt mixtures. The model has\nbeen formulated in terms of known influencing mixture variables such as asphalt\nbinder high temperature performance grade, mixture type, aggregate size,\naggregate gradation, asphalt content, total asphalt binder recycling content,\nand testing parameters, including testing temperature and number of wheel\npasses. A rigorous validation process was used to assess the accuracy of the\nmodel to predict total rut depth and the HWTT rutting curve. A sensitivity\nanalysis is presented, which evaluates the effect of the investigated variables\non rutting depth predictions by the CNN model. The model can be used as a tool\nto estimate the rut depth in asphalt mixtures when laboratory testing is not\nfeasible, or for cost saving, pre-design trials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 22:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

In this work, we\nstudy learning such utility from human demonstrations. While inverse\nreinforcement learning (IRL) has been accepted as a general framework of\nutility learning, its fundamental formulation is one concrete Markov Decision\nProcess. Thus the learned reward function does not specify the task\nindependently of the environment. Going beyond that, we define a domain of\ngeneralization that spans a set of planning problems following a schema. We\nhence propose a new quest, Generalized Inverse Planning, for utility learning\nin this domain. We further outline a computational framework, Maximum Entropy\nInverse Planning (MEIP), that learns non-Markovian utility and associated\nconcepts in a generative manner. The learned utility and concepts form a task\nrepresentation that generalizes regardless of probability shift or structural\nchange. Seeing that the proposed generalization problem has not been widely\nstudied yet, we carefully define an evaluation protocol, with which we\nillustrate the effectiveness of MEIP on two proof-of-concept domains and one\nchallenging task: learning to fold from demonstrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 21:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

The typical\nhazard management approach for this type of roof fall hazard relies heavily on\nvisual inspections and expert knowledge. In this study, we propose an\nartificial intelligence (AI) based system for the detection roof fall hazards\ncaused by high horizontal stresses. We use images depicting hazardous and\nnon-hazardous roof conditions to develop a convolutional neural network for\nautonomous detection of hazardous roof conditions. To compensate for limited\ninput data, we utilize a transfer learning approach. In transfer learning, an\nalready-trained network is used as a starting point for classification in a\nsimilar domain. Results confirm that this approach works well for classifying\nroof conditions as hazardous or safe, achieving a statistical accuracy of 86%.\nHowever, accuracy alone is not enough to ensure a reliable hazard management\nsystem. System constraints and reliability are improved when the features being\nused by the network are understood. Therefore, we used a deep learning\ninterpretation technique called integrated gradients to identify the important\ngeologic features in each image for prediction. The analysis of integrated\ngradients shows that the system mimics expert judgment on roof fall hazard\ndetection. The system developed in this paper demonstrates the potential of\ndeep learning in geological hazard management to complement human experts, and\nlikely to become an essential part of autonomous tunneling operations in those\ncases where hazard identification heavily depends on expert knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 17:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}
