All of these fields have developed methods for rating\ncompetitors and ranking them accordingly. A tournament is intransitive if it is\nnot consistent with any ranking. Intransitive tournaments contain\nrock-paper-scissor type cycles. The discrete Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition\n(HHD) is well adapted to describing intransitive tournaments. It separates a\ntournament into perfectly transitive and perfectly cyclic components, where the\nperfectly transitive component is associated with a set of ratings. The size of\nthe cyclic component can be used as a measure of intransitivity. Here we show\nthat the HHD arises naturally from two classes of tournaments with simple\nstatistical interpretations. We then discuss six different sets of assumptions\nthat define equivalent decompositions. This analysis motivates the choice to\nuse the HHD among other existing methods. Success in competition is typically\nmediated by the traits of the competitors. A trait-performance model assumes\nthat the probability that one competitor beats another can be expressed as a\nfunction of their traits. We show that, if the traits of each competitor are\ndrawn independently and identically from a trait distribution then the expected\ndegree of intransitivity in the network can be computed explicitly. Using this\nresult we show that increasing the number of pairs of competitors who could\ncompete promotes cyclic competition, and that increasing the correlation in the\nperformance of $A$ against $B$ with the performance of $A$ against $C$ promotes\ntransitive competition. The expected size of cyclic competition can thus be\nunderstood by analyzing this correlation.

In this regard, we make three main contributions. (a) Propose a novel\nbehavior-based model as opposed to individual transactions-based models\ncurrently used by financial institutions. We introduce behavior traces as\nenriched relational representation to represent observed human behavior. (b) A\nmodelling approach that observes these traces and is able to accurately infer\nthe goals of actors by classifying the behavior into money laundering or\nstandard behavior despite significant unobserved activity. And (c) a synthetic\nbehavior simulator that can generate new previously unseen traces. The\nsimulator incorporates a high level of flexibility in the behavioral parameters\nso that we can challenge the detection algorithm. Finally, we provide\nexperimental results that show that the learning module (automated\ninvestigator) that has only partial observability can still successfully infer\nthe type of behavior, and thus the simulated goals, followed by customers based\non traces - a key aspiration for many applications today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 16:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

While the interface\ncoincides with the mid-layer of a uniform interphase, we argue that this\nassumption fails to sufficiently capture the behavior of graded or\ninhomogeneous interphases. This contribution extends the formulation of the\ngeneral interface model to account for arbitrary interface positions.

Ubiquitous models, which are relevant to the\ndescription of diverse nonlinear media are provided by the nonlinear\nSchrodinger (NLS), alias Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations.

Previous efforts\nhave explored reduced precision in the preconditioner, but the use of reduced\nprecision in the solver itself has received limited attention. We found that\nGMRES only needs double precision in computing the residual and updating the\napproximate solution to achieve double-precision accuracy, although it must\nrestart after each improvement of single-precision accuracy. This finding holds\nfor the tested orthogonalization schemes: Modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) and\nClassical Gram-Schmidt with Re-orthogonalization (CGSR).

(a) We engineer an\nensemble of deep learning models that combines the strengths of\nstate-of-the-art approaches, (b) we incorporate a tuning factor into this\nframework that leverages transfer learning to conduct automated hate speech\nclassification on unlabeled datasets, like Gab, and (c) we develop a weak\nsupervised learning methodology that allows our framework to train on unlabeled\ndata. Our ensemble models achieve an 83% hate recall on the HON dataset,\nsurpassing the performance of the state-of-the-art deep models. We demonstrate\nthat weak supervised training in combination with classifier tuning\nsignificantly increases model performance on unlabeled data from Gab, achieving\na hate recall of 67%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 17:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

As a consequence, we obtain general relations for\nthe diagonal entries of a square symmetric matrix without zeros, we provide an\nexpression of the gravitational potential, suitable, to represent several\ndifferent mass density configurations, and we determine relations for the\nsemi-axes of a triaxial spheroidal mass distribution, as a function of the\nspheroid mass density, volume density and radius. In the second part of this\nmanuscript, we employ the tools developed in the first part, to analyse the\nmass density content and the inner and global structure of the dark matter\nhaloes of UGC 8490 and UGC 9753, through the fits to the dark matter rotation\ncurves of the two galaxies, assuming a triaxial spheroidal dark matter mass\nconfiguration. We employ the Navarro Frenk and White, Burkert, DiCintio,\nEinasto and Stadel dark matter models, and we obtain that both a cored Burkert\nand cuspy DiCintio and Navarro Frenk and White inward dark matter distributions\ncould represent equally well the observed data, furthermore we determine an\noblate spheroidal dark matter mass density configuration for UGC 8490 and UGC\n9753. The latter outcome is confirmed by the estimation of the gravitational\ntorques exerted by the dark matter halo of each analysed galaxy, on the\ncorresponding baryonic components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 17:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

Contrary to previous works, our\nmethod does not require to manually select key frames, and produces\nstate-of-the-art results with as little as $2\\%$ of annotated frames, which are\n\\textit{randomly chosen}. To this end, we propose a semi-supervised learning\napproach where a spatio-temporal model combining a feature extractor and a\ntemporal module are learned in two stages. The first stage uses datasets of\nunlabeled videos to learn a strong spatio-temporal representation of facial\nbehavior dynamics based on contrastive learning. To our knowledge we are the\nfirst to build upon this framework for modeling facial behavior in an\nunsupervised manner. The second stage uses another dataset of randomly chosen\nlabeled frames to train a regressor on top of our spatio-temporal model for\nestimating the AU intensity. We show that although backpropagation through time\nis applied only with respect to the output of the network for extremely sparse\nand randomly chosen labeled frames, our model can be effectively trained to\nestimate AU intensity accurately, thanks to the unsupervised pre-training of\nthe first stage. We experimentally validate that our method outperforms\nexisting methods when working with as little as $2\\%$ of randomly chosen data\nfor both DISFA and BP4D datasets, without a careful choice of labeled frames, a\ntime-consuming task still required in previous approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 17:35:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 09:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-05"}

In particular, we show that the method achieves a convergence in\nexpectation at a rate $\\mathcal{O}(1/k^{2/3})$, where $k$ is the number of\niterations.

Most learning-based registration algorithms, including joint\noptimization approaches, currently suffer from bias due to selection of a fixed\nreference frame and only support pairwise transformations. We here propose an\nanalytical framework based on an unbiased learning strategy for group-wise\nregistration that simultaneously registers images to the mean space of a group\nto obtain consistent segmentations. We evaluate the proposed method on\nlongitudinal analysis of a white matter tract in a brain MRI dataset with 2-3\ntime-points for 3249 individuals, i.e., 8045 images in total. The\nreproducibility of the method is evaluated on test-retest data from 97\nindividuals. The results confirm that the implicit reference image is an\naverage of the input image. In addition, the proposed framework leads to\nconsistent segmentations and significantly lower processing bias than that of a\npair-wise fixed-reference approach. This processing bias is even smaller than\nthose obtained when translating segmentations by only one voxel, which can be\nattributed to subtle numerical instabilities and interpolation. Therefore, we\npostulate that the proposed mean-space learning strategy could be widely\napplied to learning-based registration tasks. In addition, this group-wise\nframework introduces a novel way for learning-based longitudinal studies by\ndirect construction of an unbiased within-subject template and allowing\nreliable and efficient analysis of spatio-temporal imaging biomarkers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 17:44:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 09:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-25"}

We\ndemonstrate the potential of this approach by recovering the fundamental\nhierarchy of plasma physics models -- from the Vlasov equation to\nmagnetohydrodynamics. Our findings show that this data-driven methodology\noffers a promising new route to accelerate the development of reduced\ntheoretical models of complex nonlinear plasma phenomena and to design\ncomputationally efficient algorithms for multi-scale plasma simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 18:58:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 21:20:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2022 17:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

One particular question that often arises as a barrier to\nadopting deep learning for financial services is whether the developed\nfinancial deep learning models are fair in their predictions, particularly in\nlight of strong governance and regulatory compliance requirements in the\nfinancial services industry. A fundamental aspect of fairness that has not been\nexplored in financial deep learning is the concept of trust, whose variations\nmay point to an egocentric view of fairness and thus provide insights into the\nfairness of models. In this study we explore the feasibility and utility of a\nmulti-scale trust quantification strategy to gain insights into the fairness of\na financial deep learning model, particularly under different scenarios at\ndifferent scales. More specifically, we conduct multi-scale trust\nquantification on a deep neural network for the purpose of credit card default\nprediction to study: 1) the overall trustworthiness of the model 2) the trust\nlevel under all possible prediction-truth relationships, 3) the trust level\nacross the spectrum of possible predictions, 4) the trust level across\ndifferent demographic groups (e.g., age, gender, and education), and 5)\ndistribution of overall trust for an individual prediction scenario. The\ninsights for this proof-of-concept study demonstrate that such a multi-scale\ntrust quantification strategy may be helpful for data scientists and regulators\nin financial services as part of the verification and certification of\nfinancial deep learning solutions to gain insights into fairness and trust of\nthese solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 19:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-05"}

Despite many\ntechnological disruptions, one of the most fundamental and widely used\nfunctions within traffic modelling, the volume delay function, has seen little\nin the way of change since it was developed in the 1960's. Traditionally\nmacroscopic methods have been employed to relate traffic volume to vehicular\njourney time.

However, these prescriptions are primarily phenomenological, with\nonly crude connections to the physics of galaxy evolution. Here we introduce a\nset of galaxy models that are based on a simple physical framework but\nincorporate more sophisticated models of feedback, star formation, and other\nprocesses. We apply these models to the high-redshift regime, showing that most\nof the generic predictions of the simplest models remain valid. In particular,\nthe stellar mass--halo mass relation depends almost entirely on the physics of\nfeedback (and is thus independent of the details of small-scale star formation)\nand the specific star formation rate is a simple multiple of the cosmological\naccretion rate. We also show that, in contrast, the galaxy's gas mass is\nsensitive to the physics of star formation, although the inclusion of\nfeedback-driven star formation laws significantly changes the naive\nexpectations. While these models are far from detailed enough to describe every\naspect of galaxy formation, they inform our understanding of galaxy formation\nby illustrating several generic aspects of that process, and they provide a\nphysically-grounded basis for extrapolating predictions to faint galaxies and\nhigh redshifts currently out of reach of observations.

Our simulations show that, when evaluated in\nterms of the Brody parameter, resonance statistics do not change or change\ninsignificantly with rising temperature if temperature is the only changing\nparameter. In the experiments evaluated, temperature was changed simultaneously\nwith optical dipole trap depth. Thus, simulations included the Stark shift\nbased on the known polarizability of the free atoms and assuming their\npolarizability remains the same in the bound state. Somewhat surprisingly, we\nfound that, while including the Stark shift does lead to minor statistical\nchanges, it does not change the resonance statistics and, therefore, is not\nresponsible for the experimentally observed statistic transformation. This\nobservation suggests that either our assumption regarding the polarizability of\nFeshbach molecules is poor or that an additional mechanism changes the\nstatistics and leads to more chaotic statistical behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 19:52:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

While this addresses the bias, this has the side effect of\nsignificantly increasing the number of data samples required to accurately\nestimate the effect due to the increased dimensionality. In this work, we\nconsider the setting where out of a large number of covariates $X$ that satisfy\nstrong ignorability, an unknown sparse subset $S$ is sufficient to include to\nachieve zero bias, i.e. $c$-equivalent to $X$. We propose a common objective\nfunction involving outcomes across treatment cohorts with nonconvex joint\nsparsity regularization that is guaranteed to recover $S$ with high probability\nunder a linear outcome model for $Y$ and subgaussian covariates for each of the\ntreatment cohort. This improves the effect estimation sample complexity so that\nit scales with the cardinality of the sparse subset $S$ and $\\log |X|$, as\nopposed to the cardinality of the full set $X$.

By contrast, for very large\ncoupling strength, the systems hybridize and form compounds that cannot be\ndescribed in terms of light or matter only. In this Thesis, we study some\nexotic properties which arise in this regime. In particular, we are interested\nin the possibility to engineer quantum phase transitions in these systems. One\ndirection we explore is the study of two-photon coupling, a mechanism in which\nmatter creates or absorb photons by pairs. This mechanism creates a rich phase\ndiagram containing both phase transitions and instabilities. A second topic is\nthe use of these transitions for sensing applications. Indeed, near the\ncritical point, the system becomes extremely sensitive to external\nperturbations. We study a setup in which a single qubit is coupled to a bosonic\nfield. We show that even this finite-size system displays a phase transition,\nwhich can be used to measure the frequency of the qubit and the field with\nimproved accuracy. This protocol could be used to develop small-scale sensors.\nFinally, we study how the ability of a system to perform certain metrological\ntasks could be used to characterize and quantify nonclassicality, by using the\nformalism of resource theories.

An optimizer guided by the local gradient is often\ntrapped in local optima when the loss landscape is multi-modal. A directional\nGaussian smoothing (DGS) approach was recently proposed in (Zhang et al., 2020)\nand used to define a truly nonlocal gradient, referred to as the DGS gradient,\nfor high-dimensional black-box optimization. Promising results show that\nreplacing the traditional local gradient with the DGS gradient can\nsignificantly improve the performance of gradient-based methods in optimizing\nhighly multi-modal loss functions. However, the optimal performance of the DGS\ngradient may rely on fine tuning of two important hyper-parameters, i.e., the\nsmoothing radius and the learning rate.

Since the DGS\ngradient generally points to a good search direction, we perform a line search\nalong the DGS direction to determine the step size at each iteration.

We begin with the single location variant. Specifically, requests\narrive in an online fashion at a single location. The algorithm must then\nchoose between matching a pair of requests or delaying them to be matched later\non. The cost is defined by a concave function on the delay. Given linear or\neven convex delay functions, matching any two available requests is trivially\noptimal. However, this does not extend to concave delays. We solve this by\nproviding an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm that is defined through a series of\ndelay counters.\n  Thereafter we consider the problem given an underlying $n$-points metric. The\ncost of a matching is then defined as the connection cost (as defined by the\nmetric) plus the delay cost. Given linear delays, this problem was introduced\nby Emek et al. and dubbed the Min-cost perfect matching with linear delays\n(MPMD) problem. Liu et al. considered convex delays and subsequently asked\nwhether there exists a solution with small competitive ratio given concave\ndelays. We show this to be true by extending our single location algorithm and\nproving $O(\\log n)$ competitiveness. Finally, we turn our focus to the\nbichromatic case, wherein requests have polarities and only opposite polarities\nmay be matched.

Indeed, 1) the number of samples required for a certain\naccuracy is log-linear in the resolution of the signal space, and depends only\nweakly on the dimension of the redundant time-frequency space, and 2) the\nquasi-random samples have low discrepancy, so they are spread evenly in the\nredundant time-frequency space.

This approach is demonstrated on a mathematical\nmodel of aero-elastic flutter, where good agreement at the level of the\nbifurcation diagrams is shown between the hybrid model and the underlying\nground truth. Moreover, individual phase portraits and time series are also\nreproduced accurately, even in regions away from training data. As such, the\napproach holds significant promise for producing quantitatively accurate models\nthat exhibit the correct nonlinear behaviour over a range of parameter values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 22:26:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 16:53:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 17:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Due to the open challenge in finding perfect Bayesian equilibria of\nsuch games, existing studies often consider approximated solutions composed of\nparameter estimation and motion planning steps, in order to decouple the belief\nand physical dynamics. In parameter estimation, current approaches often assume\nthat the reward parameters of the robot are known by the humans.

We test this argument by studying a two-vehicle\nuncontrolled intersection case with short reaction time. Results show that when\nboth agents are unknowingly aggressive (or non-aggressive), empathy leads to\nmore effective parameter estimation and higher reward values, suggesting that\nempathy is necessary when the true parameters of agents mismatch with their\ncommon belief. The proposed estimation and planning algorithms are therefore\nmore robust than the existing approaches, by fully acknowledging the nature of\ninformation asymmetry in HRI.

Attenuation in both strength and\npropagation speed of the leading shock is mainly caused by momentum transfer to\nthe droplets that interact at the shock front.

One approach to support this scale is with\ndistributed serving, or distributed inference, which divides the memory\nrequirements of a single large model across multiple servers.\n  This work is a first-step for the systems research community to develop novel\nmodel-serving solutions, given the huge system design space. Large-scale deep\nrecommender systems are a novel workload and vital to study, as they consume up\nto 79% of all inference cycles in the data center. To that end, this work\ndescribes and characterizes scale-out deep learning recommendation inference\nusing data-center serving infrastructure. This work specifically explores\nlatency-bounded inference systems, compared to the throughput-oriented training\nsystems of other recent works. We find that the latency and compute overheads\nof distributed inference are largely a result of a model's static embedding\ntable distribution and sparsity of input inference requests. We further\nevaluate three embedding table mapping strategies of three DLRM-like models and\nspecify challenging design trade-offs in terms of end-to-end latency, compute\noverhead, and resource efficiency. Overall, we observe only a marginal latency\noverhead when the data-center scale recommendation models are served with the\ndistributed inference manner--P99 latency is increased by only 1% in the best\ncase configuration. The latency overheads are largely a result of the commodity\ninfrastructure used and the sparsity of embedding tables.

Second, we\nobserve that, in many circumstances, we can also safely cache or avoid\nreplication operations needed for I/O related system calls. Our evaluation\nshows that dMVX reduces the performance degradation from over 50% to 3.1% for\nrealistic server benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 01:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-05"}

These coherent\nstructures are generated and sustained through nonlinear evolution of\nbaroclinic instability.

It is found that the particles in\nthe central region organize into inclined lobes, each associated with an eddy,\nand the filaments associated with the heavy- and light-edges of the front\ntransfer edge particles to the lobes. This flux of new particles into the lobe\ncauses local particles to adjust, which leads to slumping of the front.

High-order information can\nalleviate the cold-start issue of CF-based methods, which is modelled through\npropagating the information over the user-item bipartite graph. Recent Graph\nNeural Networks~(GNNs) propose to stack multiple aggregation layers to\npropagate high-order signals. However, the oscillation problem, varying\nlocality of bipartite graph, and the fix propagation pattern spoil the ability\nof multi-layer structure to propagate information. The oscillation problem\nresults from the bipartite structure, as the information from users only\npropagates to items. Besides oscillation problem, varying locality suggests the\ndensity of nodes should be considered in the propagation process. Moreover, the\nlayer-fixed propagation pattern introduces redundant information between\nlayers. In order to tackle these problems, we propose a new RS model, named as\n\\textbf{D}eoscillated \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{C}ollaborative\n\\textbf{F}iltering~(DGCF).

In this paper, a multi-task network is proposed\nto address both ref-delay estimation and echo cancellation tasks. The proposed\narchitecture consists of two convolutional recurrent networks (CRNNs) to\nestimate the echo and enhanced signals separately, as well as a fully-connected\n(FC) network to estimate the echo path delay.

This sort of\nsituation leads an interesting family of planning problems in which the robot\nis limited in what it sees and must, thus, choose what to pay attention to. The\ndistinguishing characteristic of this setting is that the robot has influence\nover what it captures via its sensors, but exercises no causal authority over\nthe evolving process. As such, the robot's objective is to observe the\nunderlying process and to produce a `chronicle' of occurrent events, subject to\na goal specification of the sorts of event sequences that may be of interest.\nThis paper examines variants of such problems when the robot aims to collect\nsets of observations to meet a rich specification of their sequential\nstructure.

Most theoretical studies take a searcher-centric viewpoint,\nfocusing on the first passage time (FTP) problem to find a target. This single\nsearch-and-capture event then triggers a downstream process or provides the\nsearcher with some resource such as food. In this paper we take a\ntarget-centric viewpoint, by considering the accumulation of resources in one\nor more targets due to multiple rounds of search-and-capture events combined\nwith resource degradation; whenever a searcher finds a target it delivers a\nresource packet to the target, after which it escapes and returns to its\ninitial position. The searcher is then resupplied with cargo and a new search\nprocess is initiated after a random delay. It has previously been show how\nqueuing theory can be used to derive general expressions for the steady-state\nmean and variance of the resulting resource distributions. Here we apply the\ntheory to some classical FPT problems involving diffusion in simple geometries\nwith absorbing boundaries, including concentric spheres, wedge domains, and\nbranching networks. In each case, we determine how the resulting Fano factor\ndepends on the degradation rate, the delay distribution, and various geometric\nparameters.

Given its\nlimited storage space, it is important for the edge server at the base station\n(BS) to determine which service programs to cache by meeting and guiding WDs'\noffloading decisions. In this paper, we propose an MEC service pricing scheme\nto coordinate with the service caching decisions and control WDs' task\noffloading behavior. We propose a two-stage dynamic game of incomplete\ninformation to model and analyze the two-stage interaction between the BS and\nmultiple associated WDs. Specifically, in Stage I, the BS determines the MEC\nservice caching and announces the service program prices to the WDs, with the\nobjective to maximize its expected profit under both storage and computation\nresource constraints. In Stage II, given the prices of different service\nprograms, each WD selfishly decides its offloading decision to minimize\nindividual service delay and cost, without knowing the other WDs' desired\nprogram types or local execution delays. Despite the lack of WD's information\nand the coupling of all the WDs' offloading decisions, we derive the optimal\nthreshold-based offloading policy that can be easily adopted by the WDs in\nStage II at the Bayesian equilibrium. Then, by predicting the WDs' offloading\nequilibrium, we jointly optimize the BS' pricing and service caching in Stage I\nvia a low-complexity algorithm. In particular, we study both the uniform and\ndifferentiated pricing schemes. For differentiated pricing, we prove that the\nsame price should be charged to the cached programs of the same workload.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 06:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-05"}

Astrometry is in principle less sensitive to stellar activity because\nthe situation is more favourable: the stellar astrometric signal is expected to\nbe fainter than the planetary astrometric signal compared to radial velocities.\nWe quantify the effect of stellar activity on high-precision astrometry when\nEarth-mass planets are searched for in the habitable zone around old\nmain-sequence solar-type stars. We used a very large set of magnetic activity\nsynthetic time series to characterise the properties of the stellar astrometric\nsignal. We then studied the detectability of exoplanets based on different\napproaches: first based on the theoretical level of false positives derived\nfrom the synthetic time series, and then with blind tests for old main-sequence\nF6-K4 stars. The amplitude of the signal can be up to a few times the solar\nvalue depending on the assumptions made for activity level, spectral type, and\nspot contrast. The detection rates for 1 MEarth planets are very good, however,\nwith extremely low false-positive rates in the habitable zone for stars in the\nF6-K4 range at 10 pc. The standard false-alarm probability using classical\nbootstrapping on the time series strongly overestimates the false-positive\nlevel. This affects the detection rates. We conclude that if technological\nchallenges can be overcome and very high precision is reached, astrometry is\nmuch more suitable for detecting Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone\naround nearby solar-type stars than radial velocity, and detection rates are\nmuch higher for this range of planetary masses and periods when astrometric\ntechniques are used than with radial velocity techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 07:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

Structured (channel) pruning is usually applied to reduce the model\nredundancy while preserving the network structure, such that the pruned network\ncan be easily deployed in practice. However, existing structured pruning\nmethods require hand-crafted rules which may lead to tremendous pruning space.\nIn this paper, we introduce Differentiable Annealing Indicator Search (DAIS)\nthat leverages the strength of neural architecture search in the channel\npruning and automatically searches for the effective pruned model with given\nconstraints on computation overhead. Specifically, DAIS relaxes the binarized\nchannel indicators to be continuous and then jointly learns both indicators and\nmodel parameters via bi-level optimization. To bridge the non-negligible\ndiscrepancy between the continuous model and the target binarized model, DAIS\nproposes an annealing-based procedure to steer the indicator convergence\ntowards binarized states. Moreover, DAIS designs various regularizations based\non a priori structural knowledge to control the pruning sparsity and to improve\nmodel performance.

However, a majority\nof these approaches are based on supervised learning methods which requires\nhuge amount of manually annotated images.

This mapping is\nobtained by applying a similarity transform on the deformed Markov matrix of\nthe source model in order to obtain the deformed Markov matrix of the target\nmodel. We first derive this correspondence for periodic boundary conditions,\nand show in the diffusive scaling limit (corresponding to the Weakly Asymmetric\nSimple Exclusion Processes, or WASEP) how the mapping is expressed in the\nlanguage of Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory (MFT). As an interesting specific\ncase, we map the large deviations of current in the ASEP to the large\ndeviations of activity in the SSEP, thereby uncovering a regime of\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang in the distribution of activity in the SSEP. At large\nactivity, particle configurations exhibit hyperuniformity [Jack et al., PRL 114\n060601 (2015)]. Using results from quantum spin chain theory, we characterize\nthe hyperuniform regime by evaluating the small wavenumber asymptotic behavior\nof the structure factor at half-filling. Conversely, we formulate from the MFT\nresults a conjecture for a correlation function in spin chains at any fixed\ntotal magnetization (in the thermodynamic limit). In addition, we generalize\nthe mapping to the case of two open ASEPs with boundary reservoirs, and we\napply it in the WASEP limit in the MFT formalism. This mapping also allows us\nto find a symmetry-breaking dynamical phase transition (DPT) in the WASEP\nconditioned by activity, from the prior knowledge of a DPT in the WASEP\nconditioned by the current.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 09:57:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 22:18:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 09:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

While most experimental demonstrations of\nhigh-dimensional entanglement rely on fidelity-based witnesses, these are\npowerless to detect entanglement within a large class of entangled quantum\nstates, the so-called unfaithful states. In this paper, we introduce a highly\nflexible automated method to construct optimal tests for entanglement detection\ngiven a bipartite target state of arbitrary dimension, faithful or unfaithful,\nand a set of local measurement operators. By restricting the number or\ncomplexity of the considered measurement settings, our method outputs the most\nconvenient protocol which can be implemented using a wide range of experimental\ntechniques such as photons, superconducting qudits, cold atoms or trapped ions.\nWith an experimental quantum optics setup that can prepare and measure\narbitrary high-dimensional mixed states, we implement some $3$-setting\nprotocols generated by our method. These protocols allow us to experimentally\ncertify 2- and 3-unfaithful entanglement in 4-dimensional photonic states, some\nof which contain well above 50% of noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 10:38:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 09:24:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 03:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

Herein we present a novel approach to\nevaluate the quality of CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ layers, via in-situ monitoring of\nthe perovskite layer charge carrier dynamics during the thermal annealing\ncrystallization process, by means of time-resolved femtosecond transient\nabsorption spectroscopy (TAS). In particular, CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ films were\ndeposited on two types of polymeric hole transport layers (HTL),\npoly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly-(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and\npoly-(triarylamine) (PTAA), that are known to provide different carrier\ntransport characteristics in perovskite solar cells. In order to monitor the\nevolution of the perovskite charge carrier dynamics during the crystallization\nprocess, the so-formed CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$/HTL architectures were studied\nin-situ by TAS at three different annealing temperatures, i.e. 90, 100 and 110\noC. It is revealed that the annealing time period required in order to achieve\nthe optimum perovskite film quality in terms of the decay dynamics strongly\ndepends on the annealing temperature, as well as, on the employed HTL. For both\nHTLs, the required period decreases as higher annealing temperature is used,\nwhile, for the more hydrophobic PTAA polymer, longer annealing periods were\nrequired in order to obtain the optimum charge carrier dynamics. The\ncorrelation of the TAS finding with the structural and morphological features\nof the perovskite films is analysed and provides useful insights on the charge\nextraction dynamics and recombination processes in perovskite optoelectronic\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 10:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-05"}

Size downscaling renders magnetic properties more sensitive\nto thermal effects. Thus, understanding the temperature dependence of the\nmagnetic anisotropy is crucial. In this work, we theoretically address the\ncorrelation between temperature dependence of PMA and magnetization in typical\nFe/MgO-based structures. In particular, the possible mechanisms behind the\nexperiments reporting deviations from the Callen and Callen scaling power law\nare analyzed. At ideal interfaces, first-principles calculations reveal (i)\nsmall high-order anisotropy constants compared to first order and (ii) enhanced\nexchange constants. Considering these two intrinsic effects in the atomistic\nsimulations, the temperature-dependence of the total and layer-resolved\nanisotropy are found to follow the Callen and Callen scaling power law, thus\nruling out an intrinsic microscopic mechanism underlying deviations from this\nlaw. Besides, two possible extrinsic macroscopic mechanisms are unveiled namely\nthe influence of the dead layer, often present in the storage layer of STT-MRAM\ncells, and the spatial inhomogeneities of the interfacial magnetic anisotropy.\nAbout the first mechanism, we show that the presence of a dead layer tends to\nreduce the scaling exponents. In the second mechanism, increasing the\npercentage of inhomogeneity in the interfacial PMA is revealed to decrease the\nscaling exponent. These results allow us to explain the difference in scaling\nexponents relating anisotropy and magnetization thermal variations reported in\nearlier experiments. This is crucial for the understanding of the thermal\nstability of the storage layer magnetization in STT-MRAM applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 10:51:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 17:24:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 09:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

An ensemble-hierarchy relation also helps to\ndefine uniqueness through local feedback that may even be an action potential.\nThe earlier models are still consistent in terms of their proposed\nfunctionality, but some of the architecture boundaries have been moved to match\nthem up more closely.

This was achieved by removing the direct\nelectrical contact between the Si crystal and the metallic electrode, and by\nincreasing the phonon absorption efficiency of the sensors. The phonon signal\namplification in the detector shows a linear increase while the signal to noise\nratio improves with bias voltage, up to 240 V. This feature enables the\ndetector to operate at a low energy threshold which is beneficial for dark\nmatter and CE$\\nu$NS like searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 11:23:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 06:53:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

In the last two decades, numerous algorithms\nhave been proposed for obtaining information on the source camera and\ndistribution history of an image.

We demonstrate the usefulness of FODB in an evaluation of\nmethods for camera identification. We report three findings.

Our numerical analysis\nindicates that the medium-induced energy loss of the $\\Upsilon$(1S) results in\nstronger suppression at higher momentum, although the energy loss effects are\nfound to be small compared with the previous estimates of quarkonium\ndissociation in heavy-ion collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 12:21:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2021 09:37:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 07:54:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

Furthermore, the\ninefficient training process of teacher-student knowledge distillation also\nimpedes its applications in GNN models. In this paper, we propose the first\nteacher-free knowledge distillation method for GNNs, termed GNN\nSelf-Distillation (GNN-SD), that serves as a drop-in replacement of the\nstandard training process. The method is built upon the proposed neighborhood\ndiscrepancy rate (NDR), which quantifies the non-smoothness of the embedded\ngraph in an efficient way. Based on this metric, we propose the adaptive\ndiscrepancy retaining (ADR) regularizer to empower the transferability of\nknowledge that maintains high neighborhood discrepancy across GNN layers. We\nalso summarize a generic GNN-SD framework that could be exploited to induce\nother distillation strategies.

To analyse the\nobserved distributions in light of the H2CS binding energy, in order to discuss\nthe role of thermal desorption in enriching the gas disk component. Methods: In\nthe context of the ALMA chemical survey of Disk-Outflow sources in the Taurus\nstar forming region (ALMA-DOT), we observed five Class I or early Class II\nsources with the o-H2CS(7_1,6-6_1,5) line on a 40 au scale. We estimated the\nbinding energy (BEs) of H2CS using quantum mechanical calculations, for the\nfirst time, for an extended, periodic, crystalline ice. Results: We imaged H2CS\nin two rotating molecular rings in the HL Tau and IRAS04302+2247 disks. The\nouter radii are about 140 au (HL Tau), and 115 au (IRAS 04302+2247). The\nedge-on geometry of IRAS 04302+2247 reveals that H2CS emission peaks, at radii\nof 60-115 au, at z = +- 50 au from the equatorial plane. The column densities\nare about 10^14 cm^-2. For HL Tau, we derive, for the first time, the\n[H2CS]/[H] abundance in a protoplanetary disk (about 10^-14). The BEs of H2CS\ncomputed for extended crystalline ice and amorphous ices is 4258 K and\n3000-4600 K, respectively, implying a thermal evaporation where dust\ntemperature is larger than 50-80 K. Conclusions: H2CS traces the so-called warm\nmolecular layer, a region previously sampled using CS, and H2CO.\nThioformaldehyde peaks closer to the protostar than H2CO and CS, plausibly due\nto the relatively high-excitation level of observed 7_1,6-6_1,5 line (60 K).\nThe H2CS BEs implies that thermal desorption dominates in thin, au-sized, inner\nand/or upper disk layers, indicating that the observed H2CS emitting up to\nradii larger than 100 au is likely injected in the gas due to non-thermal\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 14:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

Due\nto the large computational complexity of deformable registration of volumetric\nimages, conventional iterative methods usually face the tradeoff between the\nregistration accuracy and the computation time in practice. In order to boost\nthe registration performance in both accuracy and runtime, we propose a fast\nconvolutional neural network. Specially, to efficiently utilize the memory\nresources and enlarge the model capacity, we adopt additive forwarding instead\nof channel concatenation and deepen the network in each encoder and decoder\nstage. To facilitate the learning efficiency, we leverage skip connection\nwithin the encoder and decoder stages to enable residual learning and employ an\nauxiliary loss at the bottom layer with lowest resolution to involve deep\nsupervision. Particularly, the low-resolution auxiliary loss is weighted by an\nexponentially decayed parameter during the training phase. In conjunction with\nthe main loss in high-resolution grid, a coarse-to-fine learning strategy is\nachieved. Last but not least, we introduce an auxiliary loss based on the\nsegmentation prior to improve the registration performance in Dice score.\nComparing to the auxiliary loss using average Dice score, the proposed\nmulti-label segmentation loss does not induce additional memory cost in the\ntraining phase and can be employed on images with arbitrary amount of\ncategories. In the experiments, we show FDRN outperforms the existing\nstate-of-the-art registration methods for brain MR images by resorting to the\ncompact network structure and efficient learning.

Our system, deployed to a\nleader server in DL clusters, will dispatch users' benchmark jobs to follower\nworkers. Next, the corresponding requests, workload, and even models can be\ngenerated automatically by the system to conduct DL serving benchmarks.\nFinally, developers can leverage many analysis tools and models in our system\nto gain insights into the trade-offs of different system configurations. In\naddition, a two-tier scheduler is incorporated to avoid unnecessary\ninterference and improve average job compilation time by up to 1.43x\n(equivalent of 30\\% reduction). Our system design follows the best practice in\nDL clusters operations to expedite day-to-day DL service evaluation efforts by\nthe developers. We conduct many benchmark experiments to provide in-depth and\ncomprehensive evaluations. We believe these results are of great values as\nguidelines for DL service configuration and resource allocation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 14:56:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 03:21:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 05:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

Here, a new\napplication of non-adiabatic quantum dynamics to cosmological models is shown\nto lead to a multi-field Higgs-like potential, consistent with observations of\na slightly red-tilted power spectrum and a small tensor-to-scalar ratio,\nwithout requiring non-standard ingredients. These methods naturally lead to\nnovel effects in the beginning of inflation, circumventing common fine-tuning\nissues by an application of uncertainty relations to estimate the initial\nquantum fluctuations in the early universe. Moreover, inflation ends smoothly\nas a consequence of the derived multi-field interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 15:34:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-29"}

A prime example is\nfederated learning that exchanges the gradients or weights of each neural\nnetwork model. Under limited communication resources, however, such a method\nbecomes extremely costly particularly for modern deep neural networks having a\nhuge number of model parameters. In this regard, federated distillation (FD) is\na compelling distributed learning solution that only exchanges the model\noutputs whose dimensions are commonly much smaller than the model sizes (e.g.,\n10 labels in the MNIST dataset). The goal of this chapter is to provide a deep\nunderstanding of FD while demonstrating its communication efficiency and\napplicability to a variety of tasks. To this end, towards demystifying the\noperational principle of FD, the first part of this chapter provides a novel\nasymptotic analysis for two foundational algorithms of FD, namely knowledge\ndistillation (KD) and co-distillation (CD), by exploiting the theory of neural\ntangent kernel (NTK).

We found that the DR-Unet104 achieved a mean dice\nscore coefficient of 0.8862, 0.6756 and 0.6721 for validation data, whole\ntumor, enhancing tumor and tumor core respectively, an overall improvement on\n0.8770, 0.65242 and 0.68134 achieved by DeepLabV3+. Our method produced a final\nmean DSC of 0.8673, 0.7514 and 0.7983 on whole tumor, enhancing tumor and tumor\ncore on the challenge's testing data. We produced a competitive lesion\nsegmentation architecture, despite only 2D convolutions, having the added\nbenefit that it can be used on lower power computers than a 3D architecture.\nThe source code and trained model for this work is openly available at\nhttps://github.com/jordan-colman/DR-Unet104.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 01:24:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 14:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Time is an ordering structure among observables.\nUnderstanding the probabilistic laws enables humans to make predictions for\nfuture events. Also space, spacetime and geometry emerge as structures among\nobservables.\n  Within the classical statistical system the time structure induces the\nconcepts of wave functions, density matrices, non-commuting operators and many\nother aspects of quantum physics.

The inductive bias is encoded by hyperparameters that\ndetermine aspects of the model class or training algorithm, such as\ninitialization or learning rate. Meta-learning assumes that the learning tasks\nbelong to a task environment, and that tasks are drawn from the same task\nenvironment both during meta-training and meta-testing. This, however, may not\nhold true in practice. In this paper, we introduce the problem of transfer\nmeta-learning, in which tasks are drawn from a target task environment during\nmeta-testing that may differ from the source task environment observed during\nmeta-training. Novel information-theoretic upper bounds are obtained on the\ntransfer meta-generalization gap, which measures the difference between the\nmeta-training loss, available at the meta-learner, and the average loss on\nmeta-test data from a new, randomly selected, task in the target task\nenvironment. The first bound, on the average transfer meta-generalization gap,\ncaptures the meta-environment shift between source and target task environments\nvia the KL divergence between source and target data distributions. The second,\nPAC-Bayesian bound, and the third, single-draw bound, account for this shift\nvia the log-likelihood ratio between source and target task distributions.\nFurthermore, two transfer meta-learning solutions are introduced. For the\nfirst, termed Empirical Meta-Risk Minimization (EMRM), we derive bounds on the\naverage optimality gap. The second, referred to as Information Meta-Risk\nMinimization (IMRM), is obtained by minimizing the PAC-Bayesian bound.

There exist different versions of this quantity\nfor deterministic and uncertain systems, which are equivalent in the\ndeterministic case. In this work, we present algorithms for the numerical\ncomputation of these two quantities. In particular, given a subset $Q$ of the\nstate set, we first partition it. Then a controller, in the form of a lookup\ntable that assigns a set of control values to each cell of the partition, is\ncomputed to enforce invariance of $Q$. After determinizing the controller, a\nweighted directed graph is constructed. For deterministic systems, the\nlogarithm of the spectral radius of a transition matrix obtained from the graph\ngives an upper bound of the entropy. For uncertain systems, the maximum mean\ncycle weight of the graph upper bounds the entropy. With three deterministic\nexamples, for which the exact value of the invariance entropy is known or can\nbe estimated by other means, we demonstrate that the upper bound obtained by\nour algorithm is of the same order of magnitude as the actual value.\nAdditionally, our algorithm provides a static coder-controller scheme\ncorresponding to the obtained data-rate bound.

The idea is that, whenever communication occurs\nto convey meaning or to accomplish a goal, what really matters is the impact\nthat the correct reception/interpretation of a packet is going to have on the\ngoal accomplishment. Focusing on semantic and goal-oriented aspects, and\npossibly combining them, helps to identify the relevant information, i.e. the\ninformation strictly necessary to recover the meaning intended by the\ntransmitter or to accomplish a goal.
