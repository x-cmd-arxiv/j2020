The observations in the\nchromospheric Ca II lines exhibit intense brightening near the flare\nfootpoints. At these locations, a non-LTE inversion code was employed to infer\nthe temperature, magnetic field, line-of-sight (LOS) velocity and\nmicroturbulent velocity stratification in the flaring atmosphere. During the\nflare peak time, the LOS velocity shows both upflows and downflows around the\nflare footpoints in the upper chromosphere and lower chromosphere,\nrespectively. Moreover, the temporal analysis of the LOS magnetic field at the\nflarepoints exhibits a maximum change of ~600 G. After the flare, the LOS\nmagnetic field decreases to the non-flaring value, exhibiting no permanent or\nstep-wise change. The analysis of response functions to the temperature, LOS\nmagnetic field and velocity shows that the Ca II lines exhibit enhanced\nsensitivity to the deeper layers (i.e., log_t ~ -3) of the flaring atmosphere,\nwhereas for the non-flaring atmosphere they are mainly sensitive around log_t ~\n-4. We suggest that a fraction of the apparent increase in the LOS magnetic\nfield at the flare footpoints may be due to the increase in the sensitivity of\nthe Ca II 8542 \\AA line in the deeper layers, where the field strength is\nrelatively stronger. The rest can be due to magnetic field reconfiguration\nduring the flare. Our observations illustrate that even a less intense C-class\nflare can heat the deeper layers of the solar chromosphere, mainly at the flare\nfootpoints, without affecting the photosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 16:30:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 15:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Rather than an orbital ordered phase reaching up to high temperatures\nof approximately 800-1100 K, we propose a loss of spontaneous orbital order\nalready near room temperature. Above this temperature, the phase is\ncharacterized by a finite orbital polarization and octahedral tilt pattern. The\ntilt pattern couples to the Jahn-Teller distortion and thus induces a remaining\norbital order, which persists up to high temperatures, where the tilt order is\nlost as well. This explains the experimental observation of orbital order up to\nhigh temperatures. The reevaluation of the orbital order transition is based on\nobserved anomalies of various physical properties at a temperatures of 220-260\nK in epitaxial thin films of $Pr_{1-x}Ca_xMnO_3$ x=0.1, i.e.in the photovoltaic\neffect, electric transport, magnetization, optical and ultrafast transient pump\nprobe studies.

This is similar to the gradient calculation\nsubroutine dominating the simulation of quantum gradient descent, which has\nattracted HPC strategies and bespoke simulation algorithms with asymptotic\nspeedups. We here present a novel simulation strategy to precisely calculate\nthe quantum natural gradient in O(P^2) gates and O(1) state-vectors.

It is furthermore compatible with parallelisation\nschemes, like hardware acceleration and distribution. Since our scheme\nleverages a form of the Fisher information matrix for strictly unitary ansatz\ncircuits, it cannot be simply extended to density matrix simulation of quantum\nnatural gradient with non-unitary circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 17:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-06"}

Numerical methods typically\nemploy a uniform mesh fine enough to resolve the highest harmonic present in\nthe problem, leading to a very large number of degrees of freedom. This paper\nproposes a more efficient strategy in which each harmonic is approximated on a\nseparate mesh, the size of which is proportional to the wavelength of the\nharmonic. The increase in resolution required to resolve a smaller wavelength\nis balanced by a reduction in the domain size. This nested meshing is feasible\nowing to the increasingly localised nature of higher harmonics near the focus.\n  Numerical experiments are performed for FUS transducers in homogeneous media\nin order to determine the size of the meshes required to accurately represent\nthe harmonics. In particular, a fast \\emph{volume potential} approach is\nproposed and employed to perform convergence experiments as the computation\ndomain size is modified. This approach allows each harmonic to be computed via\nthe evaluation of an integral over the domain. Discretising this integral using\nthe midpoint rule allows the computations to be performed rapidly with the FFT.\nIt is shown that at least an order of magnitude reduction in memory consumption\nand computation time can be achieved with nested meshing.

Common augmentation strategies work by drawing\nrandom samples from a space of transformations. Unfortunately, such sampling\napproaches are limited in expressivity, as they are unable to scale to rich\ntransformations that depend on numerous parameters due to the curse of\ndimensionality. Adversarial examples can be considered as an alternative scheme\nfor data augmentation. By being trained on the most difficult modifications of\nthe inputs, the resulting models are then hopefully able to handle other,\npresumably easier, modifications as well. The advantage of adversarial\naugmentation is that it replaces sampling with the use of a single, calculated\nperturbation that maximally increases the loss. The downside, however, is that\nthese raw adversarial perturbations appear rather unstructured; applying them\noften does not produce a natural transformation, contrary to a desirable data\naugmentation technique. To address this, we propose a method to generate\nadversarial examples that maintain some desired natural structure. We first\nconstruct a subspace that only contains perturbations with the desired\nstructure. We then project the raw adversarial gradient onto this space to\nselect a structured transformation that would maximally increase the loss when\napplied. We demonstrate this approach through two types of image\ntransformations: photometric and geometric. Furthermore, we show that training\non such structured adversarial images improves generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 18:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-06"}

We study here the CFS effect in the presence of\nquantum multifractality, a fundamental property of several systems, such as the\nAnderson model at the metal-insulator transition. We focus on Floquet systems,\nand find that the CFS peak shape and its peak height dynamics are generically\ncontrolled by the multifractal dimensions $D_1$ and $D_2$, and by the spectral\nform factor. We check our results using a 1D Floquet system whose states have\nmultifractal properties controlled by a single parameter.

The degree to which this happens depends on the position along a\nvoice-leading continuum, ranging from monophonic, to homophonic, to polyphonic,\nwhich complicates the design of automatic voice separation models. We address\nthis continuum by defining voice separation as the task of decomposing music\ninto streams that exhibit both a high degree of external perceptual separation\nfrom the other streams and a high degree of internal perceptual consistency.\nThe proposed voice separation task allows for a voice to diverge to multiple\nvoices and also for multiple voices to converge to the same voice. Equipped\nwith this flexible task definition, we manually annotated a corpus of popular\nmusic and used it to train neural networks that assign notes to voices either\nseparately for each note in a chord (note-level), or jointly to all notes in a\nchord (chord-level). The trained neural models greedily assign notes to voices\nin a left to right traversal of the input chord sequence, using a diverse set\nof perceptually informed input features. When evaluated on the extraction of\nconsecutive within voice note pairs, both models surpass a strong baseline\nbased on an iterative application of an envelope extraction function, with the\nchord-level model consistently edging out the note-level model. The two models\nare also shown to outperform previous approaches on separating the voices in\nBach music.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 18:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-06"}

The\nanswer to these questions, so crucial to astrophysics and cosmology, requires\nthe full reconstruction of the so called cosmic star formation rate density\n(SFRD), i.e. the evolution of the average star formation rate per unit volume\nof the universe. While the SFRD has been reliably traced back to 10-11 billion\nyears ago, its evolution is still poorly constrained at earlier cosmic epochs,\nand its estimate is mainly based on galaxies luminous in the ultraviolet and\nwith low obscuration by dust.

We show that the Ar-RNN-T loss provides a refined control to\nnavigate the trade-offs between the token emission delays and the Word Error\nRate (WER). The Ar-RNN-T models also improve downstream applications such as\nthe ASR End-pointing by guaranteeing token emissions within any given range of\nlatency. Moreover, the Ar-RNN-T loss allows for bigger batch sizes and 4 times\nhigher throughput for our LSTM model architecture, enabling faster training and\nconvergence on GPUs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 19:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

We present a method\nthat learns a simple geometric approximation of random paths in a homogeneous\nvolume of translucent material. The generated representation allows determining\nthe absorption along the path as well as a direct lighting contribution, which\nis representative of all scattering events along the path. A sequence of\nconditional variational auto-encoders (CVAEs) is trained to model the\nstatistical distribution of the photon paths inside a spherical region in\npresence of multiple scattering events. A first CVAE learns to sample the\nnumber of scattering events, occurring on a ray path inside the sphere, which\neffectively determines the probability of the ray being absorbed. Conditioned\non this, a second model predicts the exit position and direction of the light\nparticle. Finally, a third model generates a representative sample of photon\nposition and direction along the path, which is used to approximate the\ncontribution of direct illumination due to in-scattering. To accelerate the\ntracing of the light path through the volumetric medium toward the solid\nboundary, we employ a sphere-tracing strategy that considers the light\nabsorption and is able to perform statistically accurate next-event estimation.\nWe demonstrate efficient learning using shallow networks of only three layers\nand no more than 16 nodes. In combination with a GPU shader that evaluates the\nCVAEs' predictions, performance gains can be demonstrated for a variety of\ndifferent scenarios. A quality evaluation analyzes the approximation error that\nis introduced by the data-driven scattering simulation and sheds light on the\nmajor sources of error in the accelerated path tracing process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 20:15:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-09"}

The tunability of the energy contribution of direct and indirect\nmagnetoexcitons by electric and magnetic fields is demonstrated.

The run-out mechanism in a submarine\nlandslide is affected by factors such as the initial packing density,\npermeability, slope angle, and initial volume. While past studies have focused\non the influence of density, permeability, and slope angle on the granular\ncolumn collapse, the impact of volume on the run-out characteristics has not\nbeen investigated. This study aims to understand how the initial volume affects\nthe run-out using a two-dimensional coupled lattice Boltzman and discrete\nelement (LBM-DEM) method. The coupled LBM-DEM approach allows simulating fluid\nflow at the pore-scale resolution to understand the grain-scale mechanisms\ndriving the complex continuum-scale response in the granular column collapse.\nFor submerged granular column collapse, the run-out mechanism is heavily\ninfluenced by the interaction between the grains and the surrounding fluid. The\ndevelopment of negative pore pressures during shearing and hydrodynamic drag\nforces inhibit the flow. On the other hand, entrainment of water resulting in\nhydroplaning enhances the flow. With an increase in volume, the interaction\nbetween the grains and the surrounding fluid varies, causing changes in the\nrun-out behavior. For smaller volumes, the forces inhibiting the underwater\nflow predominates, resulting in shorter run-outs than their dry counterparts.\nAt large volumes, hydroplaning results in larger run-out than the dry cases,\ndespite the inhibiting effects of drag forces and negative pore pressures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 22:42:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-09"}

Manual methods that rely on\nphysical tools like rulers are time and labour intensive. Leading automatic\napproaches rely on fully-supervised segmentation models to acquire these\nmeasurements but these require collecting per-pixel labels -- also time\nconsuming and laborious: i.e., it can take up to two minutes per fish to\ngenerate accurate segmentation labels, almost always requiring at least some\nmanual intervention. We propose an automatic segmentation model efficiently\ntrained on images labeled with only point-level supervision, where each fish is\nannotated with a single click. This labeling process requires significantly\nless manual intervention, averaging roughly one second per fish. Our approach\nuses a fully convolutional neural network with one branch that outputs\nper-pixel scores and another that outputs an affinity matrix. We aggregate\nthese two outputs using a random walk to obtain the final, refined per-pixel\nsegmentation output. We train the entire model end-to-end with an LCFCN loss,\nresulting in our A-LCFCN method. We validate our model on the DeepFish dataset,\nwhich contains many fish habitats from the north-eastern Australian region. Our\nexperimental results confirm that A-LCFCN outperforms a fully-supervised\nsegmentation model at fixed annotation budget.

For\nideally conductive particles, the dynamics of the suspension are primarily\ncontrolled by induced-charge electrophoresis. To characterize the rheological\nproperties of the suspension, the particle stress tensor and particle pressure\nare calculated in a range of volume fraction up to almost random close packing.\nThe particle normal stress and particle pressure are shown to behave\nnon-monotonically with volume fraction, especially in concentrated regimes. In\nparticular, the particle pressure is positive for volume fraction up to 30\\%,\nafter which it becomes negative, indicating a change in the nature of the\nparticle pressure. The microstructure expressed by pair distribution function\nand suspension entropy is also evaluated. Visible variations in the local\nmicrostructure seem to correlate with the non-monotonic variation in the\nparticle normal stresses and particle pressure.

However, ReLU contains several shortcomings that can result in\ninefficient training of the deep neural networks, these are: 1) the negative\ncancellation property of ReLU tends to treat negative inputs as unimportant\ninformation for the learning, resulting in a performance degradation; 2) the\ninherent predefined nature of ReLU is unlikely to promote additional\nflexibility, expressivity, and robustness to the networks; 3) the mean\nactivation of ReLU is highly positive and leads to bias shift effect in network\nlayers; and 4) the multilinear structure of ReLU restricts the non-linear\napproximation power of the networks. To tackle these shortcomings, this paper\nintroduced Parametric Flatten-T Swish (PFTS) as an alternative to ReLU.

Using the example of Al-Al2O3-Al, we show that there\nare two main contributions, namely the cold field emission effect and the\nhopping conductivity through the dielectric. Our main finding is that an\napplication of a high electric field, ~0.6-0.7 GV/m, causes electrons to\npenetrate the dielectric. If the temperature is sufficiently low, such\nelectrons become permanently trapped in the dielectric. To achieve a strong\ncharging of the dielectric, the voltage needs to be high enough, so that a\nfield emission occurs from the cathode into the dielectric.

When channels\nare time-varying, the deep neural networks (DNNs) need to be re-trained\nfrequently, which calls for low training complexity. To reduce the number of\ntraining samples and the size of DNN required to achieve good performance, a\npromising approach is to embed the DNNs with priori knowledge. Since cellular\nnetworks can be modelled as a graph, it is natural to employ graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) for learning, which exhibit permutation invariance (PI) and\nequivalence (PE) properties. Unlike the homogeneous GNNs that have been used\nfor wireless problems, whose outputs are invariant or equivalent to arbitrary\npermutations of vertexes, heterogeneous GNNs (HetGNNs), which are more\nappropriate to model cellular networks, are only invariant or equivalent to\nsome permutations. If the PI or PE properties of the HetGNN do not match the\nproperty of the task to be learned, the performance degrades dramatically. In\nthis paper, we show that the power control policy has a combination of\ndifferent PI and PE properties, and existing HetGNN does not satisfy these\nproperties.

In this paper, we combine some aspects\nof classic techniques for data-association filtering with modern\nattention-based neural networks to construct object-based memory systems that\noperate on high-dimensional observations and hypotheses. We perform end-to-end\nlearning on labeled observation trajectories to learn both the transition and\nobservation models. We demonstrate the system's effectiveness in maintaining\nmemory of dynamically changing objects in both simulated environment and real\nimages, and demonstrate improvements over classical structured approaches as\nwell as unstructured neural approaches.

Moreover, the detonation speed\nis considerably influenced by the droplet pre-vaporization and diameter. The\nvelocity deficits vary between 5% and 30%.

Then, we propose a secrecy sum rate optimization\nscheme utilizing the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), which is\nformulated as a non-convex optimization problem. Based on the differential\nstructure of the non-convex constraints, the original problem is approximated\nand solved by a series of convex optimization problems. Simulation results\nvalidate the analytical results and the effectiveness of the secrecy sum rate\noptimization algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 05:49:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-09"}

In\nour approach, we have leveraged the use of local deep convolutional neural\nnetworks which combines the powers of both the features of lower and higher\nlayers for creating feature maps which are then compressed using PCA and fed to\na bloom filter after binary sequencing using a modified multi k-means approach.\nThe feature maps obtained are further used in the image retrieval process in a\nhierarchical coarse-to-fine manner by first comparing the images in the higher\nlayers for semantically similar images and then gradually moving towards the\nlower layers searching for structural similarities. While searching, the neural\nhashes for the query image are again calculated and queried in the bloom filter\nwhich tells us whether the query image is absent in the set or maybe present.\nIf the bloom filter doesn't necessarily rule out the query, then it goes into\nthe image retrieval process.

As a result\nof this, we show how this additional nonlinearity, in the newly introduced\nparameters, can bring a significant shift in the peak time of infection, i.e.,\nthe time at which the infected population reaches maximum. We show that in\nspecial cases, even we can get a transition from epidemic to a non-epidemic\nstage of a particular infectious disease. We further study one such special\ncase and treat it as a problem of phase transition.

Therefore, managing peak\npower consumption has become imperative in multi-core MC systems. In this\nregard, we propose an online peak power and thermal management heuristic for\nmulti-core MC systems. This heuristic reduces the peak power consumption of the\nsystem as much as possible during runtime by exploiting dynamic slack and\nper-cluster Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). Specifically, our\napproach examines multiple tasks ahead to determine the most appropriate one\nfor slack assignment, that has the most impact on the system peak power and\ntemperature. However, changing the frequency and selecting a proper task for\nslack assignment and a proper core for task re-mapping at runtime can be\ntime-consuming and may cause deadline violation which is not admissible for\nhigh-criticality tasks. Therefore, we analyze and then optimize our run-time\nscheduler and evaluate it for various platforms. The proposed approach is\nexperimentally validated on the ODROID-XU3 (DVFS-enabled heterogeneous\nmulti-core platform) with various embedded real-time benchmarks.

The scenario that invokes the inverse\nCompton scattering of the CMB by electrons is challenged by the lack of\ngamma-ray emission in the GeV band. An alternative assumes synchrotron emission\nby a distinct population of ultra-high energy electrons. Here we present a\nconcrete attempt to apply this scenario, exploring the specific model in which\nthe ultra-high energy electrons are accelerated in a shear layer surrounding\nthe jet. We limit the study to non-relativistic flows and particle acceleration\nis treated by a Fokker-Planck equation. The observed relation between low\nenergy (radio, optical) and X-ray emission prompts us to assume that the\nrequired population of pre-accelerated particles is provided by a shock\nresponsible for the acceleration of the electrons emitting at low frequencies.\nWe apply the model to the emission of the principal knots of the jets of PKS\n0637-752 and PKS 1136-135, two of the best studied objects.

In\ncontrast, here we discuss a setup where dissipative interactions do amplify a\nphotonic Josephson current, opening a doorway to dissipation-enhanced\nsensitivity of quantum-optical interferometry devices. In particular, we study\ntwo coupled nanolasers subjected to phase coherent drivings and coupled by a\ncoherent photon tunneling process. We describe this system by means of a\nFokker-Planck equation and show that it exhibits an interesting non-equilibrium\nphase diagram as a function of the coherent coupling between nanolasers. As we\nincrease that coupling, we find a non-equilibrium phase transition between a\nphase-locked and a non-phase-locked steady-state, in which phase coherence is\ndestroyed by the photon tunneling process. In the coherent, phase-locked\nregime, an imbalanced photon number population appears if there is a phase\ndifference between the nanolasers, which appears in the steady-state as a\nresult of the competition between competing local dissipative dynamics and the\nJosephson photo-current. The latter is amplified for large incoherent pumping\nrates and it is also enchanced close to the lasing phase transition. We show\nthat the Josephson photocurrent can be used to measure optical phase\ndifferences.

A multitude of experimental observations suggest that chemical\nproperties can be fundamentally altered and novel physical states appear when\nmatter is strongly coupled to resonant cavity modes, i.e. when hybrid\nlight-matter states emerge. Up until now, theoretical approaches to explain and\npredict these observations were either limited to phenomenological quantum\noptical models, suited to describe collective polaritonic effects, or\nalternatively to ab initio approaches for small system sizes. The later methods\nwere particularly controversial since collective effects could not be\nexplicitly included due to the intrinsically low particle numbers, which are\ncomputationally accessible. Here, we demonstrate for a nitrogen dimer chain of\nvariable size that any impurity present in a collectively coupled chemical\nensemble (e.g. temperature fluctuations or reaction process) induces local\nmodifications in the polaritonic system. From this we deduce that a novel dark\nstate is formed, whose local chemical properties are modified considerably at\nthe impurity due to the collectively coupled environment.

The different DG\ndiscretizations are then blended according to sub-element troubled cell\nindicators, resulting in a final discretization that adaptively blends from low\nto high order within a single DG element. The goal is to retain as much high\norder accuracy as possible, even in simulations with very strong shocks, as\ne.g. presented in the Sedov test.

In this paper, we discuss a couple of problems which are typically\nused in basic physics courses, in order to highlight some aspects related to\nRBP motion which are not usually well understood by physics students. The first\nproblem is a pendulum composed of a rod and disk. The angular frequency of the\npendulum is calculated in two situations: disk fixed to the rod and disk free\nto spin. A detailed explanation of the change in the angular frequency from one\ncase to another is given. The second problem is a ladder which slides touching\na frictionless surface. We use this problem to highlight the fact that the\ncontact forces applied by the surface perform translational and rotational work\ndespite that the total mechanical energy of the ladder is conserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 13:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-19"}

The\nmethod is developed for a novel single-detector Compton camera, developed by\nthe authors. The detector is extremely small and weighs only 40 g, which opens\nthe possibility for use on sub-1 kg class of drones. The Compton camera uses\nthe MiniPIX TPX3 CdTe event camera to measure Compton scattering products of\nincoming high-energy gamma photons. The 3D position and the sub-nanosecond time\ndelay of the measured scattering products are used to reconstruct sets of\npossible directions to the source. The proposed method utilizes a filter for\nfusing the measurements and estimating the radiation source position during the\nflight. The computations are executed in real-time onboard and allow\nintegration of the detector info into a fully-autonomous system. Moreover, the\nreal-time nature of the estimator potentially allows estimating states of a\nmoving radiation source. The proposed method was validated in simulations and\ndemonstrated in a real-world experiment with a Cs137 radiation source. The\napproach can localize a gamma source without estimating the gradient or\ncontours of radiation intensity, which opens possibilities for localizing\nsources in a cluttered and urban environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 13:43:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 08:24:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

In this paper, we present a\nframework for concurrent model synchronization algorithms based on Triple Graph\nGrammars (TGGs).

Using TGGs, we infer a causal dependency relation for\nmodel elements that enables us to detect conflicts non-invasively.

However, the variable\nstate combination explosion in some cases is still a problem that may result in\ninefficiency or even disability in DUCG inference. In the situation of clinical\ndiagnoses, when a lot of intermediate causes are unknown while the downstream\nresults are known in a DUCG graph, the combination explosion may appear during\nthe inference computation. Monte Carlo sampling is a typical algorithm to solve\nthis problem.

Different from previous methods that transfer\nknowledge in two stages, the DIM achieves a more efficient one-stage knowledge\ntransfer by mapping images in labeled and unlabeled datasets to a shared\nfeature space. GLO is designed to train the ReID model with unsupervised\nsetting on the target domain. Instead of relying on existing optimization\nstrategies designed for supervised training, GLO involves more images in\ndistance optimization, and achieves better robustness to noisy label\nprediction. GLO also integrates distance optimizations in both the global\ndataset and local training batch, thus exhibits better training efficiency.\nExtensive experiments on three large-scale datasets, i.e., Market-1501,\nDukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17, show that our coupling optimization outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

Optical fibers with chiral microstructures, drawn from a spinning\npreform, have many useful properties, exhibiting for example circular\nbirefringence and circular dichroism. It has recently been shown that chiral\nfibers with N fold rotationally symmetric (symmetry group CN) transverse\nmicrostructures support families of helical Bloch modes (HBMs), each of which\nconsists of a superposition of azimuthal Bloch harmonics (or optical vortices).\nAn example is a fiber with N coupled cores arranged in a ring around its\ncentral axis (N core single ring fiber). Although this type of fiber can be\nreadily modelled using scalar coupled mode theory, a full description of its\noptical properties requires a vectorial analysis that takes account of the\npolarization state of the light particularly important in studies of circular\nand vortical birefringence. In this paper we develop, using an orthogonal two\ndimensional helicoidal coordinate system embedded in a cylindrical surface at\nconstant radius, a rigorous vector coupled mode description of the fields using\nlocal Frenet Serret frames that rotate and twist with each of the N cores.

It is important for policymakers to\nknow how the disease will spread and what are the effects of the policies and\nenvironment on the spreading. In this paper, we propose two extensions to the\nstandard SIR model: (a) we consider the prevention measures adopted based on\nthe current severity of the infection. Those measures are adaptive and change\nover time; (b) multiple cities and regions are considered, with population\nmovements between those cities and regions, while taking into account that each\nregion may have different prevention measures. Although the adaptive measures\nand mobility of the population were often observed during the pandemic, these\neffects are rarely explicitly modeled and studied in the classical epidemic\nmodels. The model we propose gives rise to a plateau phenomenon: the number of\npeople infected by the disease stays at the same level during an extended\nperiod of time. We show what are conditions need to be met in order for the\nspreading to exhibit a plateau period in a single city. In addition, this\nphenomenon is interdependent when considering multiple cities. We verify from\nthe real-world data that the plateau phenomenon does exist in many regions of\nthe world in the current COVID-19 development. Finally, we provide theoretical\nanalysis on the plateau phenomenon for the single-city model and derive a\nseries of results on the emergence and the ending of the plateau, as well as on\nthe height and length of the plateau.

Methods. We used a laser frequency\ncomb (LFC) with unresolved and unblended lines to probe the instrument line\nprofile.

The authors concluded that\nHurricane Katrina improved the eight-year survival rate of elderly and disabled\nresidents of New Orleans by 3% and that most of this decline in mortality was\ndue to declines in mortality among those who moved to places with lower\nmortality. In this article, I provide a critical assessment of the evidence\nprovided by DM to support their conclusions. There are three main problems.\nFirst, DM generally fail to account for the fact that people of different ages,\nraces or sex will have different probabilities of dying as time goes by, and\nwhen they do allow for this, results change markedly. Second, DM do not account\nfor the fact that residents in New Orleans are likely to be selected\nnon-randomly on the basis of health because of the relatively high mortality\nrate in New Orleans compared to the rest of the country.

Social distancing\nand face masks are widely recommended around the globe in order to protect\nothers and prevent the spread of the virus through breathing, coughing, and\nsneezing. To expand the scientific underpinnings of such recommendations, we\ncarry out high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of\nunprecedented resolution and realism to elucidate the underlying physics of\nsaliva particulate transport during human cough with and without facial masks.\nOur simulations: (a) are carried out under both a stagnant ambient flow\n(indoor) and a mild unidirectional breeze (outdoor); (b) incorporate the effect\nof human anatomy on the flow; (c) account for both medical and non-medical\ngrade masks; and (d) consider a wide spectrum of particulate sizes, ranging\nfrom 10 micro m to 300 micro m. We show that during indoor coughing some saliva\nparticulates could travel up to 0.48 m, 0.73 m, and 2.62 m for the cases with\nmedical-grade, non-medical grade, and without facial masks, respectively. Thus,\nin indoor environments either medical or non-medical grade facial masks can\nsuccessfully limit the spreading of saliva particulates to others. Under\noutdoor conditions with a unidirectional mild breeze, however, leakage flow\nthrough the mask can cause saliva particulates to be entrained into the\nenergetic shear layers around the body and transported very fast at large\ndistances by the turbulent flow, thus, limiting the effectiveness of facial\nmasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 14:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-09"}

The site energies and electronic\ncouplings are calculated by using a continuous polarizable model that allow for\nthe analysis of different solvent environments, and the site-to-site couplings\nare computed by means of the generalized Mulliken Hush method at the DFT level.\nWe find that the stabilization energy of the charge transfer states exhibit a\nsignificant variation for a compound embedded in different polar environments,\nand thus the effect due to the solvent has been analyzed for the specific cases\nof Methanol, THF and Toluene.

Comparison to interesting reference cases, such as\nconventional polydisperse suspensions with a frozen parent distribution, or\nconventional monodisperse systems interacting with an effective pair potential\nfor one fixed size, shows a significant spread in the structure and dynamics.\nThe differences, most apparent in the high density regimes, are due to\nmany-body correlations and the dynamical coupling between property and\ntranslation in RC systems, not explicitly accounted for in the conventional\ntreatments. In particular, the translational diffusion in the RC systems is\nsurprisingly close to the free (single RC) diffusion, mainly due to a\ncancellation of crowding and size compression effects.

The choice of thermal boundary conditions in such models is\nnot always straightforward. To understand the implications of this choice, we\nreport on the effects of the thermal boundary condition on thermal convection,\nin terms of instability onset, fully developed transport properties and flow\nstructure. We use the Boussinesq approximation, and impose a Robin boundary\ncondition at the top. This enforces the temperature anomaly and its radial\nderivative to be linearly coupled with a proportionality factor $\\beta$. Using\nthe height H of the fluid layer, we introduce the non-dimensional Biot number\nBi* = $\\beta$H. Varying Bi* allows us to transition from fixed temperature for\nBi* = +$\\infty$, to fixed thermal flux for Bi* = 0. The bottom boundary of the\nshell is kept isothermal. We find that the onset of convection is only affected\nby Bi* in the non-rotating case. Far from onset, considering an effective\nRayleigh number and a generalized Nusselt number, we show that the Nusselt and\nP{\\'e}clet numbers follow standard universal scaling laws, independent of Bi*\nin all cases considered. However, the large-scale flow structure keeps the\nsignature of the boundary condition with more vigorous large scales for smaller\nBi* , even though the global heat transfer and kinetic energy are the same.\nFinally, for all practical purposes, the Robin condition can be safely replaced\nby a fixed flux when Bi* < 0.03 and by a fixed temperature for Bi* > 30.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 15:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

Noticeably, the harmonic\nselection problem is equivalently formulated as a maximum weight clique (MWC)\nproblem in graph theory, and the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm (BKA) is adopted in\nthe GHSA. With the enhanced and optimally selected harmonic components, both\nthe existing maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and weighted MLE (WMLE) are\nincorporated to yield the final ENF estimation results. The proposed framework\nis extensively evaluated using both synthetic signals and our ENF-WHU dataset\nconsisting of $130$ real-world audio recordings, demonstrating substantially\nimproved capability of extracting the ENF from realistically noisy observations\nover the existing single- and multi-tone competitors. This work further\nimproves the applicability of the ENF as a forensic criterion in real-world\nsituations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 15:10:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

As the\nmismatch between the ASN used for learning the localization model and the one\nafter a node displacement leads to erroneous position estimates, a displacement\nhas to be detected and the displaced nodes need to be identified. We propose a\nmethod that considers the disparity in position estimates made by\nleave-one-node-out (LONO) sub-networks and uses a Markov random field (MRF)\nframework to infer the probability of each LONO position estimate being\naligned, misaligned or unreliable while accounting for the noise inherent to\nthe estimator. This probabilistic approach is advantageous over naive detection\nmethods, as it outputs a normalized value that encapsulates conditional\ninformation provided by each LONO sub-network on whether the reading is in\nmisalignment with the overall network. Experimental results confirm that the\nperformance of the proposed method is consistent in identifying compromised\nnodes in various acoustic conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 15:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-09"}

Previous dynamical modeling showed that the\ngalaxy is approaching the cluster center and is therefore undergoing increasing\nram pressure stripping. Recent stellar population fitting of deep optical\nspectra together with multiband photometry lead to the determination of the\ntime when star formation was quenched in the galactic disk.

The results of 50\nsimulations with five different Lorentzian temporal ram-pressure profiles and\nfive different delays between the simulation onset and peak ram pressure are\npresented. The inclusion of diffuse gas stripping changes significantly the HI,\nUV, and H$\\alpha$ emission distributions. The simulations with diffuse gas\nstripping naturally lead to vertical low surface density filaments in the\ndownwind region of the galactic disk. These filaments occur less frequently in\nthe simulations without diffuse gas stripping. The simulations with diffuse gas\nstripping lead to better joint fits to the SEDs and optical spectra.

While existing research uses\ninformation retrieval (IR) and/or combination of machine learning (ML) or deep\nlearning (DL) approaches, they focus primarily on benchmark Java projects, and\nalso motivate the need for multi-language bug localization approach. Objective:\nTo create a novel bug localization approach that leverages the syntactic\nstructure of source code, bug report information and which can support\nmulti-language projects along with a new dataset of C projects. Method: The\nproposed DRAST approach represents source code as code vectors by using its\nhigh-level AST and combines rVSM, an IR technique with ML/DL models such as\nRandom Forest and Deep Neural Network regressor to rank the list of buggy\nfiles. We also use features such as textual similarity using IR techniques,\nlexical mismatch using DNNs, and history of the project using the metadata of\nBugC dataset. Results: We tested DRAST on seven projects from the BugC dataset,\nwhich consists of 2462 bug reports from 21 open-source C projects.

Half-Heuslers\nare good candidates for band convergence studies because they have multiple\nbands near the valence bad edge that can be converged through various band\nengineering approaches providing power factor improvement opportunities.\nTheoretical calculations to identify the outcome of band convergence employ\nvarious approximations for the carrier scattering relaxation times (the most\ncommon being the constant relaxation time approximation) due to the high\ncomputational complexity involved in extracting them accurately. Here, we\ncompare the outcome of strain-induced band convergence under two such\nscattering scenarios: i) the most commonly used constant relaxation time\napproximation and ii) energy dependent inter- and intra-valley scattering\nconsiderations for the half-Heuslers NbCoSn and TiCoSb. We show that the\noutcome of band convergence on the power factor depends on the carrier\nscattering assumptions, as well as the temperature. For both materials\nexamined, band convergence improves the power factor. For NbCoSn, however, band\nconvergence becomes more beneficial as temperature increases, under both\nscattering relaxation time assumptions. In the case of TiCoSb, on the other\nhand, constant relaxation time considerations also indicate that the relative\npower factor improvement increases with temperature, but under the energy\ndependent scattering time considerations, the relative improvement weakens with\ntemperature. This indicates that the scattering details need to be accurately\nconsidered in band convergence studies to predict more accurate trends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 15:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

Here we consider\nhomeostasis as a phenomenon of network dynamics. In this context, we improve a\ngeneral theory for the analysis of homeostasis in network dynamical systems\nwith distinguished input and output nodes, called `input-output networks'. The\ntheory allows one to define `homeostasis types' of a given network in a `model\nindependent' fashion, in the sense that the classification depends on the\nnetwork topology rather than on the specific model equations. Each `homeostasis\ntype' represents a possible mechanism for generating homeostasis and is\nassociated with a suitable `subnetwork motif' of the original network. Our\ncontribution is an extension of the theory to the case of networks with\nmultiple input nodes. To showcase our theory, we apply it to bacterial\nchemotaxis, a paradigm for homeostasis in biochemical systems. By considering a\nrepresentative model of Escherichia coli chemotaxis, we verify that the\ncorresponding abstract network has multiple input nodes. Thus showing that our\nextension of the theory allows for the inclusion of an important class of\nmodels that were previously out of reach. Moreover, from our abstract point of\nview, the occurrence of homeostasis in the studied model is caused by a new\nmechanism, called input counterweight homeostasis. This new homeostasis\nmechanism was discovered in the course of our investigation and is generated by\na balancing between the several input nodes of the network -- therefore, it\nrequires the existence of at least two input nodes to occur. Finally, the\nframework developed here allows one to formalize a notion of `robustness' of\nhomeostasis based on the concept of `genericity' from the theory dynamical\nsystems. We discuss how this kind of robustness of homeostasis appears in the\nchemotaxis model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 21:28:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 17:06:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 17:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

For this reason, substantial research efforts have been\ninvested in the development of effective means of non-invasive diagnosis of AD\nat its earliest possible stages. In pursuit of the same objective, the present\npaper addresses the problem of the quantitative diagnosis of AD by means of\nDiffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI).

This paper describes Amadeus, which balances privacy and utility by\nredacting video in near realtime for smart-city applications. Our main insight\nis that whitelisting objects, or blocking by default, is crucial for scalable,\nprivacy-preserving video analytics. In the context of modern object detectors,\nwe prove that whitelisting reduces the risk of an object-detection error\nleading to a privacy violation, and helps Amadeus scale to a large and diverse\nset of applications. In particular, Amadeus utilizes whitelisting to generate\ncomposable encrypted object-specific live streams, which simultaneously meet\nthe requirements of multiple applications in a privacy-preserving fashion,\nwhile reducing the compute and streaming-bandwidth requirements at the edge.\nExperiments with our Amadeus prototype show that compared to blacklisting\nobjects, whitelisting yields significantly better privacy (up to ~28x) and\nbandwidth savings (up to ~5.5x). Additionally, our experiments also indicate\nthat the composable live streams generated by Amadeus are usable by real-world\napplications with minimum utility loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 05:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

In this paper, we show that Fr\\\"ohlich theory can be\nextended to eliminate this problem. We derive four additional terms in the\nFr\\\"ohlich Hamiltonian to account for anharmonicity up to third order. We\ncalculate the energy and effective mass of the new polaron, using both\nperturbation theory and Feynman's path integral formalism. It is shown that the\nanharmonic terms lead to significant additional trapping of the electron. The\nderived Hamiltonian is well-suited for analytical calculations, due to its\nsimplicity and since the number of model parameters is low. Since it is a\ndirect extension of the Fr\\\"ohlich Hamiltonian, it can readily be used to\ninvestigate the effect of anharmonicity on other polaron properties, such as\nthe optical conductivity and the formation of bipolarons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 15:54:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 16:36:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 16:06:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 15:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

The process of producing electricity is dynamic and rapidly changing\ndue to many factors such as weather and electrical grid requirements. Gas\nturbine equipment are also a dynamic part of the electricity generation since\nthe equipment characteristics and thermodynamics behavior change as the\nturbines age. Regular maintenance of turbines are also another dynamic part of\nthe electrical generation process, affecting the performance of equipment. This\nanalysis discovered using KNN, trained on relatively small dataset produces the\nmost accurate prediction rates. This statement can be logically explained as\nKNN finds the K nearest neighbor to the current input parameters and estimates\na rated average of historically similar observations as prediction.\n  This paper incorporates ambient weather conditions, electrical output as well\nas turbine performance factors to build a machine learning model to predict NOx\nemissions. The model can be used to optimize the operational processes for\nreduction in harmful emissions and increasing overall operational efficiency.\nLatent algorithms such as Principle Component Algorithms (PCA) have been used\nfor monitoring the equipment performance behavior change which deeply\ninfluences process paraments and consequently determines NOx emissions.

In fact, several\nworks have found that these networks systematically fail to recognise new\nobjects on untrained locations. In this work we show how, even though CNNs are\nnot 'architecturally invariant' to translation, they can indeed 'learn' to be\ninvariant to translation. We verified that this can be achieved by pretraining\non ImageNet, and we found that it is also possible with much simpler datasets\nin which the items are fully translated across the input canvas. We\ninvestigated how this pretraining affected the internal network\nrepresentations, finding that the invariance was almost always acquired, even\nthough it was some times disrupted by further training due to catastrophic\nforgetting/interference.
