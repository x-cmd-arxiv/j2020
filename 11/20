This suggests that magnetars\ncan make FRBs. On the other hand, the majority of X-ray bursts from SGR\nJ1935+2154 are not associated with FRBs. One possible reason for such rarity of\nFRB-SGR-burst associations is that the FRB emission is much more narrowly\nbeamed than the SGR burst emission. If such an interpretation is correct, one\nwould expect to detect radio bursts with viewing angles somewhat outside the\nnarrow emission beam. These \"slow\" radio bursts (SRBs) would have broader\nwidths and lower flux densities due to the smaller Doppler factor involved. We\nderive two \"closure relations\" to judge whether a long, less luminous radio\nburst could be an SRB. The 2.2-s, 308 Jy ms, 111 MHz radio burst detected from\nSGR J1935+2154 by the BSA LPI radio telescope may be such an SRB. The 2-ms, 60\nmJy ms faint burst detected by FAST from the same source could be also an SRB\nif the corresponding FRB has a narrow spectrum. If the FRB beam is narrow,\nthere should be many more SRBs than FRBs from Galactic magnetars. The lack of\ndetection of abundant SRBs from magnetars would disfavor the hypothesis that\nall SGR bursts are associated with narrow-beam FRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 16:04:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 05:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

Often, the\nmechanism considered to arrive at such enhanced power involves a modification\nof the standard slow roll inflationary dynamics, achieved with the aid of\nfine-tuned potentials. In this work, we investigate another well known method\nto generate features in the power spectrum wherein the initial state of the\nperturbations is assumed to be squeezed states. This approach is technically\nstraightforward to implement since the Bogoliubov coefficients characterizing\nthe squeezed initial states, can be immediately determined from the desired\nform of the power spectrum. It is known that, for squeezed initial states, the\nscalar bispectrum is strongly scale dependent and the consistency condition\ngoverning the scalar bispectrum in the squeezed limit is violated. In fact, the\nnon-Gaussianity parameter $f_{_{\\rm NL}}$ characterizing the scalar bispectrum\nproves to be inversely proportional to the squeezed mode and this dependence\nenhances its amplitude at large wave numbers making it highly sensitive to even\na small deviation from the standard Bunch-Davies vacuum. These aspects can\npossibly aid in leading to enhanced formation of PBHs and generation of\nsecondary GWs. However, we find that: (i) the desired form of the squeezed\ninitial states may be challenging to achieve from a dynamical mechanism, and\n(ii) the backreaction due to the excited states severely limits the extent of\ndeviation from the Bunch-Davies vacuum at large wave numbers. We argue that,\nunless the issue of backreaction is circumvented, squeezed initial states\ncannot lead to a substantial increase in power on small scales that is required\nfor enhanced formation of PBHs and generation of secondary GWs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 16:20:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

This two-flavor dense quark phase consists of the\ncoexistence of the 2SC condensates and the $P$-wave diquark condensates of\n$d$-quarks, which gives rise to color superconductivity as well as\nsuperfluidity. We classify vortices in this phase. The most stable vortices are\nwhat we call the non-Abelian Alice strings, which are superfluid vortices with\nnon-Abelian color magnetic fluxes therein, exhibiting so-called topological\nobstruction, or a non-Abelian generalization of the Alice property. We show\nthat a single Abelian superfluid vortex is unstable against decay into three\nnon-Abelian Alice strings. We discover that a non-Abelian Alice string carries\norientational moduli of the real projective space $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ corresponding\nto the color flux therein in the presence of the $P$-wave condensates alone. We\ncalculate Aharanov-Bohm (AB) phases around the non-Abelian Alice string, and\nfind that the 2SC condensates and string's orientational moduli must be aligned\nwith each other because of single-valuedness of the AB phases of the 2SC\ncondensates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 16:39:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 03:38:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

The\ndielectric strength of the insulating film limits how much energy can be stored\nin nanocapacitors. The origin of the electric current in the nanometer-scale\ninsulating barrier remains unexplained. Here we present an optically\ntransparent Al-Al2O3-graphene nanocapacitor suitable for studying electronic\ntransport in calibrated nanoscale dielectric films under high electric fields\nand with light exposure. The controllable flow of photons provides an\nadditional powerful probe helping to resolve the puzzle of the electric\nconductivity in these high-quality insulating films.

With this device we\nobserve a photon-assisted field emission effect, in which the effective barrier\nheight is reduced by a quantity equal to the photon energy. Our main finding is\na reversed photoeffect. Namely, at sufficiently high bias voltages the current\nthrough the dielectric film decreases as the light intensity increases.\nMoreover, higher photon energies correlate with stronger decreases of the\ncurrent. To explain this reversed photoeffect, we present a qualitative model\nbased on a conjecture that electrons leak into the dielectric and form charged\nsandpile-like branching patterns, which facilitate transport, and which can be\ndispersed by light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 16:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

Here I consider the observed distribution of\n$^{26}$Al in the Galaxy and typical star-forming environments to estimate the\nlikelihood of $^{26}$Al enrichment during planet formation. I do not assume\nSolar-System-specific constraints as I am interested in enrichment for\nexoplanets generally. Observations indicate that high-mass stars dominate the\nproduction of $^{26}$Al with nearly equal contributions from their winds and\nsupernovae. $^{26}$Al abundances are comparable to those in the early Solar\nSystem in the high-mass star-forming regions where most stars (and thereby most\nplanets) form. These high abundances appear to be maintained for a few Myr,\nmuch longer than the 0.7 Myr half-life. Observed bulk $^{26}$Al velocities are\nan order of magnitude slower than expected from winds and supernovae. These\nobservations are at odds with typical model assumptions that $^{26}$Al is\nprovided instantaneously by high velocity mass loss from supernovae and winds.\nRegular replenishment of $^{26}$Al especially when coupled with the small age\ndifferences that are common in high-mass star-forming complexes, may\nsignificantly increase the number of star/planet-forming systems exposed to\n$^{26}$Al. Exposure does not imply enrichment, but the order of magnitude\nslower velocity of $^{26}$Al may alter the fraction that is incorporated into\nplanet-forming material. Together, this suggests that the conditions for rocky\nplanet formation are not rare, nor are they ubiquitous, as small regions like\nTaurus that lack high-mass stars to produce $^{26}$Al may be less likely to\nform rocky planets. I conclude with suggested directions for future studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 17:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

Hence, a\nrevolutionary change in transport efficiency is urgently needed. One approach\nto tackle this change is to transfer the successful model of the Digital\nInternet for data exchange to the physical transport of goods: The so-called\nPhysical Internet (PI, or $\\pi$). The potential of the Physical Internet lies\nin dynamic routing, which increases the utilization of transport modalities,\nlike trucks and vans, and makes transport more efficient. Previous concept\ntransfers have identified and determined the $\\pi$-nodes as routing entities.\nHere, the problem is that the $\\pi$-nodes have no information about real-time\ndata on transport vacancies. This leads to a great challenge for the\n$\\pi$-nodes with regard to routing, in particular in determining the next best\nappropriate node for onward transport of the freight package. This paper\nevolved the state of research concept as an artifact that considers the\n$\\pi$-nodes as routers in a way that it distributes and replicates real-time\ndata to the $\\pi$-nodes in order to enable more effective routing decisions.\nThis real-time data is provided by vehicles, or so-called $\\pi$-transporters,\non the road.

Robust list-decodable learning focuses on\nthe more challenging regime where only a minority $\\frac 1 k$ fraction of the\ndataset is drawn from the distribution of interest, and no assumptions are made\non the remaining data. We study the fundamental task of list-decodable mean\nestimation in high dimensions. Our main result is a new list-decodable mean\nestimation algorithm for bounded covariance distributions with optimal sample\ncomplexity and error rate, running in nearly-PCA time. Assuming the ground\ntruth distribution on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ has bounded covariance, our algorithm\noutputs a list of $O(k)$ candidate means, one of which is within distance\n$O(\\sqrt{k})$ from the truth. Our algorithm runs in time $\\widetilde{O}(ndk)$\nfor all $k = O(\\sqrt{d}) \\cup \\Omega(d)$, where $n$ is the size of the dataset.\nWe also show that a variant of our algorithm has runtime $\\widetilde{O}(ndk)$\nfor all $k$, at the expense of an $O(\\sqrt{\\log k})$ factor in the recovery\nguarantee. This runtime matches up to logarithmic factors the cost of\nperforming a single $k$-PCA on the data, which is a natural bottleneck of known\nalgorithms for (very) special cases of our problem, such as clustering\nwell-separated mixtures. Prior to our work, the fastest list-decodable mean\nestimation algorithms had runtimes $\\widetilde{O}(n^2 d k^2)$ and\n$\\widetilde{O}(nd k^{\\ge 6})$.\n  Our approach builds on a novel soft downweighting method, $\\mathsf{SIFT}$,\nwhich is arguably the simplest known polynomial-time mean estimation technique\nin the list-decodable learning setting.

We propose a method that only uses a single RGB image,\nthus enabling applications in devices or vehicles that do not have LiDAR\nsensors. By using an RGB image, we can leverage the maturity and success of\nrecent 2D object detectors, by extending a 2D detector with a 3D detection\nhead. In this paper we discuss different approaches and experiments, including\nboth regression and classification methods, for designing this 3D detection\nhead.

To\naddress the critical computational challenges of expensive PDE solution and\nhigh-dimensional uncertainty, we construct surrogates of the constraint\nfunction by Taylor approximation, which relies on efficient computation of the\nderivatives, low rank approximation of the Hessian, and a randomized algorithm\nfor eigenvalue decomposition. To tackle the difficulty of the\nnon-differentiability of the inequality chance constraint, we use a smooth\napproximation of the discontinuous indicator function involved in the chance\nconstraint, and apply a penalty method to transform the inequality constrained\noptimization problem to an unconstrained one. Moreover, we design a\ngradient-based optimization scheme that gradually increases smoothing and\npenalty parameters to achieve convergence, for which we present an efficient\ncomputation of the gradient of the approximate cost functional by the Taylor\napproximation.

We show that near extremality the\nboundary conditions inherited from generalized CSS boundary conditions in three\ndimensions give rise to an effective action exhibiting the same symmetry\nbreaking pattern as the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models. Besides the\nSchwarzian term reflecting the breaking of conformal symmetry, the effective\naction contains an additional term that captures the breaking of the $\\widehat\nu(1)$ Kac-Moody symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 17:57:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 May 2021 04:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

Methods: Using\nthe Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) Hemisphere\nSurvey (VHS) and the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) data, we independently\nidentified the companion 2MASS J0249-0557 c. We obtained low-resolution optical\nspectroscopy of this object using the Optical System for Imaging and\nlow-intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) spectrograph at\nthe Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), and near-infrared spectroscopy using the\nSon of Isaac (SofI) spectrograph on the New Technology Telescope (NTT).\nResults: We classified 2MASS J0249-0557 c with a spectral type of L2.5$\\pm$0.5\nin the optical and L3$\\pm$1 in the near-infrared.

This has rendered many\ntraditional defense mechanisms based on cryptography infeasible for deployment\non such networks. Reputation and anomaly detection systems have been\nimplemented as viable alternatives, but existing implementations still struggle\nwith providing efficient security without a significant impact on energy\nconsumption. To address this trade-off between resource consumption and\nresiliency, we designed TrustSense, a reputation management protocol for\nclustered WSNs. It is a semi-centralized family of algorithms that combine\nperiodic trust updates, spatial correlation, and packet sequence validation at\nthe cluster-heads' hierarchy to relieve the sensor nodes of unnecessary opinion\nqueries and trust evaluation computation. We compared the efficiency of\nTrustSense with legacy reputation systems such as EigenTrust and the results of\nsimulations show a significant improvement in reliability and energy usage\nwhile maintaining an acceptable path length with varying numbers of malicious\nnodes. We believe the approach of combining different techniques from various\nclasses of intrusion detection systems unlocks several possibilities of\nachieving better results by more complex and versatile composition of these\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 18:34:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

Nevertheless,\nrestrictive assumptions and lack of rigorous connection to Maxwell's equations\nlimit the TCMT formulation's generality and robustness. Herein, we present the\nBlack-box Coupled-Mode Theory (BBCMT), a general ab initio CMT framework\ndeveloped from Maxwell's equations and quasinormal mode (QNM) theory to model\nthe electromagnetic interactions of dispersive, lossy, and open resonators.\nBBCMT development is enabled by employing Poynting's and conjugated reciprocity\ntheorems to rigorously normalize QNMs and calculate their expansion\ncoefficients. Our novel QNM analysis approach allows the definition of a\nresonator Hamiltonian matrix to characterize the modes' electromagnetic\ninteractions, energy storage, and absorption. Uniquely, the BBCMT framework can\ncapture a resonator's non-resonant scattering and absorption by treating the\nresonator scattered fields as a perturbation to those of a background\nstructure, which can be flexibly chosen considering the desired\naccuracy-simplicity trade-off. BBCMT modeling complexity can be further\nadjusted by treating user-defined subcomponents of a resonator system as\nblack-boxes described only by their input-output transfer characteristics.\nBeyond the BBCMT formulation, we present two lemmas to reverse-engineer the\nmodeling parameters from calculated or measured far-field spectra. Moreover, we\nintroduce the signal flow graphs from control theory to illustrate, interpret,\nand solve the BBCMT equations. To evince BBCMT's validity and generality, we\ncompare the BBCMT and TCMT predictions for two plasmonic nanoresonator systems\nto finite-difference time-domain simulations and find BBCMT results to be a\nmuch better match.

The current NSCO algorithms have worse stochastic\noracle complexities, by orders of magnitude, than those for simpler stochastic\ncomposite optimization problems (e.g., sum of smooth and nonsmooth functions)\nwithout the nested structure. Moreover, they require all outer-layer functions\nto be smooth, which is not satisfied by some important applications. These\ndiscrepancies prompt us to ask: ``does the nested composition make stochastic\noptimization more difficult in terms of the order of oracle complexity?\" In\nthis paper, we answer the question by developing order-optimal algorithms for\nthe convex NSCO problem constructed from an arbitrary composition of smooth,\nstructured non-smooth and general non-smooth layer functions. When all\nouter-layer functions are smooth, we propose a stochastic sequential dual (SSD)\nmethod to achieve an oracle complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^2)$\n($\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon)$) when the problem is non-strongly (strongly) convex.\nWhen there exists some structured non-smooth or general non-smooth outer-layer\nfunction, we propose a nonsmooth stochastic sequential dual (nSSD) method to\nachieve an oracle complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^2)$.

While the balance equation is subject to kinematic admissibility of\nthe displacement field, the evolution equations for the internal variables are\nsubject to irreversibility conditions, and take the form of variational\ninequalities, which are typically solved in a relaxed or penalized way that can\nlead to deviations of the actual solution.

However, the possibility of an anomalous quantum confinement\neffect (AQCE) exists, where the bandgap trend is reversed. In this work, we\ncomputationally identify materials for which such AQCE occurs. Using density\nfunctional theory (DFT), we compute ~1000 OptB88vdW (semi-local functional),\n~50 HSE06 and ~50 PBE0 (hybrid functional) bandgaps for bulk and their\ncorresponding monolayers in the JARVIS-DFT database. OptB88vdW identifies 65\nAQCE materials, but the hybrid functionals only confirm such finding in 14\ncases. Some of the AQCE systems identified through HSE06 and PBE0 are:\nhydroxides or oxide hydroxide compounds (AlOH2, Mg(OH)2, Mg2H2O3, Ni(OH)2,\nSrH2O3) as well as Sb-halogen-chalcogenide compounds (SbSBr, SbSeI) and\nalkali-chalcogenides (RbLiS and RbLiSe). A detailed electronic structure\nanalysis, based on band-structure and projected density of states, shows AQCE\nis often characterized by lowering of the conduction band in the monolayer and\ncorresponding changes in the pz electronic orbital contribution, with z being\nthe non-periodic direction in the 2D case. We believe our computational results\nwould spur the effort to validate the results experimentally and will have\nimpact on bandgap engineering applications based on low-dimensional materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 22:56:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 04:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Exponential boundary\nlayers are highly stable, and are expected to form on the walls of liquid metal\ncoolant ducts within magnetic confinement fusion reactors. Subcritical\ntransitions were detected only at weakly subcritical Reynolds numbers (at most\n$\\approx 70$% below critical). Furthermore, the likelihood of transition was\nvery sensitive to both the perturbation structure and initial energy. Only the\nquasi-two-dimensional Tollmien-Schlichting wave disturbance, attained by either\nlinear or nonlinear optimisation, was able to initiate the transition process,\nby means of the Orr mechanism. The lower initial energy bound sufficient to\ntrigger transition was found to be independent of the domain length. However,\nlonger domains were able to increase the upper energy bound, via the merging of\nrepetitions of the Tollmien-Schlichting wave. This broadens the range of\ninitial energies able to exhibit transitional behaviour. Although the eventual\nrelaminarization of all turbulent states was observed, this was also greatly\ndelayed in longer domains. The maximum nonlinear gains achieved were orders of\nmagnitude larger than the maximum linear gains (with the same initial\nperturbations), regardless if the initial energy was above or below the lower\nenergy bound. Nonlinearity provided a second stage of energy growth by an\narching of the conventional Tollmien-Schlichting wave structure.

To address these issues, in this paper, we proposed a unified\noptimisation model integrating feature extraction and clustering for spike\nsorting. Interestingly, instead of the widely used combination strategies,\ni.e., performing the principal component analysis (PCA) for spike feature\nextraction and K-means (KM) for clustering in sequence, we unified PCA and KM\ninto one optimisation model, which reduces additional processes with fewer\niteration times. Subsequently, by embedding the K-means++ strategy for\ninitialising and a comparison updating rule in the solving process, the\nproposed model can well handle the noises and/or overlapping interference.\nFinally, taking the best of the clustering validity indices into the proposed\nmodel, we derive an automatic spike sorting method.

In this paper, we propose a\nflight sensor data and beamforming signal based integrated UAV tracking scheme\nto deal with this problem. The proposed scheme provides a compatible integrated\nsystem considering the practical specification of the flight sensor data and\nthe beamforming pilot signal. The UAV position tracking is comprised of two\nsteps: 1) UAV position prediction by the flight sensor data and 2) position\nupdate with the beamforming signal using Gaussian process regression (GPR)\nmethod, which is a nonparametric machine learning. The flight sensor data can\nassist ground station (GS) or UAV nodes in designing the precoding and the\nreceive beamforming matrix with drastically reduced overheads. The beamforming\nsignal can accomplish high beamforming gain to be maintained even when the\nflight sensor data is absent. Therefore, the proposed scheme can support the\nmoving target continuously by utilizing these two signals. The simulation\nresults are provided to confirm that the proposed scheme outperforms other\nconventional beam tracking schemes.

Magnetic guidance of the electrode array has been\nproposed to mitigate this medical complication. After insertion, the guiding\nmagnet attached to the tip of the electrode array must be detached via a\nheating process and removed. This heating process may, however, cause thermal\ntrauma within the cochlea. In this study, a validated three-dimensional finite\nelement heat transfer model of the human cochlea is applied to perform an\nintracochlear thermal analysis necessary to ensure the safety of the magnet\nremoval phase. Specifically, the maximum safe input power density to detach the\nmagnet is determined as a function of the boundary conditions, heating\nduration, cochlea size, implant electrode array radius and insertion depth,\nmagnet size, and cochlear fluid. A dimensional analysis and numerical\nsimulations reveal that the maximum safe input power density increases with\nincreasing cochlea size and the radius of the electrode array, whereas it\ndecreases with increasing electrode array insertion depth and magnet size. The\nbest cochlear fluids from the thermal perspective are perilymph and a soap\nsolution.

For the small variations, such interactions\ncan be always related to the response function. However, the form of this\nrelation can depend on additional approximations. Particularly, the commonly\nused magnetic force theorem (MFT) prescribes the linear relation between the\nexchange interactions and the response function, while the exact theory\nrequires this dependence to be inverse.

While in most of these cases, MFT\nproduces quite reasonable results and can be rigorously justifies in the long\nwavelength and strong-coupling limits, the exact formulation appears to be more\nconsistent, especially in dealing with two important issues, which typically\narise in the theory of exchange interactions: (i) the treatment of the ligand\nstates, and (ii) the choice of the suitable variable for the description of\ninfinitesimal rotations of spins.

In this model, a\nqueue gets to send a packet each step to one of the servers, which will attempt\nto serve the oldest arriving packet, and unprocessed packets are returned to\neach queue. We model this as a repeated game where queues compete for the\ncapacity of the servers, but where the state of the game evolves as the length\nof each queue varies, resulting in a highly dependent random process. Earlier\nwork by the authors [EC'20] shows that with no-regret learners, the system\nneeds twice the capacity as would be required in the coordinated setting to\nensure queue lengths remain stable despite the selfish behavior of the queues.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that this way of evaluating outcomes is myopic:\nif more patient queues choose strategies that selfishly maximize their long-run\nsuccess rate, stability can be ensured with just $\\frac{e}{e-1}\\approx 1.58$\ntimes extra capacity, better than what is possible assuming the no-regret\nproperty.\n  As these systems induce highly dependent processes, our analysis draws\nheavily on techniques from probability theory. Though these systems are random\nunder any fixed policies by the queues, we show that, surprisingly, these\nsystems have deterministic and explicit asymptotic behavior. We show that the\nasymptotic growth rates of queues can be written as a ratio of a submodular and\nmodular function, which provides significant game-theoretic properties. Our\nequilibrium analysis then relies on a novel deformation argument towards a more\nanalyzable solution that differs significantly from previous price of anarchy\nresults. While the intermediate points will not be equilibria, this analytic\nstructure will ensure that this deformation is monotonic along this continuous\npath.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 04:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-23"}

To address this, we propose a dynamic\non-demand network (DoDNet) that learns to segment multiple organs and tumors on\npartially labeled datasets. DoDNet consists of a shared encoder-decoder\narchitecture, a task encoding module, a controller for generating dynamic\nconvolution filters, and a single but dynamic segmentation head. The\ninformation of the current segmentation task is encoded as a task-aware prior\nto tell the model what the task is expected to solve. Different from existing\napproaches which fix kernels after training, the kernels in dynamic head are\ngenerated adaptively by the controller, conditioned on both input image and\nassigned task. Thus, DoDNet is able to segment multiple organs and tumors, as\ndone by multiple networks or a multi-head network, in a much efficient and\nflexible manner.

Hence, accurate\nprediction of maximum internal stress is critical to predicting time to failure\nand improving the fracture resistance and reliability of materials. Existing\nhigh-fidelity methods, such as the Finite-Discrete Element Model (FDEM), are\nlimited by their high computational cost. Therefore, to reduce computational\ncost while preserving accuracy, a novel deep learning model, \"StressNet,\" is\nproposed to predict the entire sequence of maximum internal stress based on\nfracture propagation and the initial stress data. More specifically, the\nTemporal Independent Convolutional Neural Network (TI-CNN) is designed to\ncapture the spatial features of fractures like fracture path and spall regions,\nand the Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (Bi-LSTM) Network is adapted to\ncapture the temporal features. By fusing these features, the evolution in time\nof the maximum internal stress can be accurately predicted. Moreover, an\nadaptive loss function is designed by dynamically integrating the Mean Squared\nError (MSE) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), to reflect the\nfluctuations in maximum internal stress. After training, the proposed model is\nable to compute accurate multi-step predictions of maximum internal stress in\napproximately 20 seconds, as compared to the FDEM run time of 4 hours, with an\naverage MAPE of 2% relative to test data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 05:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-23"}

Magnetic relaxation studies using\nCole-Cole formalism reveal a Debye-type relaxation with a nearly negligible\ndistribution in relaxation times. In contrast to the archetypical skyrmion\nhosts, the high Curie temperature ($ T_C $) of the present system ensures\nshorter switching times, and, correspondingly, higher frequencies are required\nto probe the relaxation dynamics. We find a non-monotonic variation in the\ncharacteristic relaxation time with distinct maxima at the phase boundaries\n\\textit{via} helical $\\longrightarrow$ antiskyrmion $\\longrightarrow$\nfield-polarized states, indicating slower magnetization dynamics over the\nregion of phase coexistence. The temperature-dependent relaxation time across\ndifferent phases is of the order of $ 10^{-5} - 10^{-4} $ s and follows the\nwell-known Arrhenius law with reasonable values of the energy barriers. The\npresent study concerning the magnetization dynamics in the antiskyrmion host\ntetragonal Heusler system is an important contribution towards the basic\nunderstanding of the dynamical aspects of antiskyrmions for their potential\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 06:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-23"}

Most of them had\ncomputer access at home but only a few had Internet access at home. Gamers\ntended to play games in cyber caf\\'es at least three times a week, usually in\nthe evening, for at least two hours per visit. They also reported that they\nplayed games frequently. Majority of the gamers were fond of playing DOTA,\nLeague of Legends, and CABAL and they had been playing games for at least two\nyears. It was disclosed that they exhibited both positive and negative emotions\nwhile playing games. It was shown that gamers were inclined to be more anxious\nto be defeated in a game as gaming became frequent and length of years in\nplaying games increased. They also had the tendency to become more stressed\nwhen length of years of playing games increased. On the other hand, other\ngaming behaviors were not significantly related to other emotions. Thus, the\nnull hypothesis stating that gaming behaviors of the respondents are not\nsignificantly related to the emotions exhibited while playing the computer\ngames is partially rejected. Therefore, not all emotions exhibited while\nplaying computer games could be attributed to their gaming behaviors. It is\nrecommended that other emotions such as anger, frustration, boredom, amusement,\netc. be included in future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 08:18:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-23"}

Tools to study solar magnetic fields include magnetic topology and\nfeatures such as magnetic null points, separatrix surfaces, and separators. The\ntheory of these has most robustly been developed under magnetic charge\ntopology, where the sources of the magnetic field are taken to be discrete, but\nobserved magnetic fields are continuously distributed, and reconstructions and\nnumerical simulations typically use continuously distributed magnetic boundary\nconditions. This article investigates the pitfalls in using continuous source\ndescriptions, particularly when null points on the $z=0$ plane are obscured by\nthe continuous flux distribution through, e.g., the overlap of non-point\nsources. The idea of null-like points on the boundary is introduced where the\nparallel requirement on the field $B_{\\parallel}=0$ is retained but the\nrequirement on the perpendicular component is relaxed, i.e., $B_{\\perp}\\ne0$.\nThese allow the definition of separatrix-like surfaces which are shown (through\nuse of a squashing factor) to be a class of quasi-separatrix layer, and\nseparator-like lines which retain the x-line structure of separators. Examples\nare given that demonstrate that the use of null-like points can reinstate\ntopological features that are eliminated in the transition from discrete to\ncontinuous sources, and that their inclusion in more involved cases can enhance\nunderstanding of the magnetic structure and even change the resulting\nconclusions. While the examples in this article use the potential\napproximation, the definition of null-like points is more general and may be\nemployed in other cases such as force-free field extrapolations and MHD\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 08:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

While\nLapidoth and Marti (2020) derived coding theorems, associated with achievable\nchannel-coding rates (of the main encoder) for this model, here our focus is on\nerror exponents. We consider both continuous-alphabet, additive white Gaussian\nchannels and finite-alphabet, modulo-additive channels, and for each one of\nthem, we study the cases of both fixed-rate and variable-rate noise\ndescriptions by the helper. Our main finding is that, as long as the\nchannel-coding rate, $R$, is below the helper-rate, $R_{\\mbox{\\tiny h}}$, the\nachievable error exponent is unlimited (i.e., it can be made arbitrarily\nlarge), and in some of the cases, it is even strictly infinite (i.e., the error\nprobability can be made strictly zero).

By collaboratively training a shared\nlearning model at edge devices, FL avoids direct data transmission and thus\novercomes high communication latency and privacy issues as compared to\ncentralized ML. To improve the communication efficiency in FL model\naggregation, over-the-air computation has been introduced to support a large\nnumber of simultaneous local model uploading by exploiting the inherent\nsuperposition property of wireless channels. However, due to the heterogeneity\nof communication capacities among edge devices, over-the-air FL suffers from\nthe straggler issue in which the device with the weakest channel acts as a\nbottleneck of the model aggregation performance. This issue can be alleviated\nby device selection to some extent, but the latter still suffers from a\ntradeoff between data exploitation and model communication.

In contrast,\nboth positive- and negative-sequence synchronizations should be of concern for\ninverter-based generation (IBG) under asymmetrical faults. This is because the\nlatest grid codes stipulate that IBG should inject dual-sequence current when\nriding through asymmetrical faults. Currently, much less is known about the\nsynchronization stability during asymmetrical faults. This significantly\ndiffers from the positive-sequence synchronization alone because the coupled\ndual-sequence synchronization is involved.

This is\na rare condition, previously reported in only four families. In contrast,\nheterozygous GRN mutations are a major cause of frontotemporal dementia\nassociated with neuronal cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions. We identified\nhomozygous GRN mutations in six new patients. The phenotypic spectrum is much\nbroader than previously reported, with two remarkably distinct presentations,\ndepending on the age of onset. A childhood/juvenile form is characterized by\nclassical CLN11 symptoms at an early age at onset. Unexpectedly, other\nhomozygous patients presented a distinct delayed phenotype of frontotemporal\ndementia and parkinsonism after 50 years; none had epilepsy or cerebellar\nataxia. Another major finding of this study is that all GRN mutations may not\nhave the same impact on progranulin protein synthesis. A hypomorphic effect of\nsome mutations is supported by the presence of residual levels of plasma\nprogranulin and low levels of normal transcript detected in one case with a\nhomozygous splice-site mutation and late onset frontotemporal dementia. This is\na new critical finding that must be considered in therapeutic trials based on\nreplacement strategies. The first neuropathological study in a homozygous\ncarrier provides new insights into the pathological mechanisms of the disease.\nHallmarks of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis were present. The absence of TDP-43\ncytoplasmic inclusions markedly differs from observations of heterozygous\nmutations, suggesting a pathological shift between lysosomal and TDP-43\npathologies depending on the mono or bi-allelic status. An intriguing\nobservation was the loss of normal TDP-43 staining in the nucleus of some\nneurons, which could be the first stage of the TDP-43 pathological process\npreceding the formation of typical cytoplasmic inclusions. Finally, this study\nhas important implications for genetic counselling and molecular diagnosis.\nSemi-dominant inheritance of GRN mutations implies that specific genetic\ncounseling should be delivered to children and parents of CLN11 patients, as\nthey are heterozygous carriers with a high risk of developing dementia. More\nbroadly, this study illustrates the fact that genetic variants can lead to\ndifferent phenotypes according to their mono- or bi-allelic state, which is a\nchallenge for genetic diagnosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 10:16:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-23"}

Bipedal walking is inherently\ncomplex and difficult to control due to the high level of nonlinearity and\nsignificant number of degrees of freedom of the concerned robots, the limited\nobservability and controllability of the corresponding states, and the\ncombination of imperfect actuation with less-than-ideal sensing. The presented\nmethods deal with these issues in a multitude of ways, ranging from the\ndevelopment of an actuator control and feed-forward compensation scheme, to the\ninclusion of filtering in almost all of the gait stabilisation feedback\npipelines. Two gaits are developed and investigated, the direct fused angle\nfeedback gait, and the tilt phase controller. Both gaits follow the design\nphilosophy of leveraging a semi-stable open-loop gait generator, and extending\nit through stabilising feedback via the means of so-called corrective actions.\nThe idea of using corrective actions is to modify the generation of the\nopen-loop joint waveforms in such a way that the balance of the robot is\ninfluenced and thereby ameliorated. Examples of such corrective actions include\nmodifications of the arm swing and leg swing trajectories, the application of\ndynamic positional and rotational offsets to the hips and feet, and adjustments\nof the commanded step size and timing. Underpinning both feedback gaits and\ntheir corresponding gait generators are significant advances in the field of 3D\nrotation theory. These advances include the development of three novel rotation\nrepresentations, the tilt angles, fused angles, and tilt phase space\nrepresentations. All three of these representations are founded on a new\ninnovative way of splitting 3D rotations into their respective yaw and tilt\ncomponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 11:01:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 10:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-24"}

These\nvortices are named after the local ordered state, ferromagnetic (F),\nantiferromagnetic (AF), broken-axisymmetry (BA), and normal (N) states apart\nfrom the bulk polar (P) state. The N-core vortex is a conventional vortex, in\nthe core of which the superfluid order parameter vanishes. The other two types\nof vortices are stabilized when the quadratic Zeeman energy is smaller than a\ncritical value. The axisymmetric F-core vortex is the lowest-energy vortex for\nferromagnetic interaction, and it has an F core surrounded by a BA skin that\nforms a ferromagnetic-spin texture, as exemplified by the localized Mermin--Ho\ntexture. The elliptic AF-core vortex is stabilized for antiferromagnetic\ninteraction; the vortex core has both nematic-spin and ferromagnetic orders\nlocally and is composed of the AF-core soliton spanned between two BA edges.\nThe phase transition from the N-core vortex to the other two vortices is\ncontinuous, whereas that between the AF-core and F-core vortices is\ndiscontinuous. The critical point of the continuous vortex-core transition is\ncomputed by the perturbation analysis of the Bogoliubov theory and the\nGinzburg--Landau formalism describes the critical behavior.

In this paper, we report on our experiences\napplying model checking to verify the arbitration logic of a Vehicle Control\nSystem. We balance pros and cons of different model checking techniques and\ntools, and reason about our choice of the symbolic model checker NuSMV. We\ndescribe the process of modeling the architecture, resulting in ~1500 LOC, 69\nstate variables and 38 LTL constraints. To handle this large-scale model, we\nautomate and optimize the model checking procedure for use on multi-core CPUs\nand employ Bounded Model Checking to avoid the state explosion problem. We\nshare our lessons learned and provide valuable insights for architects,\ndevelopers, and test engineers involved in this highly present topic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 11:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

Among them, Hyperloglog has been widely\nadopted in both software and hardware implementations. The security of\nHyperloglog has been recently studied showing that an attacker can create a set\nof elements that produces a cardinality estimate that is much smaller than the\nreal cardinality of the set. This set can be used for example to evade\ndetection systems that use Hyperloglog. In this paper, the security of\nHyperloglog is considered from the opposite angle: the attacker wants to create\na small set that when inserted on the Hyperloglog produces a large cardinality\nestimate. This set can be used to trigger false alarms in detection systems\nthat use Hyperloglog but more interestingly, it can be potentially used to\ninflate the visits to websites or the number of hits of online advertisements.\nOur analysis shows that an attacker can create a set with a number of elements\nequal to the number of registers used in the Hyperloglog implementation that\nproduces any arbitrary cardinality estimate. This has been validated in two\ncommercial implementations of Hyperloglog: Presto and Redis. Based on those\nresults, we also consider the protection of Hyperloglog against such an attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 11:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-23"}

While such restrictions on\nthe structure of constraint graphs do not seem to limit the expressiveness of\nNCL, the building blocks of the constraint graphs cannot be limited without\nlosing expressiveness: We consider as parameters the number of weight-one edges\nand the number of weight-two edges of a constraint graph, as well as the number\nof \\textsc{and}\\xspace or \\textsc{or}\\xspace vertices of an\n\\textsc{and/or}\\xspace constraint graph. We show that NCL is fixed-parameter\ntractable (FPT) for any of these parameters. In particular, for NCL\nparameterized by the number of weight-one edges or the number of\n\\textsc{and}\\xspace vertices, we obtain a linear kernel. It follows that, in a\nsense, NCL as introduced by Hearn and Demaine is defined in the most economical\nway for the purpose of capturing \\PSPACE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 12:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-23"}

However,\nin recent years, the security of locking schemes has been thoroughly challenged\nby the introduction of various deobfuscation attacks. As in most research\nbranches, deep learning is being introduced in the domain of logic locking as\nwell. Therefore, in this paper we present SnapShot: a novel attack on logic\nlocking that is the first of its kind to utilize artificial neural networks to\ndirectly predict a key bit value from a locked synthesized gate-level netlist\nwithout using a golden reference. Hereby, the attack uses a simpler yet more\nflexible learning model compared to existing work. Two different approaches are\nevaluated. The first approach is based on a simple feedforward fully connected\nneural network. The second approach utilizes genetic algorithms to evolve more\ncomplex convolutional neural network architectures specialized for the given\ntask. The attack flow offers a generic and customizable framework for attacking\nlocking schemes using machine learning techniques. We perform an extensive\nevaluation of SnapShot for two realistic attack scenarios, comprising both\nreference benchmark circuits as well as silicon-proven RISC-V core modules. The\nevaluation results show that SnapShot achieves an average key prediction\naccuracy of 82.60% for the selected attack scenario, with a significant\nperformance increase of 10.49 percentage points compared to the state of the\nart. Moreover, SnapShot outperforms the existing technique on all evaluated\nbenchmarks. The results indicate that the security foundation of common logic\nlocking schemes is build on questionable assumptions.

First, we analyzed long-cadence $K2$\nphotometry to characterize its transient events (e.g., flares) and global and\nsurface differential rotation. Then, from the Mount Wilson $S$-indexes derived\nfrom CASLEO spectra and other public observations, we analyzed its long-term\nactivity between 1998 and 2020 with four different time-domain techniques to\ndetect cyclic patterns.

This algorithm incorporates the atomic norm denoising sparse\nrecovery method to exploit channel sparsity. Splicing clean CSI over M\nfrequency bands, we use orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) as an estimation\nmethod to recover the sparse CIR with high (M-fold) resolution. Unlike previous\nworks in the literature, our method does not appeal to any limiting assumption\non the CIR (other than the widely accepted sparsity assumption) or any ad hoc\nprocessing for distortion removal. We show, empirically, that the proposed\nmethod outperforms the state of the art in terms of localization accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 13:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-23"}

Operating the ion\nsource in controlled turbulence regime allows increasing the absorbed power\ndensity and therefore the volumetric plasma energy content in the dense part of\nthe discharge surrounded by the ECR surface, which leads to enhanced beam\ncurrents of high charge state ions. We report experiments at the ECR ion source\nat the JYFL accelerator laboratory, in which adopting of a new approach allows\nto increase the multicharged ion beam current up to two times, e.g. to 95\n$\\mu$A of O$^{7+}$ achieved with mere 280 W power at 11.56 GHz.

The approach is based on the\ndensity functional theory calculations. We apply it to the problem of obtaining\nof Ti-doped sapphire crystals with high figure-of-merit (FOM). The FOM of a\ngiven sample is defined as the ratio of the coefficient of absorption at the\npump frequency to the coefficient of absorption at the working frequency of\nTi:sapphire laser. It is believed that FOM is proportional to the ratio of the\nconcentration of isolated Ti$^{3+}$ ions to the concentration of\nTi$^{3+}$-Ti$^{4+}$ pairs. We find that generally this ratio is in inverse\nproportion to the concentration of Ti$^{4+}$ isolated substitutional defects\nwith the coefficient of proportionality that depends on the temperature at\nwhich the thermodynamically equilibrium concentration of defects is reached. We\nargue that in certain cases the inverse proportion between concentrations of\nTi$^{3+}$-Ti$^{4+}$ and Ti$^{4+}$ may be violated. We show that codopants that\nform positively (negatively) charged defects may decrease (increase) the\nconcentration of positively charged defects formed by the main dopants. To\nevaluate the effect of codoping it is important to take into account not only\nisolated defects but defect complexes formed by codopants, as well. In\nparticular, we show that codoping of Ti:sapphire with nitrogen results in an\nessential increase of the concentration of Ti$^{4+}$ and in a decrease of the\nFOM, and, consequently, growth or annealing in the presence of nitrogen or its\ncompounds is unfavorable for producing Ti:sapphire laser crystals. The approach\ndeveloped can be used for determining appropriate growth and annealing\nconditions for obtaining doped crystals with the required characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 14:16:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 11:14:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

One possible avenue is the search for serendipitous\noptical/near-infrared counterparts of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and\ngravitational-wave (GW) signals, known as kilonovae. With surveys such as the\nZwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which observes the sky with a cadence of ~\nthree days, the existing counterpart locations are likely to be observed;\nhowever, due to the significant amount of sky to explore, it is difficult to\nsearch for these fast-evolving candidates. Thus, it is beneficial to optimize\nthe survey cadence for realtime kilonova identification and enable further\nphotometric and spectroscopic observations. We explore how the cadence of wide\nfield-of-view surveys like ZTF can be improved to facilitate such\nidentifications. We show that with improved observational choices, e.g., the\nadoption of three epochs per night on a ~ nightly basis, and the prioritization\nof redder photometric bands, detection efficiencies improve by about a factor\nof two relative to the nominal cadence. We also provide realistic hypothetical\nconstraints on the kilonova rate as a form of comparison between strategies,\nassuming that no kilonovae are detected throughout the long-term execution of\nthe respective observing plan. These results demonstrate how an optimal use of\nZTF increases the likelihood of kilonova discovery independent of GWs or GRBs,\nthereby allowing for a sensitive search with less interruption of its nominal\ncadence through Target of Opportunity programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 14:24:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 15:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

This orbital evolution drives a similar evolution of\nthe minimum CBP semi-major axis for orbital stability. By expanding on previous\nmodels to include the evolution of the mass concentration, we show that the\nmaximum in the CBP orbital stability limit tends to occur 100 Myr after the\nplanets form, a factor of 100 longer than previous investigations. This result\nprovides further support for the hypothesis that the early stellar-tidal\nevolution of binary stars has removed CBPs from short-period binaries.

As a slow wave propagates through a plasma,\nit modifies the equilibrium quantities of density, temperature, and magnetic\nfield. In the corona and other plasma systems, the thermal equilibrium is\ncomprised of a balance between continuous heating and cooling processes, the\nmagnitudes of which vary with density, temperature and magnetic field. Thus the\nwave may induce a misbalance between these competing processes. Its back\nreaction on the wave has been shown to lead to dispersion, and amplification or\ndamping, of the wave. In this work the importance of the effect of magnetic\nfield in the rapid damping of slow waves in the solar corona by heating/cooling\nmisbalance is evaluated and compared to the effects of thermal conduction. The\ntwo timescales characterising the effect of misbalance are derived and\ncalculated for plasma systems with a range of typical coronal conditions. The\npredicted damping times of slow waves from thermal misbalance in the solar\ncorona are found to be of the order of 10-100 minutes, coinciding with the wave\nperiods and damping times observed. Moreover the slow wave damping by thermal\nmisbalance is found to be comparable to the damping by field-aligned thermal\nconduction. We show that in the infinite field limit, the wave dynamics is\ninsensitive to the dependence of the heating function on the magnetic field,\nand this approximation is found to be valid in the corona so long as the\nmagnetic field strength is greater than 10G for quiescent loops and plumes and\n100G for hot and dense loops. In summary thermal misbalance may damp slow\nmagnetoacoustic waves rapidly in much of the corona, and its inclusion in our\nunderstanding of slow mode damping may resolve discrepancies between\nobservations and theory relying on compressive viscosity and thermal conduction\nalone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 15:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Therefore, it is important to develop new techniques that\ncan exploit the huge quantity of data that future observations will give us\naccess to in the most effective way possible. For this reason, we decided to\ninvestigate the development of a new method to treat weak lensing higher order\nstatistics, which are known to break degeneracy among cosmological parameters\nthanks to their capability of probing the non-Gaussian properties of the shear\nfield. In particular, the proposed method directly applies to the observed\nquantity, i.e., the noisy galaxy ellipticity.

This allowed us to construct datasets with\ndifferent size, precision, and smoothing. We then applied several machine\nlearning algorithms to determine which method best predicts the actual\ncosmological parameters associated with each simulation. The best model\nresulted to be simple multidimensional linear regression. We used this model to\ncompare the results coming from the different datasets and found out that we\ncan measure with good accuracy the majority of the parameters that we\nconsidered. We also investigated the relation between each higher order\nestimator and the different cosmological parameters for several signal-to-noise\nthresholds and redshifts bins.

Time-resolved spectroscopy of the three Type-I bursts revealed typical\ncharacteristics expected for these phenomena. All three Type-I bursts show slow\nrises and long decays, indicative of mixed H/He fuel. We find no strong\nevidence that any of the Type-I bursts reached the Eddington Luminosity;\nhowever, under the assumption that the brightest X-ray burst underwent\nphotospheric radius expansion, we estimate a <12.4kpc upper limit for the\ndistance. We searched for burst oscillations during the Type-I bursts from MAXI\nJ1807+132 and found none (<10% amplitude upper limit at 95% confidence level).\nFinally, we found that the brightest Type-I burst shows a ~1.6sec pause during\nthe rise. This pause is similar to one recently found with NICER in a bright\nType-I burst from the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. The\nfact that Type-I bursts from both sources can show this type of pause suggests\nthat the origin of the pauses is independent of the composition of the burning\nfuel, the peak luminosity of the Type-I bursts, or whether the NS is an X-ray\npulsar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 15:23:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-23"}

However, most existing FL or distributed learning\nframeworks have not well addressed two important issues together: collaborative\nfairness and adversarial robustness (e.g. free-riders and malicious\nparticipants). In conventional FL, all participants receive the global model\n(equal rewards), which might be unfair to the high-contributing participants.\nFurthermore, due to the lack of a safeguard mechanism, free-riders or malicious\nadversaries could game the system to access the global model for free or to\nsabotage it. In this paper, we propose a novel Robust and Fair Federated\nLearning (RFFL) framework to achieve collaborative fairness and adversarial\nrobustness simultaneously via a reputation mechanism. RFFL maintains a\nreputation for each participant by examining their contributions via their\nuploaded gradients (using vector similarity) and thus identifies\nnon-contributing or malicious participants to be removed. Our approach\ndifferentiates itself by not requiring any auxiliary/validation dataset.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that RFFL can achieve high\nfairness and is very robust to different types of adversaries while achieving\ncompetitive predictive accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 15:52:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 12:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

The amount of data from current and\nupcoming surveys calls for robust and objective procedures to detect structure,\nso the results can be statistically analysed and different regions compared. We\nprovide the community with a tool able to detect the small scale significant\nstructure, above random expectation, in star-forming regions, which could be\nthe imprint of the stellar formation process. The tool makes use of the one\npoint correlation function and of nearest neighbour statistics to determine the\nparameters for the DBSCAN algorithm. The procedure successfully detects\nsignificant small scale substructures in heterogeneous regions, fulfilling the\ngoals it was designed for, and providing very reliable structures. The analysis\nof regions close to complete spatial randomness ($Q \\in [0.7,0.87]$) shows\nthat, even when some structure is present and recovered, it is hardly\ndistinguishable from spurious detection in homogeneous regions due to\nprojection effects. Interpretation should thus be done with care. For\nconcentrated regions, we detect a main structure surrounded by smaller ones,\ncorresponding to the core plus some Poisson fluctuations around it. We argue\nthat these structures do not correspond to the small compact regions we are\nlooking for. In some realistic cases, a more complete hierarchical, multi-scale\nanalysis would be needed to capture the complexity of the region.

We propose a novel online learning based\nrisk-averse stochastic MPC framework in which Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)\nconstraints on system states are required to hold for a family of distributions\ncalled an ambiguity set. The ambiguity set is constructed from disturbance data\nby leveraging a Dirichlet process mixture model that is self-adaptive to the\nunderlying data structure and complexity.

A\nnovel constraint tightening strategy is then developed based on an equivalent\nreformulation of distributionally ro-bust CVaR constraints over the proposed\nambiguity set. As more data are gathered during the runtime of the controller,\nthe ambiguity set is updated online using real-time disturbance data, which\nenables the risk-averse stochastic MPC to cope with time-varying disturbance\ndistributions. The online variational inference algorithm employed does not\nrequire all collected data be learned from scratch, and therefore the proposed\nMPC is endowed with the guaranteed computational complexity of online learning.\nThe guarantees on recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability of the\nproposed MPC are established via a safe update scheme.

The majority of such efforts have\nfocused on looking for attention patterns and then hard-coding them to achieve\nsparseness, or pruning the weights of the attention mechanisms based on\nstatistical information from the training data.

Time series data from multiple modalities such as physiological and\nmotion sensor data have proven to be integral for measuring and quantifying\nemotions. Monitoring emotional trajectories over long periods of time inherits\nsome critical limitations in relation to the size of the training data. This\nshortcoming may hinder the development of reliable and accurate machine\nlearning models. To address this problem, this paper proposes a framework to\ntackle the limitation in performing emotional state recognition on multiple\nmultimodal datasets: 1) encoding multivariate time series data into coloured\nimages; 2) leveraging pre-trained object recognition models to apply a Transfer\nLearning (TL) approach using the images from step 1; 3) utilising a 1D\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform emotion classification from\nphysiological data; 4) concatenating the pre-trained TL model with the 1D CNN.\nFurthermore, the possibility of performing TL to infer stress from\nphysiological data is explored by initially training a 1D CNN using a large\nphysical activity dataset and then applying the learned knowledge to the target\ndataset. We demonstrate that model performance when inferring real-world\nwellbeing rated on a 5-point Likert scale can be enhanced using our framework,\nresulting in up to 98.5% accuracy, outperforming a conventional CNN by 4.5%.\nSubject-independent models using the same approach resulted in an average of\n72.3% accuracy (SD 0.038).

In this paper, we show that CoL-web, a web extension to\nCoL, naturally supports web programming where database updates are involved. To\nbe specific, we discuss an implementation of the AI ATM based on CoL (CL9 to be\nexact). More importantly, we argue that CoL-web supports a general AI and,\ntherefore, is a good alternative to neural nets and deep learning. We also\ndiscuss how to integrate neural nets into CoL-web.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 12:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}
