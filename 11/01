Towards this goal, one class\nof methods is to translate the image style from another environment to the one\non which models are trained. In this paper, we propose a weakly-paired setting\nfor the style translation, where the content in the two images is aligned with\nerrors in poses. These images could be acquired by different sensors in\ndifferent conditions that share an overlapping region, e.g. with LiDAR or\nstereo cameras, from sunny days or foggy nights. We consider this setting to be\nmore practical with: (i) easier labeling than the paired data; (ii) better\ninterpretability and detail retrieval than the unpaired data. To translate\nacross such images, we propose PREGAN to train a style translator by\nintentionally transforming the two images with a random pose, and to estimate\nthe given random pose by differentiable non-trainable pose estimator given that\nthe more aligned in style, the better the estimated result is. Such adversarial\ntraining enforces the network to learn the style translation, avoiding being\nentangled with other variations.

Many VC systems use\ndisentangle-based learning techniques to separate the speaker and the\nlinguistic content information from a speech signal.

To\nprevent the speaker information from leaking into the content embeddings,\nprevious works either reduce the dimension or quantize the content embedding as\na strong information bottleneck. These mechanisms somehow hurt the synthesis\nquality. In this work, we propose AGAIN-VC, an innovative VC system using\nActivation Guidance and Adaptive Instance Normalization.

With a\nproper activation as an information bottleneck on content embeddings, the\ntrade-off between the synthesis quality and the speaker similarity of the\nconverted speech is improved drastically.

The second virial coefficient is a physical quantity that\ncharacterizes the magnitude and sign of pairwise interactions between\nparticles, and hence is related to aggregation propensity, a property of\nconsiderable scientific and practical interest. Estimating the second virial\ncoefficient from experimental data is challenging due both to the degree of\nprecision required and the complexity of the error structure involved.

A typical method to\ninvestigate the effects of these policy shifts is to use surveys. However,\nsurvey-based approaches have multiple limitations: biased responses, limited\nsample size, badly crafted questions may skew responses and inhibit insight,\nand responses may prove quickly irrelevant as opinions change in response to a\ndynamic topic. We propose a novel approach to 1) accurately gauge public\nsentiment towards face masks in the United States during COVID-19 using a\nmulti-modal demographic inference framework with topic modeling and 2)\ndetermine whether face mask policy shifts contributed to polarization towards\nface masks using offline change point analysis on Twitter data.

To circumvent a potentially dense\ntwo-body interaction tensor and obtain lower asymptotic costs for quantum\nsimulations of chemistry, the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) procedure using a\nrectangular partitioning strategy was recently piloted [McClean et al, New J.\nPhys. 22, 093015, 2020]. The DG approach interpolates in a controllable way\nbetween a compact description of the two-body interaction tensor through\nmolecular orbitals and a diagonal characterization through primitive basis\nsets, such as a planewave dual basis set. The DG procedure gives rise to a\nblock-diagonal representation of the two-body interaction with reduced number\nof two-electron repulsion integrals, which in turn reduces the cost of quantum\nsimulations. In the present work we extend this approach to be applicable to\nmolecular and crystalline systems of arbitrary geometry. We take advantage of\nthe flexibility of the planewave dual basis set, and combine the discontinuous\nGalerkin procedure with a general partitioning strategy based on the Voronoi\ndecomposition. We numerically investigate the performance, at the mean-field\nand correlated levels, with quasi-1D, 2D and 3D partitions using hydrogen\nchains, H$_4$, CH$_4$ as examples, respectively.

This paper\nproposes a novel deep learning regularization method named as DL-Reg, which\ncarefully reduces the nonlinearity of deep networks to a certain extent by\nexplicitly enforcing the network to behave as much linear as possible. The key\nidea is to add a linear constraint to the objective function of the deep neural\nnetworks, which is simply the error of a linear mapping from the inputs to the\noutputs of the model. More precisely, the proposed DL-Reg carefully forces the\nnetwork to behave in a linear manner. This linear constraint, which is further\nadjusted by a regularization factor, prevents the network from the risk of\noverfitting. The performance of DL-Reg is evaluated by training\nstate-of-the-art deep network models on several benchmark datasets.

As\nthese are starting to become incorporated into the clinical workflow, a major\nconcern from clinicians is not whether the model is accurate, but whether the\nmodel can express to a human operator when it does not know if its answer is\ncorrect. We propose to use Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO) and the bootstrap\naggregation (bagging) technique on deep learning models to produce uncertainty\nestimations for radiation therapy dose prediction. We show that both models are\ncapable of generating a reasonable uncertainty map, and, with our proposed\nscaling technique, creating interpretable uncertainties and bounds on the\nprediction and any relevant metrics. Performance-wise, bagging provides\nstatistically significant reduced loss value and errors in most of the metrics\ninvestigated in this study. The addition of bagging was able to further reduce\nerrors by another 0.34% for Dmean and 0.19% for Dmax, on average, when compared\nto the baseline framework. Overall, the bagging framework provided\nsignificantly lower MAE of 2.62, as opposed to the baseline framework's MAE of\n2.87. The usefulness of bagging, from solely a performance standpoint, does\nhighly depend on the problem and the acceptable predictive error, and its high\nupfront computational cost during training should be factored in to deciding\nwhether it is advantageous to use it. In terms of deployment with uncertainty\nestimations turned on, both frameworks offer the same performance time of about\n12 seconds. As an ensemble-based metaheuristic, bagging can be used with\nexisting machine learning architectures to improve stability and performance,\nand MCDO can be applied to any deep learning models that have dropout as part\nof their architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2020 00:24:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 02:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

By doing so, we can exploit\na wide class of networks to approximate the nuisance functions and to estimate\nthe parameters of interest consistently. Therefore, we may offer the best of\ntwo worlds: the universal approximation ability from neural networks and the\ninterpretability from classic ordinary linear model, leading to both valid\ninference and accurate prediction. We show the theoretical foundations that\nmake this possible and demonstrate with numerical experiments. Furthermore, we\npropose a framework, DebiNet, in which we plug-in arbitrary feature selection\nmethods to our semi-parametric neural network.

Though there are some protection\noptions such as differential privacy (DP) and monitoring, which are considered\npromising techniques to mitigate this attack, we still find that the\nvulnerability persists. In this paper, we propose an adaptive query-flooding\nparameter duplication (QPD) attack. The adversary can infer the model\ninformation with black-box access and no prior knowledge of any model\nparameters or training data via QPD. We also develop a defense strategy using\nDP called monitoring-based DP (MDP) against this new attack. In MDP, we first\npropose a novel real-time model extraction status assessment scheme called\nMonitor to evaluate the situation of the model. Then, we design a method to\nguide the differential privacy budget allocation called APBA adaptively.\nFinally, all DP-based defenses with MDP could dynamically adjust the amount of\nnoise added in the model response according to the result from Monitor and\neffectively defends the QPD attack. Furthermore, we thoroughly evaluate and\ncompare the QPD attack and MDP defense performance on real-world models with DP\nand monitoring protection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2020 04:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

Further, we observe significant variation in\nperformance across ISPs in conjunction with the traffic volume shifts, with\nevident latency increases after stay-at-home orders were issued, followed by a\nstabilization of traffic after April. Finally, we observe that in response to\nchanges in usage, ISPs have aggressively augmented capacity at interconnects,\nat more than twice the rate of normal capacity augmentation. Similarly, video\nconferencing applications have increased their network footprint, more than\ndoubling their advertised IP address space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2020 04:22:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Quadrotors' agility and ability to hover makes them well\nsuited for navigating potentially tight spaces, while fixed wing aircraft are\ncapable of efficient flight over long distances. Hybrid aerial vehicles (HAVs)\nattempt to achieve both of these benefits by exhibiting multiple modes;\nhowever, morphing HAVs typically require extra actuators which add mass,\nreducing both agility and efficiency. We propose a morphing HAV with folding\nwings that exhibits both a quadrotor and a fixed wing mode without requiring\nany extra actuation. This is achieved by leveraging the motion of a bistable\nmechanism at the center of the aircraft to drive folding of the wing using only\nthe existing motors and the inertia of the system. We optimize both the\nbistable mechanism and the folding wing using a topology optimization approach.\nThe resulting mechanisms were fabricated on a 3D printer and attached to an\nexisting quadrotor frame.

The sensed context can enable many services like navigation,\nAR, and smarting shopping. Such context can be sensed in different ways\nincluding visual sensors. There is an emergence of vision sources deployed\nworldwide. The cameras could be installed on roadside, in-house, and on mobile\nplatforms. This trend provides huge amount of vision data that could be used\nfor context sensing. However, the vision data collection and analytics are\nstill highly manual today. It is hard to deploy cameras at large scale for data\ncollection. Organizing and labeling context from the data are also labor\nintensive. In recent years, advanced vision algorithms and deep neural networks\nare used to help analyze vision data. But this approach is limited by data\nquality, labeling effort, and dependency on hardware resources. In summary,\nthere are three major challenges for today's vision-based context sensing\nsystems: data collection and labeling at large scale, process large data\nvolumes efficiently with limited hardware resources, and extract accurate\ncontext out of vision data. The thesis explores the design space that consists\nof three dimensions: sensing task, sensor types, and task locations. Our prior\nwork explores several points in this design space. We make contributions by (1)\ndeveloping efficient and scalable solutions for different points in the design\nspace of vision-based sensing tasks; (2) achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in\nthose applications; (3) and developing guidelines for designing such sensing\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2020 05:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

The key component is a minimal solution which\ncomputes the absolute camera pose with one 3D-2D correspondence and one 2D-2D\ncorrespondence. The advantages are obvious in two aspects. First, the\nrobustness is enhanced as the sample set for pose estimation is maximal by\nutilizing all correspondences with or without depth.

The\nsystem considered is essentially made of two linearly coupled Bose-Einstein\ncondensates, that is a pseudo-spin-$1/2$ system, subject to a spin-dependent\ngauge field $\\sigma_z \\hbar k_\\ell$. Under these conditions the stripe phase is\nachieved when the linear coupling $\\hbar\\Omega/2$ is small against the gauge\nenergy $m\\Omega/\\hbar k_\\ell^2<1$ .

Existing works use the so-called warm-starting of trajectory\noptimization to improve computational performance. We present a fundamentally\ndifferent approach that relies on deriving analytical gradients of the optimal\nsolution with respect to the task constraint parameters. This gradient map\ncharacterizes the direction in which the prior computed joint trajectories need\nto be deformed to comply with the new task constraints. Subsequently, we\ndevelop an iterative line-search algorithm for computing the scale of\ndeformation.

We relate each of these examples to\nreal-world applications ranging from learning from demonstration to obstacle\navoidance. We also show that our algorithm produces trajectories with quality\nsimilar to what one would obtain by solving the trajectory optimization from\nscratch with warm-start initialization.

The goal\nis to preprocess the input such that given a connected subgraph $H$ of $G$ and\na single query value $q$, one can find the predecessor of $q$ in every list\nthat belongs to $\\scat$. The classical result by Chazelle and Guibas shows that\nin a pointer machine, this can be done in the optimal time of $\\O(\\log n +\n|\\scat|)$ where $n$ is the total number of values.

As a promising beamforming solution, lens antenna array\n(LAA) implementation can provide a cost-effective solution without notable\nperformance degradation compared to its counterpart. However, an appropriate\nbeam selection is a challenge since it requires efficient channel estimation\nvia an extensive beam training process for perfect beam alignment. In this\npaper, we propose a high mobility beam and channel tracking algorithm based on\nthe unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to address this challenge, where the channel\nchanges can be monitored over a certain time. The proposed algorithm tracks the\nchannel changes after establishing a connection with an appropriate beam. The\nalgorithm is first introduced in a multi-user beamspace multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) system with LAA where a single beam is tracked at the\nuser side at downlink transmission. Then, it is employed for multi-beam\njoint-tracking at the base station side in the uplink transmission. The\nanalysis indicates that under different channel variation conditions, the\nproposed algorithm outmatches the popular extended Kalman filter (EKF) in both\nsingle-beam and multi-beam tracking systems. While it is common to individually\ntrack the beams in a multi-beam system scenario, the proposed joint tracking\napproach can provide around 62% performance enhancement compared to individual\nbeam tracking using the conventional EKF method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2020 14:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

It models set functions that exhibit a\ndiminishing returns property, where the marginal value of adding an element to\na set decreases as the set expands. This notion has been generalized to\nconsidering sequence functions, where the order of adding elements plays a\ncrucial role and determines the function value; the generalized notion is\ncalled sequence (or string) submodularity. In this paper, we study a new\nproblem of robust sequence submodular maximization with cardinality\nconstraints. The robustness is against the removal of a subset of elements in\nthe selected sequence (e.g., due to malfunctions or adversarial attacks).\nCompared to robust submodular maximization for set function, new challenges\narise when sequence functions are concerned. Specifically, there are multiple\ndefinitions of submodularity for sequence functions, which exhibit subtle yet\ncritical differences. Another challenge comes from two directions of\nmonotonicity: forward monotonicity and backward monotonicity, both of which are\nimportant to proving performance guarantees. To address these unique\nchallenges, we design two robust greedy algorithms: while one algorithm\nachieves a constant approximation ratio but is robust only against the removal\nof a subset of contiguous elements, the other is robust against the removal of\nan arbitrary subset of the selected elements but requires a stronger assumption\nand achieves an approximation ratio that depends on the number of the removed\nelements.

The unavailability of annotated\ncorpora in the languages of interest has always been a primary challenge when\ndeveloping speech recognition systems for this severely under-resourced type of\nspeech. Hence, it is worthwhile to investigate the potential of using speech\ncorpora available for other better-resourced languages to improve speech\nrecognition performance. To achieve this, we train a mBNF extractor using nine\nSouthern Bantu languages that form part of the freely available multilingual\nNCHLT corpus. We append these mBNFs to the existing MFCCs, pitch features and\ni-vectors to train acoustic models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) in\nthe target code-switched languages.

The chemical changes\nlead to appreciable changes in fluid properties, and these coupled multiphysics\nand the resulting multiscale dynamics are challenging to resolve numerically.\nUsing conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) requires excessive\ncomputing cost. Here, we propose a totally new efficient approach, assuming\nthat some sparse measurements of the state variables are available that can be\nseamlessly integrated in the simulation algorithm. We employ a special neural\nnetwork for approximating nonlinear operators, the DeepONet, which is used to\npredict separately each individual field, given inputs from the rest of the\nfields of the coupled multiphysics system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nDeepONet by predicting five species in the non-equilibrium chemistry downstream\nof a normal shock at high Mach numbers as well as the velocity and temperature\nfields. We show that upon training, DeepONets can be over five orders of\nmagnitude faster than the CFD solver employed to generate the training data and\nyield good accuracy for unseen Mach numbers within the range of training.\nOutside this range, DeepONet can still predict accurately and fast if a few\nsparse measurements are available. We then propose a composite supervised\nneural network, DeepM&Mnet, that uses multiple pre-trained DeepONets as\nbuilding blocks and scattered measurements to infer the set of all seven fields\nin the entire domain of interest. Two DeepM&Mnet architectures are tested, and\nwe demonstrate the accuracy and capacity for efficient data assimilation.\nDeepM&Mnet is simple and general: it can be employed to construct complex\nmultiphysics and multiscale models and assimilate sparse measurements using\npre-trained DeepONets in a \"plug-and-play\" mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2020 08:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

Deep learning has become a\npopular tool for protein representation learning as a model's hidden layers\nproduce potentially useful vector embeddings. TAPE introduced a number of\nbenchmark tasks and showed that semi-supervised learning, via pretraining\nlanguage models on a large protein corpus, improved performance on downstream\ntasks. Two of the tasks (fluorescence prediction and stability prediction)\ninvolve learning fitness landscapes. In this paper, we show that CNN models\ntrained solely using supervised learning both compete with and sometimes\noutperform the best models from TAPE that leverage expensive pretraining on\nlarge protein datasets. These CNN models are sufficiently simple and small that\nthey can be trained using a Google Colab notebook. We also find for the\nfluorescence task that linear regression outperforms our models and the TAPE\nmodels. The benchmarking tasks proposed by TAPE are excellent measures of a\nmodel's ability to predict protein function and should be used going forward.\nHowever, we believe it is important to add baselines from simple models to put\nthe performance of the semi-supervised models that have been reported so far\ninto perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2020 20:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-09"}

The statistical analysis to support the claim is\nflawed in that the sample set used to identify number-aware neurons is too\nsmall, compared to the huge number of neurons in the object recognition\nnetwork. By this flawed analysis one could mistakenly identify number-sensing\nneurons in any randomly initialized deep neural networks that are not trained\nat all. With the above critique we ask the question what if a deep\nconvolutional neural network is carefully trained for numerosity? Our findings\nare mixed.
