While the last decade has seen an\nexplosion of RSs aimed at identifying relevant items that match user\npreferences, there is still a range of aspects that could be considered to\nfurther improve their performance. For example, often RSs are centered around\nthe user, who is modeled using her recent sequence of activities. Recent\nstudies, however, have shown the effectiveness of modeling the mutual\ninteractions between users and items using separate user and item embeddings.\nBuilding on the success of these studies, we propose a novel method called\nDeePRed that addresses some of their limitations.

This enable us to train\nDeePRed using simple mini-batches without the overhead of specialized\nmini-batches proposed in previous studies. Moreover, DeePRed's effectiveness\ncomes from the aforementioned design and a multi-way attention mechanism that\ninspects user-item compatibility.

The existing device-end\nlearning based solutions tend to extract limited syntax features (e.g.,\npermissions and API calls) to meet a certain time constraint of mobile devices.\nHowever, syntax features lack the semantics which can represent the potential\nmalicious behaviors and further result in more robust model with high accuracy\nfor malware detection. In this paper, we propose an efficient Android malware\ndetection system, named SeqMobile, which adopts behavior-based sequence\nfeatures and leverages customized deep neural networks on mobile devices\ninstead of the server. Different from the traditional sequence-based approaches\non server, to meet the performance demand, SeqMobile accepts three effective\nperformance optimization methods to reduce the time cost. To evaluate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our system, we conduct experiments from the\nfollowing aspects 1) the detection accuracy of different recurrent neural\nnetworks; 2) the feature extraction performance on different mobile devices, 3)\nthe detection accuracy and prediction time cost of different sequence lengths.\nThe results unveil that SeqMobile can effectively detect malware with high\naccuracy. Moreover, our performance optimization methods have proven to improve\nthe performance of training and prediction by at least twofold. Additionally,\nto discover the potential performance optimization from the SOTA TensorFlow\nmodel optimization toolkit for our approach, we also provide an evaluation on\nthe toolkit, which can serve as a guidance for other systems leveraging on\nsequence-based learning approach.

We study two coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed between April\n1-2, 2019 by both the inner Wide-Field Imager for Parker Solar Probe (WISPR-I)\nand the inner heliospheric imager (HI-1) on board STEREO-A. This is the first\nstudy of CME observations from two viewpoints in similar directions but at\nconsiderably different solar distances. Aims. Our objective is to understand\nhow the PSP observations affect the CME kinematics, especially due to its\nproximity to the Sun. Methods. We estimate the CME positions, speeds,\naccelerations, propagation directions and longitudinal deflections using\nimaging observations from two spacecraft, and a set of analytical expressions\nthat consider the CME as a point structure and take into account the rapid\nchange in spacecraft position. Results. We find that both CMEs are slow ($<\n400\\ km\\ s^{-1}$), propagating eastward of the Sun-Earth line. The second CME\nseems to accelerate between $\\sim 0.1$ to $\\sim 0.2\\ au$ and deflect westward\nwith an angular speed consistent with the solar rotation speed. We find some\ndiscrepancies in the CME solar distance (up to $0.05\\ au$, particularly for CME\n\\#1), latitude (up to $\\sim10^{\\circ}$) and longitude (up to $24^{\\circ}$) when\ncomparing results from different fit cases (different observations or set of\nfree parameters). Conclusions. Discrepancies in longitude are likely due to the\nfeature tracked visually rather than instrumental biases or fit assumptions.\nFor similar reasons, the CME \\#1 solar distance, as derived from WISPR-I\nobservations, is larger than the HI-1 result, regardless of the fit parameters\nconsidered. Error estimates for CME kinematics do not show any clear trend\nassociated to the observing instrument. The source region location and the lack\nof any clear in situ counterparts (both at near-Earth and at PSP) support our\nestimate of the propagation direction for both events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 16:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Observations show the\ncoexistence of different temperature phases in such winds, which is not easy to\nexplain. We present a set of 3D shock-multicloud simulations that account for\nradiative heating and cooling at temperatures between $10^2\\,\\rm K$ and\n$10^7\\,\\rm K$. The interplay between shock heating, dynamical instabilities,\nturbulence, and radiative heating and cooling creates a complex multi-phase\nflow with a rain-like morphology. Cloud gas fragments and is continuously\neroded, becoming efficiently mixed and mass loaded. The resulting warm mixed\ngas then cools down and precipitates into new dense cloudlets, which repeat the\nprocess. Thus, radiative cooling is able to sustain fast-moving dense gas by\naiding condensation of gas from warm clouds and the hot wind. In the ensuing\noutflow, hot gas with temperatures $\\gtrsim 10^6\\,\\rm K$ outruns the warm and\ncold phases, which reach thermal equilibrium near $\\approx 10^4\\,\\rm K$ and\n$\\approx 10^2\\,\\rm K$, respectively. Although the volume filling factor of hot\ngas is higher in the outflow, most of the mass is concentrated in dense gas\ncloudlets and filaments with these temperatures. More porous multicloud layers\nresult in more vertically extended outflows, and dense gas is more efficiently\nproduced in more compact layers. The cold phase is not accelerated by\nram-pressure, but, instead, precipitates from warm and mixed gas out of thermal\nequilibrium.

The\ntraditional Machine Learning (ML) methods proposed in this domain generally\nfocus on utilizing highly discriminative features to improve the classification\nperformance, but this task is complicated by the well-known \"curse of\ndimensionality\" phenomena. Other approaches based on deep Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) have certain limitations and drawbacks, such as high\ncomputational complexity, an unfeasibly large training set with ground-truth\nlabels, and special hardware requirements. In this work, to address the\nlimitations of traditional ML and deep CNN based methods, a novel and\nsystematic classification framework is proposed for the classification of\nPolSAR images, based on a compact and adaptive implementation of CNNs using a\nsliding-window classification approach. The proposed approach has three\nadvantages. First, there is no requirement for an extensive feature extraction\nprocess. Second, it is computationally efficient due to utilized compact\nconfigurations. In particular, the proposed compact and adaptive CNN model is\ndesigned to achieve the maximum classification accuracy with minimum training\nand computational complexity. This is of considerable importance considering\nthe high costs involved in labelling in PolSAR classification. Finally, the\nproposed approach can perform classification using smaller window sizes than\ndeep CNNs. Experimental evaluations have been performed over the most\ncommonly-used four benchmark PolSAR images: AIRSAR L-Band and RADARSAT-2 C-Band\ndata of San Francisco Bay and Flevoland areas. Accordingly, the best obtained\noverall accuracies range between 92.33 - 99.39% for these benchmark study\nsites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 17:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

The syntactic translation can be defined for a wide\nrange of programming languages without knowledge of the particular game model\nused. Simple reasoning on the model (soundness, and adequacy) can be done at\nthe level of the metalanguage, escaping tedious technical proofs usually found\nin game semantics.

Whether or not information is aggregated\ndepends, inter alia, on the order in which agents decide. Thus, to decouple the\norder and the topology, our model studies a random arrival order.\n  Unlike the case of a fixed arrival order, in our model, the decision of an\nagent is unlikely to be affected by those who are far from him in the network.\nThis observation allows us to identify a local learning requirement, a natural\ncondition on the agent's neighborhood that guarantees that this agent makes the\ncorrect decision (with high probability) no matter how well other agents\nperform. Roughly speaking, the agent should belong to a multitude of mutually\nexclusive social circles.\n  We illustrate the power of the local learning requirement by constructing a\nfamily of social networks that guarantee information aggregation despite that\nno agent is a social hub (in other words, there are no opinion leaders).\nAlthough the common wisdom of the social learning literature suggests that\ninformation aggregation is very fragile, another application of the local\nlearning requirement demonstrates the existence of networks where learning\nprevails even if a substantial fraction of the agents are not involved in the\nlearning process.

The data, collected during 2015$-$2018 by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN\nLHC, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$. No deviations\nfrom the predictions of the Standard Model are observed and 95%\nconfidence-level upper limits between 2.45 fb and 0.5 fb are set on the visible\ncross section for contributions from physics beyond the Standard Model, in\ndifferent ranges of the missing transverse momentum. The results are\ninterpreted as 95% confidence-level limits in models where weakly interacting\ndark-matter candidates are pair-produced via an s-channel axial-vector or\nvector mediator. Dark-matter candidates with masses up to 415 (580) GeV are\nexcluded for axial-vector (vector) mediators, while the maximum excluded mass\nof the mediator is 1460 (1470) GeV. In addition, the results are expressed in\nterms of 95% confidence-level limits on the parameters of a model with an\naxion-like particle produced in association with a photon, and are used to\nconstrain the coupling $g_{aZ\\gamma}$ of an axion-like particle to the\nelectroweak gauge bosons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 17:26:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 10:42:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

ATCN is a family of\ncompact networks with formalized hyperparameters that enable\napplication-specific adjustments to be made to the model architecture. It is\nprimarily designed for embedded edge devices with very limited performance and\nmemory, such as wearable biomedical devices and real-time reliability\nmonitoring systems. ATCN makes fundamental improvements over the mainstream\ntemporal convolutional neural networks, including residual connections to\nincrease the network depth and accuracy, and the incorporation of separable\ndepth-wise convolution to reduce the computational complexity of the model. As\npart of the present work, two ATCN families, namely T0, and T1 are also\npresented and evaluated on different ranges of embedded processors - Cortex-M7\nand Cortex-A57 processor. An evaluation of the ATCN models against the\nbest-in-class InceptionTime and MiniRocket shows that ATCN almost maintains\naccuracy while improving the execution time on a broad range of embedded and\ncyber-physical applications with demand for real-time processing on the\nembedded edge. At the same time, in contrast to existing solutions, ATCN is the\nfirst time-series classifier based on deep learning that can be run bare-metal\non embedded microcontrollers (Cortex-M7) with limited computational performance\nand memory capacity while delivering state-of-the-art accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 17:26:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 23:30:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2021 07:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 22:08:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

Thus, focusing on the non-personalised (global)\nrecommendations in news media platforms (e.g., top-k trending topics on\nTwitter, top-k news on a news platform, etc.), we discuss on two specific\nfairness concerns together (traditionally studied separately)---user fairness\nand organisational fairness.

Even in our application of voting rules to the recommendation setup,\nwe observe high user satisfaction scores. Now for organisational fairness, we\npropose a bias metric which measures the aggregate ideological bias of a\nrecommended set of items (articles). Analysing the results obtained from voting\nrule-based recommendation, we find that while the well-known voting rules are\nbetter from the user side, they show high bias values and clearly not suitable\nfor organisational requirements of the platforms. Thus, there is a need to\nbuild an encompassing mechanism by cohesively bridging ideas of user fairness\nand organisational fairness. In this abstract paper, we intend to frame the\nelementary ideas along with the clear motivation behind the requirement of such\na mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 18:11:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

On the other hand,\ninformation-theoretic heuristics compute information gain as the mutual\ninformation between the map and the sensor's measurement. Although the gradient\nof such measures can be computed, the computation involves costly numerical\ndifferentiation. In this work, we add a novel fuzzy logic filter in the\ncounting of visible frontier voxels surrounding a viewpoint, which allows the\ngradient of the information gain with respect to the viewpoint to be\nefficiently computed using automatic differentiation.

At early times,\nan intense and fast starburst forms blue and disk-dominated galaxies. After\nquenching, the remaining structures become red, compact and massive, i.e., 'red\nnuggets'. Then, a time-extended second phase which is dominated by mergers,\ncauses structural evolution and size growth. Given the stochastic nature of\nmergers, a small fraction of red nuggets survives, without any interaction,\nmassive and compact until today: relic galaxies. Since this fraction depends on\nthe processes dominating the size growth, counting relics at low-z is a\nvaluable way to disentangle between different galaxy evolution models.

Current approaches to predicting\ncomplex structures typically consider autoregressive models for their\ntractability, with some sacrifice in flexibility. Energy-based models (EBMs) on\nthe other hand offer a more flexible and thus more powerful approach to\nmodeling such distributions, but require partition function estimation. In this\npaper we propose ALOE, a new algorithm for learning conditional and\nunconditional EBMs for discrete structured data, where parameter gradients are\nestimated using a learned sampler that mimics local search. We show that the\nenergy function and sampler can be trained efficiently via a new variational\nform of power iteration, achieving a better trade-off between flexibility and\ntractability. Experimentally, we show that learning local search leads to\nsignificant improvements in challenging application domains. Most notably, we\npresent an energy model guided fuzzer for software testing that achieves\ncomparable performance to well engineered fuzzing engines like libfuzzer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 19:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

The brane is parallel to the AdS boundary and the\ncosmic string is orthogonal to the brane. Two types of boundary conditions are\nconsidered on the brane that include the MIT bag boundary condition and the\nboundary conditions in Z2-symmetric braneworld models. The brane divides the\nspace into two regions with different properties of the vacuum state. The only\nnonzero component of the current density is along the azimuthal direction and\nin both the regions the corresponding VEV is decomposed into the brane-free and\nbrane-induced contributions. The latter vanishes on the string and near the\nstring the total current is dominated by the brane-free part. At large\ndistances from the string and in the region between the brane and AdS horizon\nthe decay of the brane-induced current density, as a function of the proper\ndistance, is power-law for both massless and massive fields. For a massive\nfield this behavior is essentially different from that in the Minkowski bulk.\nIn the region between the brane and AdS boundary the large-distance decay of\nthe current density is exponential. Depending on the boundary condition on the\nbrane, the brane-induced contribution is dominant or subdominant in the total\ncurrent density at large distances from the string. By using the results for\nfields realizing two inequivalent irreducible representations of the Clifford\nalgebra, the vacuum current density is investigated in C- and P-symmetric\nfermionic models. Applications are given for a cosmic string in the\nRandall-Sundrum-type braneworld model with a single brane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 19:36:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 16:40:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 15:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

On the other hand, the covariance steering problem seeks for a\ncontrol policy that will steer the covariance of the terminal state to a\nprescribed positive definite matrix. We propose a solution approach that relies\non the stochastic version of the affine disturbance feedback control\nparametrization according to which the control input at each stage can be\nexpressed as an affine function of the history of disturbances that have acted\nupon the system. Our analysis reveals that this particular parametrization\nallows one to reduce the stochastic optimal control problems considered herein\ninto tractable convex programs with essentially the same decision variables.\nThis is in contrast with other control policy parametrizations, such as the\nstate feedback parametrization, in which the decision variables of the convex\nprogram do not coincide with the controller's parameters of the stochastic\noptimal control problem.

Recent progress in autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has\nfurther increased the potential impact of aerial cameras, with systems that can\nsafely track actors in unstructured cluttered environments. Professional\nproductions, however, require the use of multiple cameras simultaneously to\nrecord different viewpoints of the same scene, which are edited into the final\nfootage either in real time or in post-production. Such extreme motion\ncoordination is particularly hard for unscripted action scenes, which are a\ncommon use case of aerial cameras. In this work we develop a real-time\nmulti-UAV coordination system that is capable of recording dynamic targets\nwhile maximizing shot diversity and avoiding collisions and mutual visibility\nbetween cameras. We validate our approach in multiple cluttered environments of\na photo-realistic simulator, and deploy the system using two UAVs in real-world\nexperiments. We show that our coordination scheme has low computational cost\nand takes only 1.17 ms on average to plan for a team of 3 UAVs over a 10 s time\nhorizon.

Despite\ntheir new appeal, the success of NMNs hinges on the ability of the\ngradient-based optimiser to perform incremental training of the NMN\ncontrollers, determining how to leverage their high capacity for knowledge\nretrieval. This means that while excellent performance can be achieved when the\ntraining data is consistent and well distributed, rare data samples are hard to\nlearn from as the controllers fail to incorporate them effectively during model\ntraining. Drawing inspiration from the human cognition process, in particular\nthe utilisation of neuromodulators in the human brain, we propose to decouple\nthe learning process of the NMN controllers to allow them to achieve flexible,\nrapid adaptation in the presence of new information. This trait is highly\nbeneficial for meta-learning tasks where the memory controllers must quickly\ngrasp abstract concepts in the target domain, and adapt stored knowledge. This\nallows the NMN controllers to quickly determine which memories are to be\nretained and which are to be erased, and swiftly adapt their strategy to the\nnew task at hand. Through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on\nmultiple public benchmarks, including classification and regression tasks, we\ndemonstrate the utility of the proposed approach. Our evaluations not only\nhighlight the ability of the proposed NMN architecture to outperform the\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods, but also provide insights on how the proposed\naugmentations help achieve such superior results. In addition, we demonstrate\nthe practical implications of the proposed learning strategy, where the\nfeedback path can be shared among multiple neural memory networks as a\nmechanism for knowledge sharing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 22:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

This pattern has overwhelmed the emergency services with limited\nresources and demands the optimization of response processes. It is partly due\nto traditional `reactive' approach of emergency services to collect data about\nincidents, where a source initiates a call to the emergency number (e.g., 911\nin U.S.), delaying and limiting the potentially optimal response. Crowdsourcing\nplatforms such as Waze provides an opportunity to develop a rapid, `proactive'\napproach to collect data about incidents through crowd-generated observational\nreports. However, the reliability of reporting sources and spatio-temporal\nuncertainty of the reported incidents challenge the design of such a proactive\napproach. Thus, this paper presents a novel method for emergency incident\ndetection using noisy crowdsourced Waze data.

The first generation of networks is trained on the relevant\nsequences in human speech from TIMIT. The subsequent generations are not\ntrained on TIMIT, but on generated outputs from the previous generation and\nthus start learning from each other in an iterative learning task. The initial\nallophonic distribution is progressively being lost with each generation,\nlikely due to pressures from the global distribution of aspiration in the\ntraining data.

In these method, the high resolution input image is\ndown-scaled to low resolution space using a single filter, commonly\nmax-pooling, before feature extraction. This means that the feature extraction\nis performed in biased filtered feature space. We demonstrate that this is\nsub-optimal and causes information loss. In this work, we proposed a\nstate-of-the-art convolutional neural network method called Dense U-net with\nshuffle pooling. To achieve this, a modified U-net with dense blocks, called\ndense U-net, is proposed for SISR. Then, a new pooling strategy called shuffle\npooling is designed, which is aimed to replace the dense U-Net for down-scale\noperation. By doing so, we effectively replace the handcrafted filter in the\nSISR pipeline with more lossy down-sampling filters specifically trained for\neach feature map, whilst also reducing the information loss of the overall SISR\noperation.

In PCMs,\nthe primary mechanism for data storage is thermal excitation. However, there is\na limited body of research regarding the thermal properties of PCMs at length\nscales close to the memory cell dimension and, thus, the impact of interfaces\non PCM operation is unknown. Our work presents a new paradigm to manage thermal\ntransport in memory cells by manipulating the interfacial thermal resistance\nbetween the phase change unit and the electrodes without incorporating\nadditional insulating layers. Experimental measurements show a substantial\nchange in thermal boundary resistance as GST transitions from one\ncrystallographic structure (cubic) to another (hexagonal) and as the thickness\nof tungsten contacts is reduced from five to two nanometers. Simulations reveal\nthat interfacial resistance between the phase change unit and its adjacent\nlayer can reduce the reset current for 20 and 120 nm diameter devices by up to\n~40% and ~50%, respectively. The resultant phase-dependent and geometric\neffects on thermal boundary resistance dictate that the effective thermal\nconductivity of the phase change unit can be reduced by a factor of four,\npresenting a new opportunity to reduce operating currents in PCMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 01:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-05"}

In this paper, a theory presented for explain\nmechanism of ICD induction from near field interaction of chiral molecule with\nachiral nanostructure. By introducing dipole approaching of chiral molecule and\na near field approximation of molecule-nanostructure interaction, we derived an\nanalytical formula for ICD. This theory explains mechanism of ICD is that the\ndipole radiation of chiral molecules breaks the enantiomorphic relationship of\nthe electric field strengths in the nanostructure. Furthermore, the derived\nformula exhibits ICD proportional to molecules chirality parameter and number\ndensity, and it exponentially increases with the inverse cube of distance\nbetween molecule and nanostructure. Most importantly, the formula shows that\nICD is proportional to strengths of electric field in nanostructure and\nmagnetic field in molecular region. To verify the analytical results, we\nstudied the ICD properties of graphene nanohole metasurface (GNM) and chiral\nmolecule composed system.

The development of a Monte Carlo\nsimulation for the polarized radiative transfer is detailed: it employs an\nelectric field vector formalism to enable a breadth of utility in relating\nlinear, circular and elliptical polarizations. The simulation can be applied to\nany neutron star surface locale, and is adaptable to accretion column and\nmagnetospheric problems.

The assumption of our proposed method is that defects have a\nstable life cycle in terms of the proportion of the number of versions affected\nby the defects before discovering and fixing these defects. Results related to\n212 open-source projects from the Apache ecosystem, featuring a total of about\n125,000 defects, reveal that the realistic method cannot be used in the\nmajority (51%) of defects. Therefore, it is important to develop automated\nmethods to retrieve AVs. Results related to 76 open-source projects from the\nApache ecosystem, featuring a total of about 6,250,000 classes, affected by\n60,000 defects, and spread over 4,000 versions and 760,000 commits, reveal that\nthe proportion of the number of versions between defect discovery and fix is\npretty stable (STDV < 2) across the defects of the same project. Moreover, the\nproposed method resulted significantly more accurate than all three SZZ\nimplementations in (i) retrieving AVs, (ii) labeling classes as defective, and\n(iii) in developing defects repositories to perform feature selection. Thus,\nwhen the realistic method is unusable, the proposed method is a valid automated\nalternative to SZZ for retrieving the origin of a defect.

Although there is a large stream of\nliterature on ride-hailing demand predictions for one specific service mode,\nlittle efforts have been paid towards joint predictions of ride-hailing demands\nfor multiple service modes. To address this issue, we propose a deep multi-task\nmulti-graph learning approach, which combines two components: (1) multiple\nmulti-graph convolutional (MGC) networks for predicting demands for different\nservice modes, and (2) multi-task learning modules that enable knowledge\nsharing across multiple MGC networks.

The first one is the regularized\ncross-task learning, which builds cross-task connections among the inputs and\noutputs of multiple MGC networks. The second one is the multi-linear\nrelationship learning, which imposes a prior tensor normal distribution on the\nweights of various MGC networks. Although there are no concrete bridges between\ndifferent MGC networks, the weights of these networks are constrained by each\nother and subject to a common prior distribution.

However, differences between the\nsimulator and the real world often cause the model to perform poorly in the\nreal world. Domain randomization is a way to bridge the sim-to-real gap by\nexposing the model to a wide range of scenarios so that it can generalize to\nreal-world situations. However, following domain randomization to train an\nautonomous car racing model with DRL can lead to undesirable outcomes. Namely,\na model trained with randomization tends to run slower; a higher completion\nrate on the testing track comes at the expense of longer lap times. This paper\naims to boost the robustness of a trained race car model without compromising\nracing lap times. For a training track and a testing track having the same\nshape (and same optimal paths), but with different lighting, background, etc.,\nwe first train a model (teacher model) that overfits the training track, moving\nalong a near optimal path.

While spin dynamics at zero\nmagnetic field can be probed indirectly, J-spectra can also be measured at zero\nfield by using non-inductive sensors, for example, optically-pumped\nmagnetometers (OPMs). A J-spectrum can be detected when a molecule contains at\nleast two different types of magnetic nuclei (i.e., nuclei with different\ngyromagnetic ratios) that are coupled via J-coupling. Up to date, no pure\nJ-spectra of molecules featuring the coupling to quadrupolar nuclei were\nreported.

In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can automatically learn\nimplicit nonlinear interactions from original sparse features, and therefore\nhave been widely used in industrial CTR prediction tasks. However, the implicit\nfeature interactions learned in DNNs cannot fully retain the complete\nrepresentation capacity of the original and empirical feature interactions\n(e.g., cartesian product) without loss. For example, a simple attempt to learn\nthe combination of feature A and feature B <A, B> as the explicit cartesian\nproduct representation of new features can outperform previous implicit feature\ninteraction models including factorization machine (FM)-based models and their\nvariations. In this paper, we propose a Co-Action Network (CAN) to approximate\nthe explicit pairwise feature interactions without introducing too many\nadditional parameters. More specifically, giving feature A and its associated\nfeature B, their feature interaction is modeled by learning two sets of\nparameters: 1) the embedding of feature A, and 2) a Multi-Layer Perceptron\n(MLP) to represent feature B. The approximated feature interaction can be\nobtained by passing the embedding of feature A through the MLP network of\nfeature B. We refer to such pairwise feature interaction as feature co-action,\nand such a Co-Action Network unit can provide a very powerful capacity to\nfitting complex feature interactions.

With strong photon-magnon\ninteraction and strong driving on magnon, an effective Hamiltonian is\nconstructed to describe the conversion between photons and phonons nearby their\nresonant point. The cavity-magnon system can then play the role of a quantum\nmemory. Moreover, the faithfulness of the photon-phonon conversion is estimated\nin terms of fidelities for state evolution and state-independent transfer.

However, most existing studies on flight delay modeling do\nnot consider en-route congestion explicitly. In this study, we propose a new\nflight delay model, Multi-layer Air Traffic Network Delay (MATND) model, to\ncapture the impact of en-route congestion on flight delays over an air traffic\nnetwork. This model is developed by a data-driven approach, taking aircraft\ntracking data and flight schedules as inputs to characterize a national air\ntraffic network, as well as a system-level model approach, modeling the delay\nprocess based on queueing theory. The two approaches combined make the network\ndelay model a close representation of reality and easy-to-implement for what-if\nscenario analysis. The proposed MATND model includes 1) a data-driven method to\nlearn a network composed of airports, en-route congestion points, and air\ncorridors from aircraft tracking data, 2) a stochastic and dynamic queuing\nnetwork model to calculate flight delays and track their propagation at both\nairports and in en-route congestion areas, in which the delays are computed via\na space-time decomposition method. Using one month of historical aircraft\ntracking data over China's air traffic network, MATND is tested and shows to\ngive an accurate quantification of delays of the national air traffic network.\n\"What-if\" scenario analyses are conducted to demonstrate how the proposed model\ncan be used for the evaluation of air traffic network improvement strategies,\nwhere the manipulation of reality at such a scale is impossible. Results show\nthat MATND is computationally efficient, well suited for evaluating the impact\nof policy alternatives on system-wide delay at a macroscopic level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 09:13:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 11:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

Previous studies\nhighlighted the remarkable association of such features to tracers of the\nmagnetized-neutral ISM, as interstellar dust and atomic hydrogen (HI). However,\nthe physical conditions responsible for the correlation between magneto-ionic\nand neutral media are yet to be clarified.

The observed HOG correlation in Fields\n3C196 and A is associated with all HI phases and it is surprisingly dominant in\nthe CNM and LNM phases.

Therefore, making full use of the available unlabeled data can\nbe a potential way to further improve the performance of current image\nclassification methods. In this paper, we propose a discriminative\nsemi-supervised sparse representation algorithm for image classification. In\nthe algorithm, the classification process is combined with the sparse coding to\nlearn a data-driven linear classifier.

Unlike periodic\ncrystals, quasicrystals lack translational symmetry but are unrestricted in\nrotational symmetries, which leads to largely unexplored mechanical and dynamic\nproperties. We investigate a family of continuous elastic quasicrystals with\ndifferent rotational symmetry orders that are directly enforced through a\ndesign procedure in reciprocal space. Their mechanical properties are\ninvestigated as a function of symmetry order and filling fraction. Results\nindicate that higher order symmetries, such as 8-, 10- and 14-fold, allow for\nhigh equivalent stiffness characteristics that interpolate those of the\nconstituent material while maintaining high levels of isotropy for all filling\nfractions. Thus, quasiperiodic composites exhibit more uniform strain energy\ndistributions when compared to periodic hexagonal configurations. Similarly,\nnearly-isotropic wave propagation is observed over a broader range of\nfrequencies. Spectral contents are also investigated by enforcing rotational\nsymmetry constraints in a wedge-type unit cell, which allows for the estimation\nof band gaps that are confirmed in frequency response computations.

The current deep learning based HSI\nclassifiers follow a patch-based learning framework by dividing the image into\noverlapping patches. As such, these methods are local learning methods, which\nhave a high computational cost. In this paper, a fast patch-free global\nlearning (FPGA) framework is proposed for HSI classification. In FPGA, an\nencoder-decoder based FCN is utilized to consider the global spatial\ninformation by processing the whole image, which results in fast inference.\nHowever, it is difficult to directly utilize the encoder-decoder based FCN for\nHSI classification as it always fails to converge due to the insufficiently\ndiverse gradients caused by the limited training samples. To solve the\ndivergence problem and maintain the abilities of FCN of fast inference and\nglobal spatial information mining, a global stochastic stratified sampling\nstrategy is first proposed by transforming all the training samples into a\nstochastic sequence of stratified samples. This strategy can obtain diverse\ngradients to guarantee the convergence of the FCN in the FPGA framework. For a\nbetter design of FCN architecture, FreeNet, which is a fully end-to-end network\nfor HSI classification, is proposed to maximize the exploitation of the global\nspatial information and boost the performance via a spectral attention based\nencoder and a lightweight decoder. A lateral connection module is also designed\nto connect the encoder and decoder, fusing the spatial details in the encoder\nand the semantic features in the decoder. The experimental results obtained\nusing three public benchmark datasets suggest that the FPGA framework is\nsuperior to the patch-based framework in both speed and accuracy for HSI\nclassification.

To efficiently stream high-quality\nlive video content to a large amount of offices, companies employ distributed\nvideo streaming solutions which rely on prior knowledge of the underlying\nevolving enterprise network. However, such networks are highly complex and\ndynamic. Hence, to optimally coordinate the live video distribution, the\navailable network capacity between viewers has to be accurately predicted. In\nthis paper we propose a graph representation learning technique on weighted and\ndynamic graphs to predict the network capacity, that is the weights of\nconnections/links between viewers/nodes. We propose VStreamDRLS, a graph neural\nnetwork architecture with a self-attention mechanism to capture the evolution\nof the graph structure of live video streaming events. VStreamDRLS employs the\ngraph convolutional network (GCN) model over the duration of a live video\nstreaming event and introduces a self-attention mechanism to evolve the GCN\nparameters. In doing so, our model focuses on the GCN weights that are relevant\nto the evolution of the graph and generate the node representation,\naccordingly. We evaluate our proposed approach on the link prediction task on\ntwo real-world datasets, generated by enterprise live video streaming events.\nThe duration of each event lasted an hour.

The objective is to minimize the sum of the\nweighted flow times of the jobs, where the flow time of a job is the time\nbetween its release date and its completion time.\n  It had been a long-standing open problem to find a polynomial time\n$O(1)$-approximation algorithm for this setting.

The sFFT algorithms\ndecrease the runtime and sampling complexity by taking advantage of the signal\ninherent characteristics that a large number of signals are sparse in the\nfrequency domain(e.g., sensors, video data, audio, medical image, etc.). The\nfirst stage of sFFT is frequency bucketization through one of these filters:\nDirichlet kernel filter, flat filter, aliasing filter, etc. Compared to other\nsFFT algorithms, the sFFT algorithms using the flat filter is more convenient\nand efficient because the filtered signal is concentrated both in the time\ndomain and frequency domain.

Despite many decades of\ninvestigation, the large order behavior of the SHE coefficients, and the\nprecise domain of convergence for these expansions, have remained open\nquestions. These questions are settled in the present paper for generic\nplanets, whose shape (topography) may include many local peaks, but just one\nglobally highest peak. We show that regardless of the smoothness of the density\nand topography, short of outright analyticity, the spherical harmonic expansion\nof the gravitational potential converges exactly in the closure of the exterior\nof the Brillouin sphere (The smallest sphere around the center of mass of the\nplanet containing the planet in its interior), and convergence below the\nBrillouin sphere occurs with probability zero. More precisely, such\nover-convergence occurs on zero measure sets in the space of parameters. A\nrelated result is that, in a natural Banach space, SHE convergence of the\npotential below the Brillouin sphere occurs for potential functions in a\nsubspace of infinite codimension (while any positive codimension already\nimplies occurrence of probability zero). Provided a certain limit in Fourier\nspace exists, we find the leading order asymptotic behavior of the coefficients\nof SHEs.\n  We go further by finding a necessary and sufficient condition for convergence\nbelow the Brillouin sphere, which requires a form of analyticity at the highest\npeak, which would not hold for a realistic celestial body.

They allow to break down large systems into smaller\ncomponents, while enabling reasoning about the behaviour of the composed\nsystem. For concurrent and communicating systems, compositional techniques\nbased on behavioural type systems have received much attention. By abstracting\ncommunication protocols as types, these type systems can statically check that\nprograms interact with channels according to a certain protocol, whether the\nintended messages are exchanged in a certain order. In this paper, we put on\nour coalgebraic spectacles to investigate session types, a widely studied class\nof behavioural type systems. We provide a syntax-free description of\nsession-based concurrency as states of coalgebras. As a result, we rediscover\ntype equivalence, duality, and subtyping relations in terms of canonical\ncoinductive presentations. In turn, this coinductive presentation makes it\npossible to elegantly derive a decidable type system with subtyping for\n$\\pi$-calculus processes, in which the states of a coalgebra will serve as\nchannel protocols. Going full circle, we exhibit a coalgebra structure on an\nexisting session type system, and show that the relations and type system\nresulting from our coalgebraic perspective agree with the existing ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 11:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

We assess the veracity of these\nimplementations on the effective gravitational constant ($\\mu$) and the slip\nparameter ($\\eta$), within the framework of Horndeski models. In particular,\nfor a set of models we compare cosmological observables, i.e., the matter power\nspectrum and the CMB temperature and lensing angular power spectra, computed\nusing the QSA, with exact numerical solutions. To do that, we use a newly\ndeveloped branch of the CLASS code: QSA_class. All three approaches agree\nexactly on very small scales.

In a hard wall treatment based on the 4\nx 4 BHZ Hamiltonian and open boundary conditions (OBCs), the wave function is\nweakly confined near the edge, with which it makes no contact. In contrast,\nstandard boundary conditions for the wave function and its derivative (SBCs)\nlead to strong confinement with a peak amplitude at the edge. Unfortunately,\nweak confinement exhibits unphysical behavior related to a spurious gap\nsolution that is included in the OBC wave function. This is confirmed by the\ngap solutions of the parent multiband Hamiltonian from which the smaller\nHamiltonian is derived, which exhibit physical behavior and do not satisfy\nOBCs. Unlike OBCs or other approaches based on phenomenological boundary\nconditions, SBCs treat the wall explicitly. Using a basis of empty crystal free\nelectron states for the vacuum with the same symmetry as the TI states, it is\nshown that a large wall band gap overlapping that of the TI can only be\nachieved by including a thin passivation layer. For passivation materials such\nas silicon dioxide where the mid gap energy is nearly degenerate with that of\nthe TI, the Dirac point is very close to mid gap and virtually independent of\nthe TI band asymmetry. The treatment also demonstrates that a significant shift\nof the dispersion may be introduced by interface band mixing.

Despite providing a more accurate\nrepresentation of the face, 3D facial images are more complex to acquire than\n2D pictures. As a consequence, great effort has been invested in developing\nsystems that reconstruct 3D faces from an uncalibrated 2D image. However, the\n3D-from-2D face reconstruction problem is ill-posed, thus prior knowledge is\nneeded to restrict the solutions space. In this work, we review 3D face\nreconstruction methods proposed in the last decade, focusing on those that only\nuse 2D pictures captured under uncontrolled conditions. We present a\nclassification of the proposed methods based on the technique used to add prior\nknowledge, considering three main strategies, namely, statistical model\nfitting, photometry, and deep learning, and reviewing each of them separately.\nIn addition, given the relevance of statistical 3D facial models as prior\nknowledge, we explain the construction procedure and provide a list of the most\npopular publicly available 3D facial models. After the exhaustive study of\n3D-from-2D face reconstruction approaches, we observe that the deep learning\nstrategy is rapidly growing since the last few years, becoming the standard\nchoice in replacement of the widespread statistical model fitting.

There are mainly two\nstages in the sFFT: frequency bucketization and spectrum reconstruction.\nFrequency bucketization is equivalent to hashing the frequency coefficients\ninto B buckets through one of these filters: Dirichlet kernel filter, flat\nfilter, aliasing filter, etc. The spectrum reconstruction is equivalent to\nidentifying frequencies that are isolated in their buckets. More than forty\ndifferent sFFT algorithms compute Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT) by their\nunique methods so far. In order to use them properly, the urgent topic of great\nconcern is how to analyze and evaluate the performance of these algorithms in\ntheory and practice. The paper mainly discusses the sFFT Algorithms using the\naliasing filter. In the first part, the paper introduces the technique of three\nframeworks: the one-shot framework based on the compressed sensing(CS) solver,\nthe peeling framework based on the bipartite graph and the iterative framework\nbased on the binary tree search. Then, we get the conclusion of the performance\nof six corresponding algorithms: sFFT-DT1.0, sFFT-DT2.0, sFFT-DT3.0, FFAST,\nR-FFAST and DSFFT algorithm in theory. In the second part, we make two\ncategories of experiments for computing the signals of different SNR, different\nN, different K by a standard testing platform and record the run time,\npercentage of the signal sampled and L0, L1, L2 error both in the exactly\nsparse case and general sparse case. The result of experiments satisfies the\ninferences obtained in theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 13:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

Given the large\namount of planetesimals that potentially form at gap edges, we address the\nquestion of their fate and ability to radially transport solids in\nprotoplanetary discs. We perform a series of N-body simulations of planetesimal\norbits, taking into account the effect of gas drag and mass loss via ablation.\nWe consider two planetary systems: one akin to the young Solar System, and\nanother one inspired by HL Tau. In both systems, the close proximity to the\ngap-opening planets results in large orbital excitations, causing the\nplanetesimals to leave their birth locations and spread out across the disc\nsoon after formation.

Blackbody emission\nfrom the photosphere is the direct observational signature of the wind. Here we\ninvestigate whether or not it can explain the soft emission component seen in\nthe energy spectra of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). Based on high-quality\nXMM-Newton spectra of 15 ULXs, we find that the soft component can be modeled\nas blackbody emission with a nearly constant luminosity, and the 5 known\npulsating ULXs (PULXs) in the sample display a blackbody luminosity among the\nlowest. These are consistent with the scenario that the soft emission\noriginates from the photosphere of the optically thick wind. However, the\nderived blackbody luminosity for PULXs is significantly above the Eddington\nlimit for neutron stars. A possible explanation is that a considerable fraction\nof the optically thick wind roots in the inner accretion flow, where the\nradiative flux could exceed the Eddington limit due to a reduced scattering\ncross-section or enhanced radiation transfer with magnetic buoyancy. Based on a\nwind model, the inferred mass accretion rate in these standard ULXs overlaps\nbut is on average lower than that in luminous and very soft X-ray sources,\nwhich are also candidates with supercritical accretion. Alternatively, it\ncannot be ruled out that the soft emission component is a result of the hard\ncomponent, e.g., via down-scattering in a cool medium, as a weak correlation\nmay exist between them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 13:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

Due to the uncertainty in the distortion variation, restoring\ndistorted images caused by liquify filter is a challenging task. To edit images\nin an efficient way, distorted images are expected to be restored\nautomatically. This paper aims at the distorted image restoration, which is\ncharacterized by seeking the appropriate warping and completion of a distorted\nimage. Existing methods focus on the hardware assistance or the geometric\nprinciple to solve the specific regular deformation caused by natural\nphenomena, but they cannot handle the irregularity and uncertainty of\nartificial distortion in this task. To address this issue, we propose a novel\ngenerative and discriminative learning method based on deep neural networks,\nwhich can learn various reconstruction mappings and represent complex and\nhigh-dimensional data.

In addition to the possibility of entangling photons in\nthese many degrees of freedom, it makes light a very useful and versatile tool\nfor quantum information and quantum foundation purposes. In this thesis, we\nendorse its importance and versatility by presenting novel contributions that\nfurther explore both discrete and continuous degrees of freedom. It begins with\ntwo experiments that use classical light and explore its analogous behavior to\nquantum systems. The first one is a classical optics simulation of the dynamics\nof a relativistic quantum particle. The second work is related to the theory of\nmutually unbiased measurements that are effectively discrete but constructed\nfrom continuous variables systems. In the second part of the thesis, three\nworks are presented that use the polarization and path discrete degrees of\nfreedom. The first one is a redefinition of the quantum nonlocal correlation\ncalled steering in the multipartite scenario, based on an inconsistency in the\nprevious definition, namely the creation of this correlation from scratch using\noperations that supposedly would not be able to do so. We call this exposure of\nquantum steering. Steering exposure is observed with entangled photons.

Recently, there has been much interest in the\nintegration of persistent homology as a computational step in neural networks\nor deep learning. In order for a given computation to be integrated in such a\nway, the computation in question must be differentiable. Computing the\ngradients of persistent homology is an ill-posed inverse problem with\ninfinitely many solutions. Consequently, it is important to perform\nregularization so that the solution obtained agrees with known priors. In this\nwork we propose a novel method for regularizing persistent homology gradient\ncomputation through the addition of a grouping term.

More economical\nflexibility options such as demand response and sector coupling might reduce\nthe market size for storage facilities. This paper assesses the economic\nperformance of community electricity storage systems by taking competitive\nflexibility options into account. For this purpose, an actor-related,\nscenario-based optimization framework is applied. The results are in line with\nthe literature and show that community storage systems are economically more\nefficient than household storage systems. Relative storage capacity reductions\nof community storage systems over household storage systems are possible, as\nthe demand and generation profiles are balanced out among end users. On\naverage, storage capacity reductions of 9% per household are possible in the\nbase case, resulting in lower specific investments. The simultaneous\napplication of demand-side flexibility options such as sector coupling and\ndemand response enable a further capacity reduction of the community storage\nsize by up to 23%. At the same time, the competition between flexibility\noptions leads to smaller benefits regarding the community storage flexibility\npotential, which reduces the market viability for these applications. In the\nworst case, the cannibalization effects reach up to 38% between the flexibility\nmeasures. The losses of the flexibility benefits outweigh the savings of the\ncapacity reduction whereby sector coupling constitutes a far greater\ninfluencing factor than demand response. Overall, in consideration of the\nstated cost trends, the economies of scale, and the reduction possibilities, a\nprofitable community storage model might be reached between 2025 and 2035.\nFuture work should focus on the analysis of policy frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 14:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

The (global) state reachability problem for DCPS\nis undecidable in general, but Atig et al. (2009) showed that it becomes\ndecidable, and is in 2EXPSPACE, when each thread is restricted to a fixed\nnumber of context switches. The best known lower bound for the problem is\nEXPSPACE-hard and this lower bound follows already when each thread is a\nfinite-state machine and runs atomically to completion (i.e., does not switch\ncontexts). In this paper, we close the gap by showing that state reachability\nis 2EXPSPACE-hard already with only one context switch. Interestingly, state\nreachability analysis is in EXPSPACE both for pushdown threads without context\nswitches as well as for finite-state threads with arbitrary context switches.\nThus, recursive threads together with a single context switch provide an\nexponential advantage.\n  Our proof techniques are of independent interest for 2EXPSPACE-hardness\nresults. We introduce transducer-defined Petri nets, a succinct representation\nfor Petri nets, and show coverability is 2EXPSPACE-hard for this model. To show\n2EXPSPACE-hardness, we present a modified version of Lipton's simulation of\ncounter machines by Petri nets, where the net programs can make explicit\nrecursive procedure calls up to a bounded depth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 14:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-19"}

Many statistical\nand econometric methods, such as difference-in-differences, leverage repeated\nmeasurements and variation in timing to estimate policy effects, including in\nthe COVID-19 context. While these methods are less common in epidemiology,\nepidemiologic researchers are well accustomed to handling similar complexities\nin studies of individual-level interventions. \"Target trial emulation\"\nemphasizes the need to carefully design a non-experimental study in terms of\ninclusion and exclusion criteria, covariates, exposure definition, and outcome\nmeasurement -- and the timing of those variables. We argue that policy\nevaluations using group-level longitudinal (\"panel\") data need to take a\nsimilar careful approach to study design, which we refer to as \"policy trial\nemulation.\" This is especially important when intervention timing varies across\njurisdictions; the main idea is to construct target trials separately for each\n\"treatment cohort\" (states that implement the policy at the same time) and then\naggregate. We present a stylized analysis of the impact of state-level\nstay-at-home orders on total coronavirus cases. We argue that estimates from\npanel methods -- with the right data and careful modeling and diagnostics --\ncan help add to our understanding of many policies, though doing so is often\nchallenging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 14:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

These distances are defined via a\ngeneralization of Benamou Brenier formulation of the quadratic optimal\ntransport, based on a new weighted action functional and an abstract matricial\ncontinuity equation. It gives rise to a convex optimization problem. We shall\ngive a complete characterization of its minimizer (i.e., the geodesic) and\ndiscuss some topological and geometrical properties of these distances. Some\nrecently proposed models: the interpolation distance by Chen et al. [18] and\nthe Kantorovich Bures distance by Brenier et al. [11], as well as the well\nstudied Wasserstein Fisher Rao distance [43, 19, 40], fit in our model. The\nsecond part of this work is devoted to the numerical analysis of the fully\ndiscretization of the new transport model. We reinterpret the convergence\nframework proposed very recently by Lavenant [41] for the quadratic optimal\ntransport from the perspective of Lax equivalence theorem and extend it to our\ngeneral problem. In view of this abstract framework, we suggest a concrete\nfully discretized scheme inspired by the finite element theory, and show the\nunconditional convergence under mild assumptions. In particular, these\nassumptions are removed in the case of Wasserstein Fisher Rao distance due to\nthe existence of a static formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 15:26:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

Quantitative\nevaluation of self-organizing maps (SOM) is a subset of clustering validation,\nwhich is a challenging problem as such. Clustering model selection is typically\nachieved by using clustering validity indices. While they also apply to\nself-organized clustering models, they ignore the topology of the map, only\nanswering the question: do the SOM code vectors approximate well the data\ndistribution? Evaluating SOM models brings in the additional challenge of\nassessing their topology: does the mapping preserve neighborhood relationships\nbetween the map and the original data? The problem of assessing the performance\nof SOM models has already been tackled quite thoroughly in literature, giving\nbirth to a family of quality indices incorporating neighborhood constraints,\ncalled \\textit{topographic} indices. Commonly used examples of such metrics are\nthe topographic error, neighborhood preservation or the topographic product.\nHowever, open-source implementations are almost impossible to find.

This is done using\nthe latest technology of particle accelerators. The AGATA spectrometer consists\nof 180 high purity Germanium detectors. Each detector is segmented into 38\nsegments. The very harsh project requirements are to measure gamma ray energies\nwith very high resolution (< 1x 10 -3) at a high detector counting rate (50\nKevents / sec / crystal). This results in a very high data transfer rate per\ncrystal (5 to 8 Gbps). The 38 segments are sampled @ 100 MHz with 14 bits of\nresolution. The samples are continuously transferred to the CAP module which\nreduces the data rate from 64 Gbps to 5 Gbps. The CAP module also adds\ncontinuous monitoring data which results in total outgoing data rate of 10\nGbps. The STARE module is designed to fit between the CAP module and the\ncomputer farm.

This work explores improving human tissue imaging by\napplying deep learning to maximize image quality while reducing fluorescence\nexcitation exposure. We analyze two methods: a method based on U-Net, and a\npatch-based regression method. Both methods are evaluated on a skin dataset and\nan eye dataset.

However, the main drawback of existing deep\nlearning architectures is that they follow a fixed recommendation strategy,\nignoring users' real time-feedback. Recent advances of deep reinforcement\nstrategies showed that recommendation policies can be continuously updated\nwhile users interact with the system. In doing so, we can learn the optimal\npolicy that fits to users' preferences over the recommendation sessions. The\nmain drawback of deep reinforcement strategies is that are based on predefined\nand fixed neural architectures. To shed light on how to handle this issue, in\nthis study we first present deep reinforcement learning strategies for\nrecommendation and discuss the main limitations due to the fixed neural\narchitectures. Then, we detail how recent advances on progressive neural\narchitectures are used for consecutive tasks in other research domains.\nFinally, we present the key challenges to fill the gap between deep\nreinforcement learning and adaptive neural architectures. We provide guidelines\nfor searching for the best neural architecture based on each user feedback via\nreinforcement learning, while considering the prediction performance on\nreal-time recommendations and the model complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 09:43:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Automated lung\ninfections classification using chest X-ray (CXR) images could strengthen\ndiagnostic capability when handling COVID-19. However, classifying COVID-19\nfrom pneumonia cases using CXR image is a difficult task because of shared\nspatial characteristics, high feature variation and contrast diversity between\ncases. Moreover, massive data collection is impractical for a newly emerged\ndisease, which limited the performance of data thirsty deep learning models. To\naddress these challenges, Multiscale Attention Guided deep network with Soft\nDistance regularization (MAG-SD) is proposed to automatically classify COVID-19\nfrom pneumonia CXR images. In MAG-SD, MA-Net is used to produce prediction\nvector and attention from multiscale feature maps. To improve the robustness of\ntrained model and relieve the shortage of training data, attention guided\naugmentations along with a soft distance regularization are posed, which aims\nat generating meaningful augmentations and reduce noise. Our multiscale\nattention model achieves better classification performance on our pneumonia CXR\nimage dataset. Plentiful experiments are proposed for MAG-SD which demonstrates\nits unique advantage in pneumonia classification over cutting-edge models.

Though,\ndata acquisition and manual annotation in the HAR domain are prohibitively\nexpensive due to skilled human resource requirements in both steps. Hence,\ndomain adaptation techniques have been proposed to adapt the knowledge from the\nexisting source of data. More recently, adversarial transfer learning methods\nhave shown very promising results in image classification, yet limited for\nsensor-based HAR problems, which are still prone to the unfavorable effects of\nthe imbalanced distribution of samples. This paper presents a novel generic and\nrobust approach for semi-supervised domain adaptation in HAR, which capitalizes\non the advantages of the adversarial framework to tackle the shortcomings, by\nleveraging knowledge from annotated samples exclusively from the source subject\nand unlabeled ones of the target subject. Extensive subject translation\nexperiments are conducted on three large, middle, and small-size datasets with\ndifferent levels of imbalance to assess the robustness and effectiveness of the\nproposed model to the scale as well as imbalance in the data. The results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms over state-of-the-art\nmethods, which led in up to 13%, 4%, and 13% improvement of our high-level\nactivities recognition metrics for Opportunity, LISSI, and PAMAP2 datasets,\nrespectively. The LISSI dataset is the most challenging one owing to its less\npopulated and imbalanced distribution. Compared to the SA-GAN adversarial\ndomain adaptation method, the proposed approach enhances the final\nclassification performance with an average of 7.5% for the three datasets,\nwhich emphasizes the effectiveness of micro-mini-batch training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 12:16:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

The point clouds are represented as nonparametric\nfunctions in a reproducible kernel Hilbert space. The alignment problem is\nformulated as maximizing the inner product between two functions, essentially a\nsum of weighted kernels, each of which exploits the local geometric and\nsemantic features. As a result of the continuous models, analytical gradients\ncan be computed, and a local solution can be obtained by optimization over the\nrigid body transformation group. Besides, we present a new point cloud\nalignment metric that is intrinsic to the proposed framework and takes into\naccount geometric and semantic information.

To design NES, their working principle must be thoroughly understood.\nWe consider a particular type of NES, a small mass undergoing impacts and dry\nfriction within a cavity of a base structure (vibro-impact NES or impact\nabsorber). The nonlinear dynamic regimes under near-resonant forcing and\nresulting operating ranges are first revisited. We then investigate how\noff-resonant vibration modes and dissipation via impacts and dry friction\ncontribute to the vibration suppression.
