The axion couplings, to photon\n$g_{a\\gamma}$ and to electron $g_{ae}$ play important roles. These couplings\nare related to the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) charges $X_f$ for fermions. In most of the\ncalculations, $g_{a\\gamma}$ is obtained by normalizing to the ratio of\nelectromagnetic anomaly factor $E = TrX_f Q^2_f N_c$ ($N_c$ is 3 and 1 for\nquarks and charged leptons respectively) and QCD anomaly factor $N = TrX_q\nT(q)$ ($T(q)$ is quarks' $SU(3)_c$ index). The broken PQ symmetry generator is\nused in the calculation which does not seem to extract out the components of\nbroken generator in the axion which are \"eaten\" by the $Z$ boson. However,\nusing the physical components of axion or the ratio of anomaly factors should\nobtain the same results in the DFSZ for $g_{a\\gamma}$. When going beyond the\nstandard DFSZ models, such as variant DFSZ models, where more Higgs doublets\nand fermions have different PQ charges, one may wonder if the results are\ndifferent. We show that the two methods obtain the same results as expected,\nbut the axion couplings to quarks and leptons $g_{af}$ (here f indicates one of\nthe fermions in the SM) are more conveniently calculated in the physical axion\nbasis. The result depends on the values of the vacuum expectation values\nleading to a wider parameter space for $g_{af}$ in beyond the standard DFSZ\naxion. We also show explicitly how flavor conserving $g_{af}$ couplings can be\nmaintained when there are more than one Higgs doublets couple to the up and\ndown fermion sectors in variant DFSZ models at tree level, and how flavor\nviolating couplings can arise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 16:01:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 08:37:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 12:12:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 06:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

We show empirically that our algorithm produces a $k$-DPP sample\nafter observing only a small fraction of all elements, leading to several\norders of magnitude faster performance compared to the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 16:40:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

To test this\nhypothesis, we consider the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. We examine a\nsimple strategy for playing an MAB that can be implemented easily by a\nprobabilistic finite automaton (PFA).

Both\nlow and high field regimes of operation are explored at different temperatures,\ngate bias and stress cycles. During low field operation, current is found to\nsaturate after hundreds of seconds of operation with the current decay time\nconstant being a function of temperature and stress cycle. Current saturation\nafter several seconds during low field operation occurs when a thermal\nequilibrium is established. However, high field operation, especially at low\ntemperature, leads to impact ionization assisted material and device\ndegradation. It is found that high field operation at low temperature results\nin amorphization of the channel and is verified by device and Kelvin Probe\nForce Microscopy (KPFM) analyses. In general, a prolonged room temperature\noperation of CVD-grown MoS2 transistors lead to degraded gate control, higher\nOFF state current and negative shift in threshold voltage (VT). This is further\nverified, through micro-Raman and Photoluminescence spectroscopy, which suggest\nthat a steady state DC electrical stress leads to the formation of localized\nlow resistance regions in the channel and a subsequent loss of transistor\ncharacteristics.

A difficulty when creating models is that Performance Model\nParameters (PMPs, such as resource demands, loop iteration numbers and branch\nprobabilities) depend on various influencing factors like input data, used\nhardware and the applied workload. To enable a broad range of what-if\nquestions, Performance Models (PMs) need to have predictive power beyond what\nhas been measured to calibrate the models. Thus, PMPs need to be parametrized\nover the influencing factors that may vary.\n  Existing approaches allow for the estimation of parametrized PMPs by\nmeasuring the complete system. Thus, they are too costly to be applied\nfrequently, up to after each code change. They do not keep also manual changes\nto the model when recalibrating.\n  In this work, we present the Continuous Integration of Performance Models\n(CIPM), which incrementally extracts and calibrates the performance model,\nincluding parametric dependencies. CIPM responds to source code changes by\nupdating the PM and adaptively instrumenting the changed parts. To allow AbPP,\nCIPM estimates the parametrized PMPs using the measurements (generated by\nperformance tests or executing the system in production) and statistical\nanalysis, e.g., regression analysis and decision trees.\n  Additionally, our approach responds to production changes (e.g., load or\ndeployment changes) and calibrates the usage and deployment parts of PMs\naccordingly.\n  For the evaluation, we used two case studies.

In particular, PBH with sub-stellar masses could\nbe captured by stars, start to swallow their material, and eventually turn them\ninto BH, hence originating a peculiar new type of stellar catastrophic event.\nHere we revisit this process in the most favorable case of PBH capture by\nneutron stars. We detail a number of novel features in the capture phase,\nduring the settling within the star and mass growth of the PBH, and illustrate\nsome phenomenological consequences. In particular, we point out that in the\nsubsonic regime the PBH drag takes the form of a Bondi accretion. As a result,\nthe onset of the final transmutation of the NS into a stellar sized BH is\nexpected with the PBH seed in slight off-center position. We also compute the\ngravitational wave energy-loss and signals associated to different phases of\nthe PBH-stellar interaction. In particular, the emission associated to the\naccretion phase is periodic with a few kHz frequency; in the rare case of a\nnearby Galactic event and for light PBH, it could constitute a warning of the\nforthcoming transmutation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 17:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-08"}

With this\ninformation, future introductions can be anticipated and perhaps avoided. Point\nprocess models are commonly used for mapping species distribution and disease\noccurrence. If the time and location of introductions were known, then point\nprocess models could be used to map and understand the factors that influence\nintroductions; however, rarely is the process of introduction directly\nobserved. We propose embedding a point process within hierarchical Bayesian\nmodels commonly used to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of invasion.\nIncluding a point process within a hierarchical Bayesian model enables\ninference regarding the location and date of introduction from indirect\nobservation of the process such as species or disease occurrence records.

Due to the weakly collisional nature of the\nplasma, these regions are susceptible to the magneto-thermal instability (MTI),\nwhich can sustain turbulence and provide turbulent pressure support in the ICM.\nThis instability arises due to heat conduction directed along the magnetic\nfield, with a heat conductivity which is normally assumed to be given by the\nSpitzer value. Recent numerical studies of the ion mirror and the electron\nwhistler instability using particle-in-cell codes have shown that microscale\ninstabilities can lead to a reduced value for the heat conductivity in the ICM.\nThis could in turn influence the efficiency with which the MTI drives\nturbulence.

For some of these objects, observations point\nto very low-mass companions. In hydrodynamical CE simulations with the\nmoving-mesh code AREPO, we test whether low-mass objects can successfully\nunbind the envelope. The success of envelope removal in our simulations\ncritically depends on whether or not the ionization energy released by\nrecombination processes in the expanding material is taken into account. If\nthis energy is thermalized locally, envelope ejection eventually leading to the\nformation of an sdB star is possible with companion masses down to the brown\ndwarf range. For even lower companion masses approaching the regime of giant\nplanets, however, envelope removal becomes increasingly difficult or impossible\nto achieve. Our results are consistent with current observational constraints\non companion masses of sdB stars. Based on a semianalytic model, we suggest a\nnew criterion for the lowest companion mass that is capable of triggering a\ndynamical response of the primary star thus potentially facilitating the\nejection of a common envelope.

At the same\ntime, in most systems Poincar\\'e invariance is not a symmetry of the ground\nstate and is hence broken spontaneously. This phenomenon is ubiquitous in\ncosmology where Lorentz boosts are spontaneously broken by the existence of a\npreferred reference frame in which the universe is homogeneous and isotropic.\nThis motivates us to study scattering amplitudes without requiring invariance\nof the interactions under Lorentz boosts. In particular, using on-shell methods\nand assuming massless, relativistic and luminal particles of any spin, we show\nthat the allowed interactions around Minkowski spacetime are severely\nconstrained by unitarity and locality in the form of consistent factorization.\nThe existence of an interacting massless spin-2 particle enforces (analytically\ncontinued) three-particle amplitudes to be Lorentz invariant, even those that\ndo not involve a graviton, such as cubic scalar couplings. We conjecture this\nto be true for all n-particle amplitudes. Also, particles of spin S > 2 cannot\nself-interact nor can be minimally coupled to gravity, while particles of spin\nS > 1 cannot have electric charge. Given the growing evidence that free\ngravitons are well described by massless, luminal relativistic particles, our\nresults imply that cubic graviton interactions in Minkowski must be those of\ngeneral relativity up to a unique Lorentz-invariant higher-derivative\ncorrection of mass dimension 9.

In this paper, we review\nmodern signal processing frameworks generalizing GSP to multi-way data,\nstarting from graph signals coupled to familiar regular axes such as time in\nsensor networks, and then extending to general graphs across all tensor modes.\nThis widely applicable paradigm motivates reformulating and improving upon\nclassical problems and approaches to creatively address the challenges in\ntensor-based data.

This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive\nand negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the\nUnited States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into\nconsideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel\npattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and\nemotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people\nabout the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51\nstates including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic\ncharacteristics of the people, built environment data, and the number of\nCOVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to\nperform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors\nthat influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from\nthe logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education\nlevels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher\nhouse rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast,\nhouseholds with a high number of members and high income are less interested to\nreopen the economy.

We implemented the proposed framework and evaluated\nit using real vulnerabilities. The results show that Autosploit is able to\nautomatically identify the system properties that affect the ability to exploit\na vulnerability in both noiseless and noisy environments. These important\nresults can be utilized for more accurate and effective risk assessment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 18:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-02"}

However, the relationship\nbetween the dynamics of these brain regions, the connectivity between them, and\nthe ability to synchronize remains an open question. We investigated the\nproblem of inter-region synchronization in networks of Wilson-Cowan/Neural\nfield equations with homeostatic plasticity, each of which acts as a model for\nan isolated brain region. We considered arbitrary connection profiles with only\none constraint: the rows of the connection matrices are all identically\nnormalized. We found that these systems often synchronize to the solution\nobtained from a single, self-coupled neural region. We analyze the stability of\nthis solution through a straightforward modification of the Master Stability\nFunction (MSF) approach and found that synchronized solutions lose stability\nfor connectivity matrices when the second largest positive eigenvalue is\nsufficiently large, for values of the global coupling parameter that are not\ntoo large. This result was numerically confirmed for ring systems and lattices\nand was also robust to small amounts of heterogeneity in the homeostatic set\npoints in each node. Finally, we tested this result on connectomes obtained\nfrom 196 subjects over a broad age range (4-85 years) from the Human Connectome\nProject. We found that the second largest eigenvalue tended to decrease with\nage, indicating an increase in synchronizability that may be related to the\nincreased prevalence of epilepsy with old age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 19:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-02"}

For applications critically requiring\ninterpretation, attention-based GNNs have been leveraged. However, these\napproaches either rely on specific model architectures or lack a joint\nconsideration of graph structure and node features in their interpretation.\nHere we present a model-agnostic framework for interpreting important graph\nstructure and node features, Graph neural networks Including SparSe\ninTerpretability (GISST). With any GNN model, GISST combines an attention\nmechanism and sparsity regularization to yield an important subgraph and node\nfeature subset related to any graph-based task. Through a single self-attention\nlayer, a GISST model learns an importance probability for each node feature and\nedge in the input graph. By including these importance probabilities in the\nmodel loss function, the probabilities are optimized end-to-end and tied to the\ntask-specific performance. Furthermore, GISST sparsifies these importance\nprobabilities with entropy and L1 regularization to reduce noise in the input\ngraph topology and node features. Our GISST models achieve superior node\nfeature and edge explanation precision in synthetic datasets, as compared to\nalternative interpretation approaches. Moreover, our GISST models are able to\nidentify important graph structure in real-world datasets. We demonstrate in\ntheory that edge feature importance and multiple edge types can be considered\nby incorporating them into the GISST edge probability computation.

Materials and Methods: Raw data from the\nprostate DWI scans were retrospectively gathered (between July 2018 and July\n2019) from six single-vendor MRI scanners. 118 data sets were used for training\nand validation (age: 64.3 +- 8 years) and 37 - for testing (age: 65.1 +- 7.3\nyears). High b-value diffusion-weighted (hb-DW) data were reconstructed into\nnoisy images using two averages and reference images using all sixteen\naverages. A conventional DnCNN was modified into a guided DnCNN, which uses the\nlow b-value DWI image as a guidance input. Quantitative and qualitative reader\nevaluations were performed on the denoised hb-DW images. A cumulative link\nmixed regression model was used to compare the readers scores. The agreement\nbetween the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (denoised vs reference)\nwas analyzed using Bland Altman analysis. Results: Compared to the DnCNN, the\nguided DnCNN produced denoised hb-DW images with higher peak signal-to-noise\nratio and structural similarity index and lower normalized mean square error (p\n< 0.001). Compared to the reference images, the denoised images received higher\nimage quality scores (p < 0.0001). The ADC values based on the denoised hb-DW\nimages were in good agreement with the reference ADC values. Conclusion:\nAccelerating prostate DWI by reducing the number of acquired averages and\ndenoising the resulting image using the proposed guided DnCNN is technically\nfeasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 21:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-02"}

These protocols are very convenient for e.g.\nreal time data transmission. But when the reliability of the transmitted data\nis critical, other protocols termed as connection-oriented, allow for full\ncontrol of the data transmission process, assuring that the received data is an\nexact copy of the transmitted data, e.g. the case of the Transmission Control\nProtocol (TCP). To sustain the increased functionality and features of the\nconnection-oriented protocol, a set of mechanisms is implemented based on some\nspecific fields of the segment header. These mechanisms result in a significant\noverhead in terms of the increased number of transmitted packets. This may\nfurther translate into significant delays, because of the additional number of\nswitching and routing tasks, and eventually, because of more complex\ncommunications procedures, such as e.g. transmission window resizing, and of\ncourse, acknowledgement and sequence numbers updating. The two extremes of\nthese communication modalities, one that has no control at all, and the other\none that allows for full control, have resulted in the creation of an\nintermediate protocol that allows for a limited degree of knowledge on how\nsuccessful a transmission was, and even for an eventual reordering of the\nsegments that arrive out of sequence.

We prove that early learning and memorization are\nfundamental phenomena in high-dimensional classification tasks, even in simple\nlinear models, and give a theoretical explanation in this setting. Motivated by\nthese findings, we develop a new technique for noisy classification tasks,\nwhich exploits the progress of the early learning phase. In contrast with\nexisting approaches, which use the model output during early learning to detect\nthe examples with clean labels, and either ignore or attempt to correct the\nfalse labels, we take a different route and instead capitalize on early\nlearning via regularization. There are two key elements to our approach. First,\nwe leverage semi-supervised learning techniques to produce target probabilities\nbased on the model outputs.

In this paper we develop truncated spectrum methods (TSMs) for\nstudying the sinh-Gordon model at a finite volume as we vary the coupling\nconstant. We obtain the expected results for $b \\ll 1$ and intermediate values\nof $b$, but as the self-dual point $b=1$ is approached, the basic application\nof the TSM to the ShG breaks down. We find that the TSM gives results with a\nstrong cutoff $E_c$ dependence, which disappears according only to a very slow\npower law in $E_c$. Standard renormalization group strategies -- whether they\nbe numerical or analytic -- also fail to improve upon matters here. We thus\nexplore three strategies to address the basic limitations of the TSM in the\nvicinity of $b=1$. In the first, we focus on the small-volume spectrum. We\nattempt to understand how much of the physics of the ShG is encoded in the zero\nmode part of its Hamiltonian, in essence how `quantum mechanical' vs `quantum\nfield theoretic' the problem is. In the second, we identify the divergencies\npresent in perturbation theory and perform their resummation using a\nsupra-Borel approximate. In the third approach, we use the exact form factors\nof the model to treat the ShG at one value of $b$ as a perturbation of a ShG at\na different coupling. In the light of this work, we argue that the strong\ncoupling phase $b > 1$ of the Lagrangian formulation of model may be different\nfrom what is na\\\"ively inferred from its $S$-matrix.

Focus\nis placed on identifying the features impacting thermal conductivity that are\nlikely shared with other layered materials. The thermal conductivity $\\kappa$\nof graphite is found to be lower than that of graphene mainly due to changes in\nthe phonon dispersion driven by van der Waals coupling. Specifically, as the\natomic layers are brought closer together, the acoustic flexural phonons in\ngraphene form low-energy optical flexural phonons in graphite that possess\nlower in-plane velocities, density-of-states and phonon occupation, thus\nreducing $\\kappa$. Similar dispersion changes, and impact on thermal\nconductivity, can be expected in other van der Waals materials when\ntransitioning from 2D to 3D. Our findings also indicate that the selection\nrules in graphene, which reduce phonon-phonon scattering and contribute to its\nlarge $\\kappa$, effectively hold as the atomic layers are brought together to\nform graphite. While the selection rules do not strictly apply to graphite, in\npractice similar scattering behavior is displayed due in part to the weak\ninter-layer coupling.

In such near-accident scenarios, even a minor\nchange in the vehicle's actions may result in drastically different\nconsequences. To avoid unsafe actions in near-accident scenarios, we need to\nfully explore the environment. However, reinforcement learning (RL) and\nimitation learning (IL), two widely-used policy learning methods, cannot model\nrapid phase transitions and are not scalable to fully cover all the states. To\naddress driving in near-accident scenarios, we propose a hierarchical\nreinforcement and imitation learning (H-ReIL) approach that consists of\nlow-level policies learned by IL for discrete driving modes, and a high-level\npolicy learned by RL that switches between different driving modes.

Experimental results and user studies suggest our\napproach can achieve higher efficiency and safety compared to other methods.\nAnalyses of the policies demonstrate our high-level policy appropriately\nswitches between different low-level policies in near-accident driving\nsituations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 01:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-02"}

Conversational recommendation system\n(CRS) brings revolutions to those limitations by enabling the system to\ndirectly ask users about their preferred attributes on items. However, existing\nCRS methods do not make full use of such advantage -- they only use the\nattribute feedback in rather implicit ways such as updating the latent user\nrepresentation. In this paper, we propose Conversational Path Reasoning (CPR),\na generic framework that models conversational recommendation as an interactive\npath reasoning problem on a graph. It walks through the attribute vertices by\nfollowing user feedback, utilizing the user preferred attributes in an explicit\nway. By leveraging on the graph structure, CPR is able to prune off many\nirrelevant candidate attributes, leading to better chance of hitting user\npreferred attributes. To demonstrate how CPR works, we propose a simple yet\neffective instantiation named SCPR (Simple CPR). We perform empirical studies\non the multi-round conversational recommendation scenario, the most realistic\nCRS setting so far that considers multiple rounds of asking attributes and\nrecommending items.

For problems that have many\nunknown parameters and require many iterations, hybrid projection methods with\nrecycling can be used to compress and recycle the solution basis vectors to\nreduce the number of solution basis vectors that must be stored, while\nobtaining a solution accuracy that is comparable to that of standard methods.\nIf reorthogonalization is required, this may also reduce computational cost\nsubstantially.

Although the existing approaches\nhave achieved performance improvement, while practical, they still face the\nfollowing problems. On one hand, most existing HIN-based methods rely on\nexplicit path reachability to leverage path-based semantic relatedness between\nusers and items, e.g., metapath-based similarities. These methods are hard to\nuse and integrate since path connections are sparse or noisy, and are often of\ndifferent lengths. On the other hand, other graph-based methods aim to learn\neffective heterogeneous network representations by compressing node together\nwith its neighborhood information into single embedding before prediction. This\nweakly coupled manner in modeling overlooks the rich interactions among nodes,\nwhich introduces an early summarization issue. In this paper, we propose an\nend-to-end Neighborhood-based Interaction Model for Recommendation (NIRec) to\naddress the above problems. Specifically, we first analyze the significance of\nlearning interactions in HINs and then propose a novel formulation to capture\nthe interactive patterns between each pair of nodes through their\nmetapath-guided neighborhoods. Then, to explore complex interactions between\nmetapaths and deal with the learning complexity on large-scale networks, we\nformulate interaction in a convolutional way and learn efficiently with fast\nFourier transform. The extensive experiments on four different types of\nheterogeneous graphs demonstrate the performance gains of NIRec comparing with\nstate-of-the-arts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work\nproviding an efficient neighborhood-based interaction model in the HIN-based\nrecommendations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 04:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-02"}

Given a generative model with an undirected connected\ngraph $G$ and true vector of binary labels, it has been previously shown that\nwhen $G$ has good expansion properties, such as complete graphs or $d$-regular\nexpanders, one can exactly recover the true labels (with high probability and\nin polynomial time) from a single noisy observation of each edge and node.

To enhance the practical\nrelevance of the optimal dividend and reinsurance problem, non-cheap\nreinsurance is considered and transaction costs and taxes are imposed on\ndividends, which converts our optimization problem into a mixed\nclassical-impulse control problem. For the purpose of better mathematical\ntractability and neat, explicit solutions of our control problem, instead of\nthe Cram\\'er-Lundberg framework we study its approximated diffusion model with\ntwo thinly dependent classes of insurance businesses. Using a method of\nquasi-variational inequalities, we show that the optimal reinsurance follows a\ntwo-dimensional excess-of-loss reinsurance strategy, and, the optimal dividend\nstrategy turns out to be an impulse dividend strategy with an upper and a lower\nbarrier, i.e., every thing above the lower barrier is paid as dividends each\ntime the surplus is above the upper barrier, otherwise no dividends are paid.\nClosed-form expression for the value function associated with the optimal\ndividend and reinsurance strategy is also given.

In this work, we derive an\nunbiased estimator for general formulation of loss functions which decompose\nover labels, and then infer the forms for commonly used loss functions such as\nhinge- and squared-hinge-loss and binary cross-entropy loss.

Yet, Popper was emphatic in his rejection of inductive probability\nand of the logical probability of hypotheses; furthermore, for him, the degree\nof corroboration cannot be a probability. Instead he proposed a deductive\nmethod of testing. In many ways this dialectic tension has many parallels in\nstatistics, with the Bayesians on logico-inductive side vs the non-Bayesians or\nthe frequentists on the other side. Simplistically Popper seems to be on the\nfrequentist side, but recent synthesis on the non-Bayesian side might direct\nthe Popperian views to a more nuanced destination. Logical probability seems\nperfectly suited to measure partial evidence or support, so what can we use if\nwe are to reject it? For the past 100 years, statisticians have also developed\na related concept called likelihood, which has played a central role in\nstatistical modelling and inference. Remarkably, this Fisherian concept of\nuncertainty is largely unknown or at least severely under-appreciated in\nnon-statistical literature. As a measure of corroboration, the likelihood\nsatisfies the Popperian requirement that it is not a probability. Our aim is to\nintroduce the likelihood and its recent extension via a discussion of two\nwell-known logical fallacies in order to highlight that its lack of recognition\nmay have led to unnecessary confusion in our discourse about falsification and\ncorroboration of hypotheses.

The preceding work is based on the\nmicro-turbulence associated with toroidal ion temperature gradient (ITG) mode,\nand slab-based phenomenological model of zonal flow. When full toroidal effect\nare introduced into the system, two branches of zonal flow emerge: the\ntorus-modified low frequency zonal flow (TLFZF), and GAM, necessitating a\nunified exploration of GAM and TLFZF. Indeed, we observe that the transition\n(decay) from the caviton to instanton is triggered by a rapid zero-crossing of\nradial group velocity of drift wave and is found to be strongly correlated with\nthe GAM onset. Many features peculiar to intermittent GAMs, observed in real\nmachines, are thus identified in the numerical experiment. The results will be\ndisplayed in figures and in a movie; first for single central rational surface,\nand then with coupled multiple central rational surfaces. The periodic bursting\nfirst shown disappears as being replaced by irregular one, more similar to the\nintermittent characteristics observed in GAM experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 05:20:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2020 00:32:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

In this paper we focus\non an important challenge that is at the core of time series causal discovery:\nregime-dependent causal relations. Often dynamical systems feature transitions\ndepending on some, often persistent, unobserved background regime, and\ndifferent regimes may exhibit different causal relations. Here, we assume a\npersistent and discrete regime variable leading to a finite number of regimes\nwithin which we may assume stationary causal relations. To detect\nregime-dependent causal relations, we combine the conditional\nindependence-based PCMCI method with a regime learning optimisation approach.\nPCMCI allows for linear and nonlinear, high-dimensional time series causal\ndiscovery. Our method, Regime-PCMCI, is evaluated on a number of numerical\nexperiments demonstrating that it can distinguish regimes with different causal\ndirections, time lags, effects and sign of causal links, as well as changes in\nthe variables' autocorrelation.

Such a highly developed source model can solve the permutation problem\nof the frequency-domain BSS to a large extent, which is the reason for the\nexcellence of ILRMA. In this paper, we further improve the separation\nperformance of ILRMA by additionally considering the general structure of\nspectrograms, which is called consistency, and hence we call the proposed\nmethod Consistent ILRMA. Since a spectrogram is calculated by an overlapping\nwindow (and a window function induces spectral smearing called main- and\nside-lobes), the time-frequency bins depend on each other. In other words, the\ntime-frequency components are related to each other via the uncertainty\nprinciple. Such co-occurrence among the spectral components can function as an\nassistant for solving the permutation problem, which has been demonstrated by a\nrecent study. On the basis of these facts, we propose an algorithm for\nrealizing Consistent ILRMA by slightly modifying the original algorithm. Its\nperformance was extensively evaluated through experiments performed with\nvarious window lengths and shift lengths. The results indicated several\ntendencies of the original and proposed ILRMA that include some topics not\nfully discussed in the literature. For example, the proposed Consistent ILRMA\ntends to outperform the original ILRMA when the window length is sufficiently\nlong compared to the reverberation time of the mixing system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 07:04:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2020 05:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

Molecular motors, chemical reaction networks, catalytic\nenzymes, and particles exchanging heat with different baths, constitute some\ninteresting examples of such a modelization. Moreover, they usually operate out\nof equilibrium, being characterized by a net production of entropy, which\nentails a constrained efficiency. Hitherto, in order to investigate multiple\nprocesses simultaneously driving a system, all theoretical approaches deal with\nthem independently, at a coarse-grained level, or employing a separation of\ntime-scales. Here, we explicitly take in consideration the interplay among\ntime-scales of different processes, and whether or not their own evolution\neventually relaxes toward an equilibrium state in a given sub-space. We propose\na general framework for multiple coupling, from which the well-known formulas\nfor the entropy production can be derived, depending on the available\ninformation about each single process. Furthermore, when one of the processes\ndoes not equilibrate in its sub-space, even if much faster than all the others,\nit introduces a finite correction to the entropy production. We employ our\nframework in various simple and pedagogical examples, for which such a\ncorrective term can be related to a typical scaling of physical quantities in\nplay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 07:19:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 08:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

In this study, we focus on the maintenance-related concerns of the\npost-deployment of smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executed programs\nthat run on a blockchain. They cannot be modified once deployed and hence they\nbring unique maintenance challenges compared to conventional software.\nAccording to the definition of ISO/IEC 14764, there are four kinds of software\nmaintenance, i.e., corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive\nmaintenance. This study aims to answer (i) What kinds of issues will smart\ncontract developers encounter for corrective, adaptive, perfective, and\npreventive maintenance after they are deployed to the Ethereum? (ii) What are\nthe current maintenance-related methods used for smart contracts? To obtain the\nanswers to these research questions, we first conducted a systematic literature\nreview to analyze 131 smart contract related research papers published from\n2014 to 2020. Since the Ethereum ecosystem is fast-growing, some results from\nprevious publications might be out-of-date and there may be a gap between\nacademia and industry. To address this, we performed an online survey of smart\ncontract developers on Github to validate our findings and received 165 useful\nresponses. Based on the survey feedback and literature review, we present the\nfirst empirical study on smart contract maintenance-related concerns. Our study\ncan help smart contract developers better maintain their smart contract-based\nprojects, and we highlight some key future research directions to improve the\nEthereum ecosystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 07:23:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 04:19:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

One possibility to obtain more robust and\nreliable results in adverse weather conditions is to use video-segmentation\napproaches instead of commonly used single-image segmentation methods.\nVideo-segmentation approaches capture temporal information of the previous\nvideo-frames in addition to current image information, and hence, they are more\nrobust against disturbances, especially if they occur in only a few frames of\nthe video-sequence. However, video-segmentation approaches, which are often\nbased on recurrent neural networks, cannot be applied in real-time applications\nanymore, since their recurrent structures in the network are computational\nexpensive. For instance, the inference time of the LSTM-ICNet, in which\nrecurrent units are placed at proper positions in the single-segmentation\napproach ICNet, increases up to 61 percent compared to the basic ICNet. Hence,\nin this work, the LSTM-ICNet is sped up by modifying the recurrent units of the\nnetwork so that it becomes real-time capable again. Experiments on different\ndatasets and various weather conditions show that the inference time can be\ndecreased by about 23 percent by these modifications, while they achieve\nsimilar performance than the LSTM-ICNet and outperform the single-segmentation\napproach enormously in adverse weather conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 07:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-02"}

However, a fundamental assumption in Andersons\ntreatment is that no energy is exchanged with the environment, in contrast to\nthe common knowledge that every real system is subject to dissipation.\nRecently, a growing number of theoretical studies has addressed disordered\nmedia with dissipation. In particular it has been predicted that in such\nsystems all eigenstates exponentially localize, similar to the original case\nwithout dissipation that Anderson considered. However, in dissipative systems\nan eigenstate analysis is insufficient for characterizing the transport\ndynamics of wave, in stark contrast to Hermitian systems, where the\nlocalization of all eigenstates necessarily suppresses transport. In our work,\nwe show in theory and experiment that systems with dissipative disorder allow\nfor a new type of spatial transport, despite the fact that all eigenstates are\nexponentially localized. This Anderson transport is characterized by\nsuper-diffusive spreading and ultra-far spatial jumps between localized states.\nWe anticipate our findings to mark the starting point towards novel phenomena\nin dissipative media, which are subject to general non-Hermitian disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 07:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-02"}

Because polar stroking guarantees small uniform\nsteps in tangent angle, it provides an efficient way to accumulate arc length\nalong a path for texturing or dashing.

With these expressions, modified adaptive construction\nmethods for GEB are proposed, which use only the quantized estimated power\nlevels on angular patches. The performances of the proposed slow-time\nadaptation techniques for statistical Massive MIMO beamforming are evaluated in\nterms of the output signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR),\ninstantaneous channel estimation and beam accuracy. They are shown to be very\nefficient such that the computational complexity is significantly reduced while\nthe performance remains almost the same as that of the ideal GEB even in large\nangular estimation errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 08:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-02"}

In this paper, we propose a new coverage criterion, code\ncombinations coverage, that combines the concepts of code coverage and\ncombination coverage. We apply this coverage criterion to RTCP, as a new\nprioritization technique, code combinations coverage based prioritization\n(CCCP). We report on empirical studies conducted to compare the testing\neffectiveness and efficiency of CCCP with four popular RTCP techniques: total,\nadditional, adaptive random, and search-based test prioritization.

The CCCP prioritization costs are also\nfound to be comparable to the additional test prioritization technique.\nMoreover, our results also show that when the combination strength is\nincreased, CCCP provides higher fault detection rates than the\nstate-of-the-art, regardless of the levels of code coverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 10:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-02"}

Prevalent distribution-matching domain adaptation methods\nare inadequate in such a setting that demands adaptation from a smaller source\ndomain to a larger and diverse target domain with more classes. For addressing\nthis specific open set domain adaptation setting, prior research introduces a\ndomain adversarial model that uses a fixed threshold for distinguishing known\nfrom unknown target samples and lacks at handling negative transfers. We extend\ntheir adversarial model and propose a novel adversarial domain adaptation model\nwith multiple auxiliary classifiers. The proposed multi-classifier structure\nintroduces a weighting module that evaluates distinctive domain characteristics\nfor assigning the target samples with weights which are more representative to\nwhether they are likely to belong to the known and unknown classes to encourage\npositive transfers during adversarial training and simultaneously reduces the\ndomain gap between the shared classes of the source and target domains.

Until recently this has been achieved\nby only optimizing the placement of the footstep, keeping the duration of the\nstep constant. In this paper we introduce a footstep planner capable of\noptimizing footstep placement and timing in real-time by asynchronously\ncombining two optimizers, which we refer to as asynchronous real-time\noptimization (ARTO). The first optimizer which runs at approximately 25 Hz,\nutilizes a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method to accurately approximate the\ndynamics of the linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model for bipedal walking, then\nuses non-linear optimization to find optimal footsteps and duration at a lower\nfrequency. The second optimizer that runs at approximately 250 Hz, uses\nanalytical gradients derived from the full dynamics of the LIP model and\nconstraint penalty terms to perform gradient descent, which finds approximately\noptimal footstep placement and timing at a higher frequency. By combining the\ntwo optimizers asynchronously, ARTO has the benefits of fast reactions to\ndisturbances from the gradient descent optimizer, accurate solutions that avoid\nlocal optima from the RK4 optimizer, and increases the probability that a\nfeasible solution will be found from the two optimizers.

However, most double perovskites, including Cs2AgBiBr6, have wide\nbandgaps, which limit photo conversion efficiencies. The bandgap can be reduced\nthrough hallowing with Sb3+, but Sb-rich alloys are difficult to synthesise due\nto the high formation energy of Cs2AgSbBr6, which itself has a wide bandgap. We\ndevelop a solution-based route to synthesis phase-pure Cs2Ag(SbxBi1-x)Br6 thin\nfilms, with the mixing parameter x continuous varying over the entire\ncomposition range. We reveal that the mixed alloys (x between 0.5 and 0.9)\ndemonstrate smaller bandgaps (as low as 2.08 eV) than the pure Sb- (2.18 eV)\nand Bi-based (2.25 eV) compounds, with strong deviation from Vegard's law.\nThrough in-depth computations, we propose that bandgap lowering arises from the\nType II band alignment between Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgSbBr6. The energy mismatch\nbetween the Bi and Sb s and p atomic orbitals, coupled with their non-linear\nmixing, results in the alloys adopting a smaller bandgap than the pure\ncompounds. Our work demonstrates an approach to achieve bandgap reduction and\nhighlights that bandgap bowing may be found in other double perovskite alloys\nby pairing together materials forming a Type II band alignment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 11:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

We formulate the governing\nmathematical model as a Bayesian inverse problem, considering model parameters\nas a random process with an underlying probability distribution. MCMC allows us\nto sample from this distribution, but it comes with some limitations: it can be\nprohibitively expensive when dealing with costly likelihood functions,\nsubsequent samples are often highly correlated, and the standard\nMetropolis-Hastings algorithm suffers from the curse of dimensionality. This\npaper designs a Metropolis-Hastings proposal which exploits a deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) approximation of a groundwater flow model, to significantly\naccelerate MCMC sampling.

In many applications the function $g$ is practically\nunknown, as function evaluation involves time consuming numerical simulation or\nsome other form of experiment that is expensive to perform.

Previous\nstudies seem to indicate an anomalous chemical pattern of the youngest stellar\npopulation in the solar vicinity with a sub-solar metal content. This can\ninfluence various observational relations linking the properties of exoplanets\nto the characteristics of the host stars, for example the giant\nplanet-metallicity relation. In this framework, we aim to expand our knowledge\nof the chemical composition of intermediate-age stars and understand whether\nthese peculiarities are real or related to spectroscopic analysis techniques.\nWe analysed high-resolution optical and near-infrared GIARPS spectra of\nintermediate-age stars (< 700Myr). To overcome issues related to the young ages\nof the stars, we applied a new spectroscopic method that uses titanium lines to\nderive the atmospheric parameters, in particular surface gravities and\nmicroturbulence velocity parameter. We also derived abundances of 14 different\natomic species. The lack of systematic trends between elemental abundances and\neffective temperatures validates our method. However, we observed that the\ncoolest (<5400 K) stars in the sample, display higher abundances for the Cr II,\nand for high-excitation potential C I lines. We found a positive correlation\nbetween the higher abundances measured of C I and Cr II and the activity index\nlogR$_{HK}$. Instead, we found no correlations between the C abundances\nobtained from CH molecular band at 4300\\AA, and both effective temperatures and\nactivity. Thus, we suggest that these are better estimates for C abundances in\nyoung and cool stars. Finally, we found an indication of an increasing\nabundance ratio [X/H] with the condensation temperature for HD167389,\nindicating possible episodes of planet engulfment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 13:26:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

We investigate the repercussions of this\nobservation by examining three illustrative regimes: the bare ionic, density\ntight-binding, and density nearly-free electron models. For the bare ionic\nmodel, we demonstrate the zero elements in the force constants matrix and\nexplain this phenomenon as a natural consequence of Poisson's law. In the\ndensity tight-binding model, we confirm that the inclusion of localized\nelectrons stabilizes all major crystal structures at harmonic order and we\nconstruct a phase diagram of preferred structures with respect to core and\nvalence electron radii.

Low-rank MR-MOTUS exploits\nspatio-temporal correlations in internal body motion with a low-rank motion\nmodel, and inverts a signal model that relates motion-fields directly to a\nreference image and k-space data. The low-rank model reduces the\ndegrees-of-freedom, memory consumption and reconstruction times by assuming a\nfactorization of space-time motion-fields in spatial and temporal components.\nLow-rank MR-MOTUS was employed to estimate motion in 2D/3D abdominothoracic\nscans and 3D head scans. Data were acquired using golden-ratio radial readouts.\nReconstructed 2D and 3D respiratory motion-fields were respectively validated\nagainst time-resolved and respiratory-resolved image reconstructions, and the\nhead motion against static image reconstructions from fully-sampled data\nacquired right before and right after the motion.

A typical way to achieve good generalization is to\nlearn a model from vast data. In the context of heuristic search, such a\nparadigm could be implemented as configuring the parameters of a parallel\nalgorithm portfolio (PAP) based on a set of training problem instances, which\nis often referred to as PAP construction. However, compared to traditional\nmachine learning, PAP construction often suffers from the lack of training\ninstances, and the obtained PAPs may fail to generalize well. This paper\nproposes a novel competitive co-evolution scheme, named Co-Evolution of\nParameterized Search (CEPS), as a remedy to this challenge. By co-evolving a\nconfiguration population and an instance population, CEPS is capable of\nobtaining generalizable PAPs with few training instances. The advantage of CEPS\nin improving generalization is analytically shown in this paper.

It is shown that the fastest Atwood bubble is regular and stable,\nand the fastest Atwood spike is singular and unstable. The essentially\nmulti-scale and interfacial character of RT dynamics is demonstrated. The\nformer can be understood by viewing RT coherent structure of bubbles and spikes\nas a standing wave with the growing amplitude. The latter implies that RT flow\nhas effectively no motion of the fluids away from the interface and has intense\nmotion of the fluids near the interface, with shear-driven vortical structures\nappearing at the interface. Our theory agrees with available observations, and\nelaborates extensive benchmarks for future research and for better\nunderstanding of RT driven phenomena in plasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 14:21:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

To\nresolve this conflict, in this work, we extend the classical concept of an\nevent to the quantum domain by defining an event as a transfer of information\nbetween physical systems.

In this paper, we introduce the \\emph{regularized online\nallocation problem}, a variant that includes a non-linear regularizer acting on\nthe total resource consumption. In this problem, requests repeatedly arrive\nover time and, for each request, a decision maker needs to take an action that\ngenerates a reward and consumes resources. The objective is to simultaneously\nmaximize additively separable rewards and the value of a non-separable\nregularizer subject to the resource constraints. Our primary motivation is\nallowing decision makers to trade off separable objectives such as the economic\nefficiency of an allocation with ancillary, non-separable objectives such as\nthe fairness or equity of an allocation. We design an algorithm that is simple,\nfast, and attains good performance with both stochastic i.i.d.~and adversarial\ninputs. In particular, our algorithm is asymptotically optimal under stochastic\ni.i.d. input models and attains a fixed competitive ratio that depends on the\nregularizer when the input is adversarial.

While these features have been observed in\ntheoretical models and experiments, little is known about the underlying\nmesoscopic processes at the cluster level. Here we show that emergence and\nmaintenance of polar order are governed by the interplay between the assembly\nand disassembly dynamics of clusters with varying size and degree of polar\norder. Using agent-based simulations of propelled filaments in a parameter\nregime relevant for actomyosin motility assays, we monitor the temporal\nevolution of cluster statistics and the transport processes of filaments\nbetween clusters. We find that, over a broad parameter range, the emergence of\norder is determined by nucleation and growth of polar clusters, where the\nnucleation threshold depends not only on the cluster size but also on its polar\nmoment. Growth involves cluster self-replication, and polar order is\nestablished by cluster growth and fragmentation. Maintenance of the\nmicrophase-separated, polar-ordered state results from a cyclic dynamics in\ncluster size and order, driven by an interplay between cluster nucleation,\ncoagulation, fragmentation and evaporation of single filaments. These findings\nare corroborated by a kinetic model for the cluster dynamics that includes\nthese elementary cluster-level processes. It consistently reproduces the\ncluster statistics as well as the cyclic turnover from disordered to ordered\nclusters and back. Such cyclic kinetic processes could represent a general\nmechanism for the maintenance of order in active matter systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 14:29:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 14:47:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

Reflective and formative measurement models offer different\nconceptualizations of the relation between the indicators and what is sometimes\nconceived of as a univariate latent variable supposed to correspond in some way\nto the construct. It is argued that the empirical implications of reflective\nand formative models will often be violated by data since the causally relevant\nconstituents will generally be multivariate, not univariate. These empirical\nimplications can be formally tested but factor analysis is not adequate to do\nso. It is argued that formative models misconstrue the relationship between the\nconstructed measures and the underlying reality by which causal processes\noperate, but that reflective models misconstrue the nature of the underlying\nreality itself by typically presuming that the constituents of it that are\ncausally efficacious are unidimensional.

We have tested this hypothesis by\nmeasuring the effect of various pulsed diode lasers on the O$^-$ beam current\nproduced from Al$_2$O$_3$ cathode of a cesium sputter ion source. It is\nexpected that the ion pair production of O$^-$ requires populating the 5d\nelectronic states of neutral cesium, thus implying that the process should be\nprovoked only with specific wavelengths.

We develop\na semi-analytical model of the non-thermal emission of the colliding-wind\nstructure including the dynamical effects of orbital motion. We apply the model\nto a general case and to LS 5039. The model consists of a one-dimensional\nemitter the geometry of which is affected by Coriolis forces owing to orbital\nmotion. Two particle accelerators are considered: one at the two-wind standoff\nlocation, and the other one at the turnover produced by the Coriolis force.\nSynchrotron and inverse Compton emission is studied, accounting for Doppler\nboosting and absorption processes associated to the massive star. If both\naccelerators are provided with the same energy budget, most of the radiation\ncomes from the region of the Coriolis turnover and beyond, up to a few orbital\nseparations from the binary system. The model allows us to reproduce some of\nthe LS 5039 emission features, but not all of them. In particular, the MeV\nradiation is probably too high to be explained by our model alone, the GeV flux\nis recovered but not its modulation, and the radio emission beyond the Coriolis\nturnover is too low. The predicted system inclination is consistent with the\npresence of a pulsar in the binary. The model is quite successful in\nreproducing the overall non-thermal behavior of LS 5039.

Within a phenomenological theory, the system is\ndescribed as a stack of two continuum crystalline membranes, characterized by\nfinite elastic moduli and a nonzero bending rigidity. A nonlinear\nrotationally-invariant model guided by elasticity theory is developed to\ndescribe interlayer interactions. After neglection of in-plane phonon\nnonlinearities and anharmonic interactions involving interlayer shear and\ncompression modes, an effective theory for soft flexural fluctuations of the\nbilayer is constructed. The resulting model, neglecting anisotropic\ninteractions, has the same form of a well-known effective theory for\nout-of-plane fluctuations in a single-layer membrane, but with a strongly\nwave-vector dependent bare bending rigidity. Focusing on AB-stacked bilayer\ngraphene, parameters governing interlayer interactions in the theory are\nderived by first-principles calculations.

We carry out numerical simulations of\nneutron star merger ejecta to demonstrate that the observed radio light curve\nis well reproduced by a merger model with astrophysically expected parameters.\nWe examine the observed radio data, as well as the host galaxy, to find clues\nthat could differentiate the transient's neutron star merger origin from the\nalternative explanation---the afterglow of an off-axis long gamma-ray burst.\nNear-future observations could find further evidence for the FIRST J1419+3940\nradio transient's origin. We show that existing radio surveys likely already\nrecorded multiple radio flares, informing us of the origin and properties of\nneutrons tar mergers and their role in the nucleosynthesis of the heaviest\nelements in the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 15:48:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 2020 00:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

We performed excitation and radiative\ntransfer calculations based on the LVG method to model the observed lines of\nthe molecules and to derive their fractional abundances in the observed\nenvelopes.\n  Results:We detected SiO in all 30 targeted envelopes, as well as CS, SiS, SO,\nand SO$_2$ in 18, 13, 26, and 19 sources, respectively. Remarkably, SiS is not\ndetected in any envelope with a mass loss rate below $10^{-6}$ M$_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$, whereas it is detected in all envelopes with mass loss rates above\nthat threshold. From a comparison with a previous, similar study on C-rich\nsources, it becomes evident that the fractional abundances of CS and SiS show a\nmarked differentiation between C-rich and O-rich sources, being two orders of\nmagnitude and one order of magnitude more abundant in C-rich sources,\nrespectively, while the fractional abundance of SiO turns out to be insensitive\nto the C/O ratio. The abundance of SiO in O-rich envelopes behaves similarly to\nC-rich sources, that is, the denser the envelope the lower its abundance. A\nsimilar trend, albeit less clear than for SiO, is observed for SO in O-rich\nsources.\n  Conclusions: The marked dependence of CS and SiS abundances on the C/O ratio\nindicates that these two molecules form more efficiently in C- than O-rich\nenvelopes.

The considered problem\nbelongs to the category of mixed-integer non-linear programming problem\n(MINLP), {\\color{black} and thus is NP-hard}. To cope up with this complexity\nand to derive a trade-off between system throughput and energy utilization, we\nfirst restate the considered problem as a multi-objective optimization problem\n(MOOP) aiming at maximizing system's throughput and minimizing system's energy\nconsumption, simultaneously.

A\nhadronic star can convert into a strange quark star with a larger radius\nbecause the consequent reduction of $(BE)_g$ is over-compensated by the large\nincrease in $(BE)_n$. Thus, the total binding energy increases due to the\nconversion and the process is exothermic. Depending on the equations of state\nof hadronic matter and quark matter and on the baryonic mass of the star, the\ncontrary is obviously also possible, namely the conversion of hadronic stars\ninto strange quark stars having smaller radii, a situation more often discussed\nin the literature.

Taking into account the $f(R)$ gravity parameter $\\eta$, the\ndecreasing scheme of the holographic quantities persist. However, we observe a\ntransition-like point where the behavior of the holographic tools change. Two\nregions meeting at such a transit-like point are shown up. In such a\nnomination, the first one is associated with slow accelerating black holes\nwhile the second one corresponds to a fast accelerating solution. In the first\nregion, the holographic entanglement entropy and two-point correlation\nfunctions decrease by increasing the $\\eta$ parameter. However, the behavioral\nsituation is reversed in the second one. Moreover, a cross-comparison between\nthe entropy and the holographic entanglement entropy is presented providing\nanother counter-example showing that such two quantities do not exhibit similar\nbehaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 13:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}
