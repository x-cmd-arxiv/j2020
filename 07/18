This inhibits the use of such frameworks on commodity\nhardware. The root cause of the low efficiency in existing co-search frameworks\nis the fact that they start from a \"cold\" state (i.e., search from scratch). In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework, namely HotNAS, that starts from a\n\"hot\" state based on a set of existing pre-trained models (a.k.a. model zoo) to\navoid lengthy training time. As such, the search time can be reduced from 200\nGPU hours to less than 3 GPU hours. In HotNAS, in addition to hardware design\nspace and neural architecture search space, we further integrate a compression\nspace to conduct model compressing during the co-search, which creates new\nopportunities to reduce latency but also brings challenges. One of the key\nchallenges is that all of the above search spaces are coupled with each other,\ne.g., compression may not work without hardware design support. To tackle this\nissue, HotNAS builds a chain of tools to design hardware to support\ncompression, based on which a global optimizer is developed to automatically\nco-search all the involved search spaces.

When applying this parameterization to the\nfirst 13 gravitational-wave events detected by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration\n(LVC), we find that the highest-spinning object is constrained to have nonzero\nspin for most sources and to have significant support at the Kerr limit for\nGW151226 and GW170729. A joint analysis of all the confident binary black hole\ndetections by the LVC finds that, unlike with the traditional parametrization,\nthe distribution of spin magnitude for the highest-spinning object has\nnegligible support at zero spin. Regardless of the parameterization used, the\nconfiguration where all of the spins in the population are aligned with the\norbital angular momentum is excluded from the 90% credible interval for the\nfirst ten events and from the 99% credible interval for all current confident\ndetections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 18:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 20:27:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

It consists of studying four-point\ncorrelators of single-particle operators in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM at large $N$\nand large 't Hooft coupling $\\lambda$, by looking at the regime in which the\ndual KK modes become short massive strings. In this regime the charge of the\nsingle-particle operators is order $\\lambda^{1/4}$ and the dual KK modes are in\nbetween fields and strings. Starting from SUGRA we compute the large $p$ limit\nof the correlators by introducing an improved $AdS_5\\times S^5$ Mellin space\namplitude, and we show that the correlator is dominated by a saddle point. Our\nresults are consistent with the picture of four geodesics shooting from the\nboundary of $AdS_5\\times S^5$ towards a common bulk point, where they scatter\nas if they were in flat space. The Mandelstam invariants are put in\ncorrespondence with the Mellin variables and in turn with certain combinations\nof cross ratios. At the saddle point the dynamics of the correlator is directly\nrelated to the bulk Mellin amplitude, which in the process of taking large $p$\nbecomes the flat space ten-dimensional S-matrix. We thus learn how to embed the\nfull type IIB S-matrix in the $AdS_5\\times S^5$ Mellin amplitude, and how to\nstratify the latter in a large $p$ expansion. We compute the large $p$ limit of\nall genus zero data currently available, pointing out additional hidden\nsimplicity of known results. We then show that the genus zero resummation at\nlarge $p$ naturally leads to the Gross-Mende phase for the minimal area surface\naround the bulk point. At one-loop, we first uncover a novel and finite Mellin\namplitude, and then we show that the large $p$ limit beautifully asymptotes the\ngravitational S-matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 18:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Most existing works simply assume that depth measurements are\naccurate and well-aligned with the RGB pixels and models the problem as a\ncross-modal feature fusion to obtain better feature representations to achieve\nmore accurate segmentation. This, however, may not lead to satisfactory results\nas actual depth data are generally noisy, which might worsen the accuracy as\nthe networks go deeper.\n  In this paper, we propose a unified and efficient Cross-modality Guided\nEncoder to not only effectively recalibrate RGB feature responses, but also to\ndistill accurate depth information via multiple stages and aggregate the two\nrecalibrated representations alternatively. The key of the proposed\narchitecture is a novel Separation-and-Aggregation Gating operation that\njointly filters and recalibrates both representations before cross-modality\naggregation. Meanwhile, a Bi-direction Multi-step Propagation strategy is\nintroduced, on the one hand, to help to propagate and fuse information between\nthe two modalities, and on the other hand, to preserve their specificity along\nthe long-term propagation process. Besides, our proposed encoder can be easily\ninjected into the previous encoder-decoder structures to boost their\nperformance on RGB-D semantic segmentation.

The decision maker then needs to choose\nan optimal vector of attributes for each product that balances this trade-off.\nIn spite of the importance of such problems, there is not yet a method to solve\nit efficiently in general. Past literature in revenue management and discrete\nchoice models focus on pricing problems, where price is the only attribute to\nbe chosen for each product. Existing approaches to solve pricing problems\ntractably cannot be generalized to the optimization problem with multiple\nproduct attributes as decision variables. On the other hand, papers studying\nproduct line design with multiple attributes all result in intractable\noptimization problems. Then we found a way to reformulate the static\nmulti-attribute optimization problem, as well as the multi-stage fluid\noptimization problem with both resource constraints and upper and lower bounds\nof attributes, as a tractable convex conic optimization problem. Our result\napplies to optimization problems under the multinomial logit (MNL) model, the\nMarkov chain (MC) choice model, and with certain conditions, the nested logit\n(NL) model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 19:20:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 15:06:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 19:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-24"}

Common biological\nsystems of coupled oscillators have been shown to be members of the Ising\nuniversality class, meaning that the very simple Ising model replicates certain\nspatial statistics of these systems at stationarity. This observation is useful\nbecause it reveals which aspects of spatial pattern arise independently of the\ndetails governing local dynamics, resulting in both deeper understanding of and\na simpler baseline model for biological synchrony. However, in many situations\na system's dynamics are of greater interest than their static spatial\nproperties. Here, we ask whether a dynamical Ising model can replicate\nuniversal and non-universal features of ecological systems, using noisy coupled\nmetapopulation models with two-cycle dynamics as a case study. The standard\nIsing model makes unrealistic dynamical predictions, but the Ising model with\nmemory corrects this by using an additional parameter to reflect the tendency\nfor local dynamics to maintain their phase of oscillation. By fitting the two\nparameters of the Ising model with memory to simulated ecological dynamics, we\nassess the correspondence between the Ising and ecological models in several of\ntheir features (location of the critical boundary in parameter space between\nsynchronous and asynchronous dynamics, probability of local phase changes, and\nability to predict future dynamics). We find that the Ising model with memory\nis reasonably good at representing these properties of ecological\nmetapopulations. The correspondence between these models creates the potential\nfor the simple and well-known Ising class of models to become a valuable tool\nfor understanding complex biological systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 19:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

One way to achieve this goal is through the efficient\ninitialization of the algorithm with a near-optimal solution. This paper\nexamines various machine learning (ML) algorithms available in the Scikit-Learn\nlibrary to initialize an SLP-ACOPF solver, including examining linear and\nnonlinear ML algorithms. We evaluate the quality of each of these machine\nlearning algorithms for predicting variables needed for a power flow solution.\nThe solution is then used as an initialization for an SLP-ACOPF algorithm. The\napproach is tested on a congested and non-congested 3 bus systems. The results\nobtained from the best-performed ML algorithm in this work are compared with\nthe results of a DCOPF solution for the initialization of an SLP-ACOPF solver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 20:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

To fully exploit the supervision in the source\ndomain, we propose a fine-grained adversarial learning strategy for class-level\nfeature alignment while preserving the internal structure of semantics across\ndomains. We adopt a fine-grained domain discriminator that not only plays as a\ndomain distinguisher, but also differentiates domains at class level.

Furthermore, most existing work on FL measures global-model\naccuracy, but in many cases, such as user content-recommendation, improving\nindividual User model Accuracy (UA) is the real objective. To address these\nissues, we propose a Multi-Task FL (MTFL) algorithm that introduces\nnon-federated Batch-Normalization (BN) layers into the federated DNN. MTFL\nbenefits UA and convergence speed by allowing users to train models\npersonalised to their own data. MTFL is compatible with popular iterative FL\noptimisation algorithms such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), and we show\nempirically that a distributed form of Adam optimisation (FedAvg-Adam) benefits\nconvergence speed even further when used as the optimisation strategy within\nMTFL. Experiments using MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrate that MTFL is able to\nsignificantly reduce the number of rounds required to reach a target UA, by up\nto $5\\times$ when using existing FL optimisation strategies, and with a further\n$3\\times$ improvement when using FedAvg-Adam. We compare MTFL to competing\npersonalised FL algorithms, showing that it is able to achieve the best UA for\nMNIST and CIFAR10 in all considered scenarios.

However, increased number of individuals also changed the\ndynamics of the system which makes control of a multi-robot system more\ncomplicated. Even worse, if the whole system is sitting on a centralized\ndecision making unit, the data flow could be easily overloaded due to the\nupscaling of the system.

However, controllable generation with GANs remains a\nchallenging research problem. Achieving controllable generation requires\nsemantically interpretable and disentangled factors of variation. It is\nchallenging to achieve this goal using simple fixed distributions such as\nGaussian distribution. Instead, we propose an unsupervised framework to learn a\ndistribution of latent codes that control the generator through self-training.\nSelf-training provides an iterative feedback in the GAN training, from the\ndiscriminator to the generator, and progressively improves the proposal of the\nlatent codes as training proceeds. The latent codes are sampled from a latent\nvariable model that is learned in the feature space of the discriminator. We\nconsider a normalized independent component analysis model and learn its\nparameters through tensor factorization of the higher-order moments.

Our approach allows us to find the coefficients which\nBrandt's result was not giving explicitly.

The\nfirst challenge is the inability of the DRL algorithm to ensure that every item\nis processed identically regardless of its position in the queue.

Polarization images\nare known to be able to capture polarized reflected lights that preserve rich\ngeometric cues of an object, which has motivated its recent applications in\nreconstructing surface normal of the objects of interest. Inspired by the\nrecent advances in human shape estimation from single color images, in this\npaper, we attempt at estimating human body shapes by leveraging the geometric\ncues from single polarization images. A dedicated two-stage deep learning\napproach, SfP, is proposed: given a polarization image, stage one aims at\ninferring the fined-detailed body surface normal; stage two gears to\nreconstruct the 3D body shape of clothing details.

Recently, great advances have been made in searching for\noptimal augmentation policies in the image classification domain.

First is that most if not all modern augmentation search methods are\noffline and learning policies are isolated from their usage. The learned\npolicies are mostly constant throughout the training process and are not\nadapted to the current training model state. Second, the policies rely on\nclass-preserving image processing functions. Hence applying current offline\nmethods to new tasks may require domain knowledge to specify such kind of\noperations. In this work, we offer an orthogonal online data augmentation\nscheme together with three new augmentation networks, co-trained with the\ntarget learning task. It is both more efficient, in the sense that it does not\nrequire expensive offline training when entering a new domain, and more\nadaptive as it adapts to the learner state. Our augmentation networks require\nless domain knowledge and are easily applicable to new tasks.

These two spacecrafts will then fly in a formation approximating a\nsingle rigid telescope. In order to achieve this configuration, the two\nspacecraft must maintain the formation a focal length distance apart, with\ncentimeter level control, and sub-millimeter level knowledge requirements.\nAdditionally, the system must keep the telescope axis pointed at a fixed target\non the celestial sphere for extended durations. VTXOs system architecture calls\nfor two CubeSats to operate in a highly eccentric Earth orbit with one of the\nspacecrafts traveling on a natural keplarian orbit.

We\nfind that the emission at lower energies comes from a diffuse or extended\ncomponent, while the major contribution of gamma rays above 1 TeV arises from\nthe southern part of the source. Moreover, we find that a significant curvature\nis present in the combined observed spectrum of MAGIC and Fermi-LAT. The first\nmulti-wavelength spectral energy distribution of this unidentified source shows\nthat the emission at GeV-TeV energies can be well explained with both leptonic\nand hadronic models. For the leptonic scenario, bremsstrahlung is the dominant\nemission compared to inverse Compton.

For the last problem,\nin which the objective is to minimize the difference between the maximum and\nminimum load, the optimal objective value may be zero and hence it is NP-hard\nto obtain any multiplicative approximation guarantee.

We introduce the\nproblem of personalized online language learning (POLL), which involves fitting\npersonalized language models to a population of users that evolves over time.\nTo facilitate research on POLL, we collect massive datasets of Twitter posts.\nThese datasets, Firehose10M and Firehose100M, comprise 100 million tweets,\nposted by one million users over six years. Enabled by the Firehose datasets,\nwe present a rigorous evaluation of continual learning algorithms on an\nunprecedented scale. Based on this analysis, we develop a simple algorithm for\ncontinual gradient descent (ConGraD) that outperforms prior continual learning\nmethods on the Firehose datasets as well as earlier benchmarks. Collectively,\nthe POLL problem setting, the Firehose datasets, and the ConGraD algorithm\nenable a complete benchmark for reproducible research on web-scale continual\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2020 05:40:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 02:34:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

Anchor boxes are densely proposed over the images and the network is\ntrained to predict the boxes position offset as well as the classification\nconfidence. Existing systems pre-define anchor box shapes and sizes and ad-hoc\nheuristic adjustments are used to define the anchor configurations. However,\nthis might be sub-optimal or even wrong when a new dataset or a new model is\nadopted. In this paper, we study the problem of automatically optimizing anchor\nboxes for object detection. We first demonstrate that the number of anchors,\nanchor scales and ratios are crucial factors for a reliable object detection\nsystem. By carefully analyzing the existing bounding box patterns on the\nfeature hierarchy, we design a flexible and tight hyper-parameter space for\nanchor configurations. Then we propose a novel hyper-parameter optimization\nmethod named AABO to determine more appropriate anchor boxes for a certain\ndataset, in which Bayesian Optimization and subsampling method are combined to\nachieve precise and efficient anchor configuration optimization. Experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on different detectors and\ndatasets, e.g. achieving around 2.4% mAP improvement on COCO, 1.6% on ADE and\n1.5% on VG, and the optimal anchors can bring 1.4% to 2.4% mAP improvement on\nSOTA detectors by only optimizing anchor configurations, e.g. boosting Mask\nRCNN from 40.3% to 42.3%, and HTC detector from 46.8% to 48.2%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2020 05:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

The novel\nsetting of the semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) problem shares the\nchallenges with the domain adaptation problem and the semi-supervised learning\nproblem. However, a recent study shows that conventional domain adaptation and\nsemi-supervised learning methods often result in less effective or negative\ntransfer in the SSDA problem. In order to interpret the observation and address\nthe SSDA problem, in this paper, we raise the intra-domain discrepancy issue\nwithin the target domain, which has never been discussed so far. Then, we\ndemonstrate that addressing the intra-domain discrepancy leads to the ultimate\ngoal of the SSDA problem.

This goal can be achieved by magnetic-field controlled\nbirefringence, where colours are produced by the interference between\nphase-retarded components of transmitted polarised light. Thus far\nbirefringence-tuneable coloration has been demonstrated using electric field,\nmaterial chirality and mechanical strain but magnetic field control remained\nelusive due to either weak magneto-optical response of transparent media or low\ntransmittance to visible light of magnetically responsive media, such as\nferrofluids. Here we demonstrate magnetically tuneable colouration of aqueous\nsuspensions of two-dimensional cobalt-doped titanium oxide which exhibit an\nanomalously large magneto-birefringence effect. The colour of the suspensions\ncan be tuned over more than two wavelength cycles in the visible range by\nmoderate magnetic fields below 0.8 T. We show that such giant magneto-chromatic\nresponse is due to particularly large phase retardation (>3 pi) of the\npolarised light, which in its turn is a combined result of a large\nCotton-Mouton coefficient (three orders of magnitude larger than for known\nliquid crystals), relatively high saturation birefringence (delta n = 2 x\n10^-4) and high transparency of our suspensions to visible light. The work\nopens a new avenue to achieve tuneable colouration through engineered magnetic\nbirefringence and can readily be extended to other magnetic 2D nanocrystals.\nThe demonstrated effect can be used in a variety of magneto-optical\napplications, including magnetic field sensors, wavelength-tuneable optical\nfilters and see-through printing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2020 09:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Since natural and artificial\nlight-harvesting units operate under the stationary condition, we address this\nquestion via a non-equilibrium steady-state analysis of a molecular dimer\nirradiated by incoherent sunlight and then generalize the key predictions to\narbitrarily-complex exciton networks. The central result of the steady-state\nanalysis is the coherence-flux-efficiency relation:$\\eta=c\\sum_{i\\neq\nj}F_{ij}\\kappa_j=2c\\sum_{i\\neq j}J_{ij}{\\rm Im}[{\\rho}_{ij}]\\kappa_j$ with $c$\nthe normalization constant. In this relation, the first equality indicates that\nenergy transfer efficiency $\\eta$ is uniquely determined by the trapping flux,\nwhich is the product of flux $F$ and branching ratio $\\kappa$ for trapping at\nthe reaction centers, and the second equality indicates that the energy\ntransfer flux $F$ is equivalent to quantum coherence measured by the imaginary\npart of the off-diagonal density matrix, i.e., $F_{ij}=2J_{ij}{\\rm\nIm}[{\\rho}_{ij}]$. Consequently, maximal steady-state coherence gives rise to\noptimal efficiency. The coherence-flux-efficiency relation holds rigorously and\ngenerally for any exciton networks of arbitrary connectivity under the\nstationary condition and is not limited to incoherent radiation or incoherent\npumping. For light-harvesting systems under incoherent light, non-equilibrium\nenergy transfer flux (i.e. steady-state coherence) is driven by the breakdown\nof detailed balance and by the quantum interference of light-excitations and\nleads to the optimization of energy transfer efficiency. It should be noted\nthat the steady-state coherence or, equivalently, efficiency is the combined\nresult of light-induced transient coherence, inhomogeneous depletion, and\nsystem-bath correlation, and is thus not necessarily correlated with quantum\nbeatings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2020 01:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

This nature of the language could lead to a\nserious data sparsity problem, which may prevent the deep learning models from\nbeing well trained for under-resourced MCLs. In order to model the MCLs' words\neffectively, we introduce root and entity tag embedding plus tensor layer to\nthe neural networks.

A\ndirectional Gaussian smoothing (DGS) approach was recently proposed by the\nauthors (Zhang et al., 2020) and used to define a truly nonlocal gradient,\nreferred to as the DGS gradient, in order to enable nonlocal exploration in\nhigh-dimensional black-box optimization. Promising results show that replacing\nthe traditional local gradient with the nonlocal DGS gradient can significantly\nimprove the performance of gradient-based methods in optimizing highly\nmulti-modal loss functions. However, the current DGS method is designed for\nunbounded and unconstrained optimization problems, making it inapplicable to\nreal-world engineering design optimization problems where the tuning parameters\nare often bounded and the loss function is usually constrained by physical\nprocesses. In this work, we propose to extend the DGS approach to the\nconstrained inverse design framework in order to find a better design. The\nproposed framework has its advantages in portability and flexibility to\nnaturally incorporate the parameterization, physics simulation, and objective\nformulation together to build up an effective inverse design workflow. A series\nof adaptive strategies for smoothing radius and learning rate updating are\ndeveloped to improve the computational efficiency and robustness. To enable a\nclear binarized design, a dynamic growth mechanism is imposed on the projection\nstrength in parameterization. Our methodology is demonstrated by an example of\ndesigning a nanoscale wavelength demultiplexer and shows superior performance\ncompared to the state-of-the-art approaches. By incorporating volume\nconstraints, the optimized design achieves an equivalently high performance but\nsignificantly reduces the amount of material usage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2020 04:46:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 03:40:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2020 20:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

Fluid mechanics\nwithin aeronautical applications, for example, routinely feature rotating (e.g.\nturbines, wheels and fan blades) or sliding components (e.g. in compressor or\nturbine cascade simulations). With an increasing trend towards the\nhigh-fidelity modelling of these cases, in particular combined with the use of\nhigh-order discontinuous Galerkin methods, there is therefore a requirement to\nunderstand how different numerical treatments of the interfaces between the\nstatic mesh and the sliding/rotating part impact on overall solution quality.\nIn this article, we compare two different approaches to handle this\nnon-conformal interface. The first is the so-called mortar approach, where flux\nintegrals along edges are split according to the positioning of the\nnon-conformal grid. The second is a less-documented point-to-point\ninterpolation method, where the interior and exterior quantities for flux\nevaluations are interpolated from elements lying on the opposing side of the\ninterface. Although the mortar approach has significant advantages in terms of\nits numerical properties, in that it preserves the local conservation\nproperties of DG methods, in the context of complex 3D meshes it poses notable\nimplementation difficulties which the point-to-point method handles more\nreadily. In this paper we examine the numerical properties of each method,\nfocusing not only on observing convergence orders for smooth solutions, but\nalso how each method performs in under-resolved simulations of linear and\nnonlinear hyperbolic problems, to inform the use of these methods in implicit\nlarge-eddy simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 19:40:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 09:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

Most deep learning\narchitectures concentrate on splitting diverse categories, while ignoring the\nsimilarities amongst them. This paper introduces a framework that automatically\nanalyzes and configures a family of smaller deep networks as a replacement to a\nsingular, larger network. Class similarities guide the creation of a family\nfrom course to fine classifiers which solve categorical problems more\neffectively than a single large classifier. The resulting smaller networks are\nhighly scalable, parallel and more practical to train, and achieve higher\nclassification accuracy. This paper also proposes a method to adaptively select\nthe configuration of the hierarchical family of classifiers using linkage\nstatistics from overall and sub-classification confusion matrices.

While probabilistic ranking\nfunctions like the Okapi BM25 function have been utilized in IR systems since\nthe 1970's, modern neural approaches pose certain advantages compared to their\nclassical counterparts. In particular, the release of BERT (Bidirectional\nEncoder Representations from Transformers) has had a significant impact in the\nNLP community by demonstrating how the use of a Masked Language Model trained\non a large corpus of data can improve a variety of downstream NLP tasks,\nincluding sentence classification and passage re-ranking.
