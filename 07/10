With\nthe recent rise of quantum machine learning, it is natural to ask whether there\nis a quantum analog of the NFL theorem, which would restrict a quantum\ncomputer's ability to learn a unitary process (the quantum analog of a\nfunction) with quantum training data. However, in the quantum setting, the\ntraining data can possess entanglement, a strong correlation with no classical\nanalog. In this work, we show that entangled data sets lead to an apparent\nviolation of the (classical) NFL theorem. This motivates a reformulation that\naccounts for the degree of entanglement in the training set. As our main\nresult, we prove a quantum NFL theorem whereby the fundamental limit on the\nlearnability of a unitary is reduced by entanglement. We employ Rigetti's\nquantum computer to test both the classical and quantum NFL theorems. Our work\nestablishes that entanglement is a commodity in quantum machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 16:00:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 15:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

Specifically, three RGB-depth interaction modules, named CMW-L,\nCMW-M and CMW-H, are developed to deal with respectively low-, middle- and\nhigh-level cross-modal information fusion. These modules use Depth-to-RGB\nWeighing (DW) and RGB-to-RGB Weighting (RW) to allow rich cross-modal and\ncross-scale interactions among feature layers generated by different network\nblocks. To effectively train the proposed Cross-Modal Weighting Network\n(CMWNet), we design a composite loss function that summarizes the errors\nbetween intermediate predictions and ground truth over different scales. With\nall these novel components working together, CMWNet effectively fuses\ninformation from RGB and depth channels, and meanwhile explores object\nlocalization and details across scales. Thorough evaluations demonstrate CMWNet\nconsistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods on seven popular\nbenchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 16:01:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

In\nthe bulk analysis, we consider the instability of the electroneutral bulk\nregion driven by a second kind electroosmosis slip velocity boundary condition\nand derive the asymptotic solutions for small and large wavenumbers. In the\nfull analysis, we consider the entire region of the liquid electrolyte and use\nthe ultraspherical spectral method to numerically solve the eigenvalue\nproblems. Both studies show that the imposed flow significantly affects the\nelectroconvective instability. The imposed flow generates a shielding effect by\ndeforming the perturbed ion concentration field and hinders the ion transfer\nfrom low- to high- concentration regions which causes the instability. It fully\nsuppresses the electroconvective instability at small wavenumbers and reduces\nthe growth rate of the perturbations at large wavenumbers. The direct effect of\nthe flow on the morphological instability is minor, while the suppression of\nthe electroconvective instability may change the wavenumber of the most\nunstable mode of the coupled instabilities. For the electroconvective\ninstability, the bulk analysis is qualitatively different from the full\nanalysis at high wavenumbers.

Using the AdS approach, we\nrecover the various known boundary critical behaviors of the model, and we\ncompute the free energy for each boundary fixed point, finding results which\nare consistent with the conjectured $F$-theorem in a continuous range of\ndimensions. Finally, we also use the AdS setup to compute correlation functions\nand extract some of the BCFT data. In particular, we show that using the bulk\nequations of motion, in conjunction with crossing symmetry, gives an efficient\nway to constrain bulk two-point functions and extract anomalous dimensions of\nboundary operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 17:37:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 14:08:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 23:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

This \"trigger\"\nDM must be created, for example, in a previous annihilation or decay of a\nheavier component of DM. Remarkably, boosted DM annihilating into gamma-rays at\na specific point in a galaxy could actually have traveled from its source at\nanother point in the same galaxy or even from another galaxy. Such a\n\"non-local\" behavior leads to a non-trivial dependence of the resulting photon\nsignal on the galactic halo parameters, such as DM density and core size,\nencoded in the so-called \"astrophysical\" $J$-factor. These non-local\n$J$-factors are strikingly different than the usual scenario. A distinctive\naspect of this model is that the signal from dwarf galaxies relative to the\nMilky Way tends to be suppressed from the typical value to various degrees\ndepending on their characteristics. This feature can thus potentially alleviate\nthe mild tension between the DM annihilation explanation of the observed excess\nof $\\sim$ GeV photons from the Milky Way's galactic center vs. the apparent\nnon-observation of the corresponding signal from dwarf galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 17:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

In this \"attractive scenario,\" all DM will be boosted to high\nvelocities by the time it reaches direct detection apparatuses in laboratories.\nFurthermore, the attractive force leads to an enhanced DM number density at the\nEarth facilitating DM detection even more.

In this paper, we propose a tAsk-auGmented\nactIve meta-LEarning (AGILE) method to efficiently adapt DNNs to new tasks by\nusing a small number of training examples. AGILE combines a meta-learning\nalgorithm with a novel task augmentation technique which we use to generate an\ninitial adaptive model.

Besides that,\ncomplementarity relations are saturated only for pure, single-quanton, quantum\nstates. For mixed states, the wave-particle quantifiers never saturate the\ncomplementarity relation and can even reach zero for a maximally mixed state.\nSo, to fully characterize a quanton it is not sufficient to consider its\nwave-particle aspect; one has also to regard its correlations with other\nsystems. In this paper, we discuss the relation between quantum correlations\nand local classical uncertainty measures, as well as the relation between\nquantum coherence and quantum uncertainty quantifiers. We obtain a complete\ncomplementarity relation for quantum uncertainty, classical uncertainty, and\npredictability.

Reusable Learning\nObjects have actually been discussed in the literature for the last 20 years\nand yet true large scale sharing of learning and teaching materials remains\nrelatively rare and challenging. This paper argues that part of the reason is\nthat the granularity of the learning objects that are in use today is not\nconducive to true reuse. Certainly whole PowerPoint slide decks and word\ndocuments are kept in individual files and folders. It is not an ideal\nsituation. As a result, educators, teachers, course designers, are constantly\nreinventing the wheel, or searching for where that one excellent assignment,\nexplanation, definition was last seen so it can be copied forward. This paper\nargues that to achieve effective reuse of Learning Objects, the following are\nrequired: smaller, more granular (micro) learning objects; means to combine\nthem into larger presentation products; and modern revision and version\ncontrol. The paper proposes applying approaches originating in the software\nengineering community, such as agile methodology, version control and\nmanagement, markup languages, and agile publishing, which together form the\nAgile Approach of the title of the paper. With that foundation laid, the paper\nexamines CourseGen, an open source software platform designed for creating,\nsharing, reusing and publishing reusable course content. CourseGen uses a\nmodified markdown format augmented by CourseGen specific directives, such as\n$link to and $include topic. The CourseGen compiler converts a collection of\nCourseGen files into the final format such as a web site or a PowerPoint.\nCourseGen was designed, used and refined over the last three years in several\nComputer Science Courses at Brandeis University.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 21:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13"}

The speed data is initially time-windowed by a ten-hour long sliding\nwindow and fed into three Neural Networks that are used to detect the existence\nand duration of congestion events (slowdowns) in each window. The sliding\nwindow captures each slowdown event multiple times and results in increased\nconfidence in congestion detection. The training and parameter tuning are\nperformed on 17,483 hours of data that includes 168 slowdown events. This data\nis collected and labeled as part of the ongoing probe data validation studies\nat the Center for Advanced Transportation Technologies (CATT) at the University\nof Maryland. The Neural networks are carefully trained to reduce the chances of\nover-fitting to the training data. The experimental results show that this\napproach is able to successfully detect most of the congestion events, while\nsignificantly outperforming a heuristic rule-based approach. Moreover, the\nproposed approach is shown to be more accurate in estimation of the start-time\nand end-time of the congestion events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 21:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13"}

This can be explained by the $\\alpha \\beta\n\\alpha \\beta$ stacking sequence of the wurtzite crystal structure, which\nresults in steps with alternating $A$ and $B$ edge structures for the lowest\nenergy step azimuths, i.e. steps normal to $[0 1 \\bar{1} 0]$ type directions.\nPredicted differences in the adatom attachment kinetics at $A$ and $B$ steps\nwould lead to alternating $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ terrace widths. However, because\nof the difficulty of experimentally identifying which step is $A$ or $B$, it\nhas not been possible to determine the absolute difference in their behavior,\ne.g. which step has higher adatom attachment rate constants. Here we show that\nsurface X-ray scattering can measure the fraction of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$\nterraces, and thus unambiguously differentiate the growth dynamics of $A$ and\n$B$ steps.

The goal of a\nbackdoor is to corrupt the performance of the trained model on specific\nsub-tasks (e.g., by classifying green cars as frogs). A range of FL backdoor\nattacks have been introduced in the literature, but also methods to defend\nagainst them, and it is currently an open question whether FL systems can be\ntailored to be robust against backdoors. In this work, we provide evidence to\nthe contrary. We first establish that, in the general case, robustness to\nbackdoors implies model robustness to adversarial examples, a major open\nproblem in itself. Furthermore, detecting the presence of a backdoor in a FL\nmodel is unlikely assuming first order oracles or polynomial time. We couple\nour theoretical results with a new family of backdoor attacks, which we refer\nto as edge-case backdoors. An edge-case backdoor forces a model to misclassify\non seemingly easy inputs that are however unlikely to be part of the training,\nor test data, i.e., they live on the tail of the input distribution. We explain\nhow these edge-case backdoors can lead to unsavory failures and may have\nserious repercussions on fairness, and exhibit that with careful tuning at the\nside of the adversary, one can insert them across a range of machine learning\ntasks (e.g., image classification, OCR, text prediction, sentiment analysis).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 21:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13"}

While there is no clear clinical\nmanagement strategy fitting all patients, cytotoxic chemotherapy with docetaxel\nis currently regarded as the gold standard. However, tumors may regain activity\nafter treatment conclusion and become resistant to docetaxel. This situation\ncalls for new delivery strategies and drug compounds enabling an improved\ntherapeutic outcome. Combination of docetaxel with antiangiogenic therapy has\nbeen considered a promising strategy. Bevacizumab is the most common\nantiangiogenic drug, but clinical studies have not revealed a clear benefit\nfrom its combination with docetaxel. Here, we capitalize on our prior work on\nmathematical modeling of prostate cancer growth subjected to combined cytotoxic\nand antiangiogenic therapies, and propose an optimal control framework to\nrobustly compute the drug-independent cytotoxic and antiangiogenic effects\nenabling an optimal therapeutic control of tumor dynamics.

In\nmultilayer networks, these changes are triggered by error signals fed back from\nthe output, generally through a stepwise inversion of the feedforward\nprocessing steps. The gold standard for this process -- backpropagation --\nworks well in artificial neural networks, but is biologically implausible.\nSeveral recent proposals have emerged to address this problem, but many of\nthese biologically-plausible schemes are based on learning an independent set\nof feedback connections. This complicates the assignment of errors to each\nsynapse by making it dependent upon a second learning problem, and by fitting\ninversions rather than guaranteeing them. Here, we show that feedforward\nnetwork transformations can be effectively inverted through dynamics. We derive\nthis dynamic inversion from the perspective of feedback control, where the\nforward transformation is reused and dynamically interacts with fixed or random\nfeedback to propagate error signals during the backward pass. Importantly, this\nscheme does not rely upon a second learning problem for feedback because\naccurate inversion is guaranteed through the network dynamics. We map these\ndynamics onto generic feedforward networks, and show that the resulting\nalgorithm performs well on several supervised and unsupervised datasets.\nFinally, we discuss potential links between dynamic inversion and second-order\noptimization.

The exponentially growing volumes of generated data urge the\ndevelopment of several mining techniques to feed the needs for automatically\nderived knowledge.

In this paper, we introduce a clustering technique that uses game\ntheory models to tackle multi-objective application problems. The main idea is\nto exploit a specific type of simultaneous move games, called congestion games.\nCongestion games offer numerous advantages ranging from being succinctly\nrepresented to possessing Nash equilibrium that is reachable in a\npolynomial-time. The proposed algorithm has three main steps: 1) it starts by\nidentifying the initial players (or the cluster-heads), 2) it establishes the\ninitial clusters' composition by constructing the game and try to find the\nequilibrium of the game. The third step consists of merging close clusters to\nobtain the final clusters.

Statistical models make use\nof longitudinal data to capture the temporal aspect of disease progression;\nhowever, these models require prior feature extraction. Deep learning avoids\nexplicit feature extraction, meaning we can develop models for images where\nfeatures are either unknown or impossible to quantify accurately. Previous\nprognostic models using deep learning with imaging data require annotation\nduring training or only utilize a single time point. We propose a novel deep\nlearning method to predict the progression of diseases using longitudinal\nimaging data with uneven time intervals, which requires no prior feature\nextraction. Given previous images from a patient, our method aims to predict\nwhether the patient will progress onto the next stage of the disease. The\nproposed method uses InceptionV3 to produce feature vectors for each image. In\norder to account for uneven intervals, a novel interval scaling is proposed.\nFinally, a Recurrent Neural Network is used to prognosticate the disease.

They are characterised by large flow aeration, high\nturbulence and strong fluctuations of the free surface and the jump toe. For\nfree surface measurements, fast-sampling, fixed-point instruments such as\nacoustic displacement meters (ADMs) and wire gauges (WGs) are commonly used,\nwhile LIDAR technology is a relatively new method for recording instantaneous\nfree surface motions of aerated flows. While each of these instruments has been\nshown previously to provide reasonable results for basic and advanced free\nsurface properties, differences between instruments and experiments remain\nunexplained. To systematically analyse these differences, simultaneous\nlaboratory experiments of aerated hydraulic jumps were conducted. Good\nagreement between the three instruments was obtained for basic free surface\nproperties including elevations, fluctuations, skewness, kurtosis, and\nfrequencies, as well as advanced free surface properties such as integral time\nand length scales. These new results indicate that any of these instruments can\nbe used for the recording of free surface properties albeit the integration\nlimit for free surface scales must be considered. A key finding of this\nresearch was that differences between repeated experiments as well as previous\nstudies were observed when using the visual jump toe for alignment. However,\nthis bias could be resolved by using the mean jump toe location recorded with\nthe LIDAR. Therefore, future studies should simultaneously measure the\ninstantaneous jump toe to provide more consistent results across studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 01:04:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2020 08:07:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

Here, we develop the equivalent RLC\ncircuit model of such meta-atoms to estimate their second-order nonlinear\noptical parameter i.e. the first-order hyperpolarizability in the optical\nspectral range. In parallel, we extract from second-harmonic generation\nexperiments the spectrum of the 1st-order hyperpolarizabilities of individual\nmeta-atoms consisting of asymmetrically shaped (elongated) plasmonic\nnanoprisms. Moreover, we verify our results using nonlinear hydrodynamic-FDTD\nand with calculations based on nonlinear scattering theory. All three\napproaches: analytical, experimental, and computational, yield results that\nagree very well. Our empirical RLC model can thus be used as a simple tool to\nenable efficient design of nonlinear plasmonic metasurfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 02:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13"}

This overhead is substantially reduced\nwhen sparse channel estimation techniques are employed, owing to the channel\nsparsity in the angular domain. When a sparse channel estimation method is\nimplemented, the measurement matrix, which is related to the pilot matrix, is\nessential to the channel estimation performance. Existing sparse channel\nestimation schemes widely adopt random measurement matrices, which have been\ncriticized for their suboptimal reconstruction performance. This paper proposes\nnovel data-driven solutions to design the measurement matrix. Model-based\nautoencoders are customized to optimize the measurement matrix by unfolding the\nclassical basis pursuit algorithm. The obtained data-driven measurement\nmatrices are applied to existing sparse reconstruction algorithms, leading to\nflexible hybrid data-driven implementations for sparse channel estimation.\nNumerical results show that the proposed data-driven measurement matrices can\nachieve more accurate reconstructions and use fewer measurements than the\nexisting random matrices, thereby leading to a higher achievable rate for CSI\nacquisition. Moreover, compared with existing pure deep learning-based sparse\nreconstruction methods, the proposed hybrid data-driven scheme, which uses the\nnovel data-driven measurement matrices with conventional sparse reconstruction\nalgorithms, can achieve higher reconstruction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 05:52:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 08:35:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2022 08:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

In this\nwork, we study a social distancing game among the agents of a population, who\ndetermine their social interactions during the spread of an epidemic. The\ninterconnections between the agents are modeled by a network and local\ninteractions are considered. The payoffs of the agents depend on their benefits\nfrom their social interactions, as well as on the costs to their health due to\ntheir possible contamination. The information available to the agents during\nthe decision making plays a crucial role in our model. We examine two extreme\ncases. In the first case, the agents know exactly the health states of their\nneighbors and in the second they have statistical information for the global\nprevalence of the epidemic. The Nash equilibria of the games are studied and,\ninterestingly, in the second case the equilibrium strategies for an agent are\neither full isolation or no social distancing at all. Experimental studies are\npresented through simulations, where we observe that in the first case of\nperfect local information the agents can affect significantly the prevalence of\nthe epidemic with low cost for their sociability, while in the second case they\nhave to pay the burden of not being well informed.

Inspired by coupled\nspectral unmixing, a two-stream convolutional autoencoder framework is taken as\nbackbone to jointly decompose MS and HS data into a spectrally meaningful basis\nand corresponding coefficients. CUCaNet is capable of adaptively learning\nspectral and spatial response functions from HS-MS correspondences by enforcing\nreasonable consistency assumptions on the networks.

We also prove that, with $\\tau^*=2$,\nthe problem is NP-hard in bipartite graphs for fixed $k=5$, and from previous\nresults we observe that TSS-time is NP-hard in planar graphs and W[1]-hard\nparameterized by treewidth. Finally, we present a linear-time algorithm to find\na target set $S_0$ in a given tree maximizing $t_{\\tau}(S_0)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 08:46:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13"}

In the case of a slow process without\nfault, fault correction is undesirable as it can trigger new faults that could\nbe prevented with fault tolerance that is a more proactive system maintenance.\nBut in the case of an actual faulty process, fault tolerance alone without\neventually correcting persistent faults can make systems underperforming.\nMeasuring, understanding and resolving such self-healing dilemmas is a timely\nchallenge and critical requirement given the rise of distributed ledgers, edge\ncomputing, the Internet of Things in several energy, transport and health\napplications. This paper contributes a novel and general-purpose modeling of\nfault scenarios during system runtime.

Spatially resolved high-contrast observations are of particular\ninterest, since substructures in disks, linked to planet formation, can be\ndetected and close companions or even planets in formation embedded in the disk\ncan be revealed. In this study we present the first result of the DESTINYS\nsurvey (Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars). DESTINYS\nis an ESO/SPHERE large program that aims at studying disk evolution in\nscattered light, mainly focusing on a sample of low-mass stars (<1$M_\\odot$) in\nnearby (~200 pc) star-forming regions. In this particular study we present the\nobservations of the ET Cha (RECX 15) system, a nearby 'old' classical T Tauri\nstar (5-8 Myr, ~100 pc), which is still strongly accreting. We use SPHERE/IRDIS\nin H-band polarimetric imaging mode to obtain high contrast images of the ET\nCha system to search for scattered light from the circumstellar disk as well as\nthermal emission from close companions. We additionally employ VLT/NACO total\nintensity archival data taken in 2003. We report here the discovery of a\nlow-mass (sub)stellar companion with SPHERE/IRDIS to ET Cha.

We explore possible orbital solutions and discuss the\nrecent dynamic history of the system. Independent of the precise companion mass\nwe find that the presence of the companion likely explains the small size of\nthe disk around ET Cha. The small separation of the binary pair indicates that\nthe disk around the primary component is likely clearing from the outside in,\nexplaining the high accretion rate of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 09:38:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

This paper contributes to the literature\nwith a novel causal inference approach for estimating station-level\nvulnerability in metro systems. The empirical analysis is based on large-scale\ndata on historical incidents and population-level passenger demand. This\nanalysis thus obviates the need for assumptions made by previous studies on\nhuman behaviour and disruption scenarios. We develop four empirical\nvulnerability metrics based on the causal impact of disruptions on travel\ndemand, average travel speed and passenger flow distribution. Specifically, the\nproposed metrics based on the irregularity in passenger flow distribution\nextends the scope of vulnerability measurement to the entire trip distribution,\ninstead of just analysing the disruption impact on the entry or exit demand\n(that is, moments of the trip distribution). The unbiased estimates of\ndisruption impact are obtained by adopting a propensity score matching method,\nwhich adjusts for the confounding biases caused by non-random occurrence of\ndisruptions. An application of the proposed framework to the London Underground\nindicates that the vulnerability of a metro station depends on the location,\ntopology, and other characteristics. We find that, in 2013, central London\nstations are more vulnerable in terms of travel demand loss. However, the loss\nof average travel speed and irregularity in relative passenger flows reveal\nthat passengers from outer London stations suffer from longer individual delays\ndue to lack of alternative routes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 09:40:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 12:47:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 12:51:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

We define a semantics for\nthe language in terms of diffeological spaces, where the key idea is to make\nuse of a suitable partiality monad. A semantic logical relations argument,\nconstructed through a subsconing construction over diffeological spaces, yields\na correctness proof of the defined AD macro. A key insight is that, to reason\nabout differentiation at sum types, we work with relations which form sheaves.\nNext, we extend our language with term and type recursion. To model this in our\nsemantics, we introduce a new notion of space, suitable for modeling both\nrecursion and differentiation, by equipping a diffeological space with a\ncompatible $\\omega$cpo-structure. We demonstrate that our whole development\nextends to this setting. By making use of a semantic, rather than syntactic,\nlogical relations argument, we circumvent the usual technicalities of logical\nrelations techniques for type recursion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 10:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13"}

Most of them focus on reducing the number of\ntraces required for successful attacks by optimizing the modeling algorithms.\nIn previous work, relatively sufficient traces need to be used for training a\nmodel. However, in the practical profiling phase, it is difficult or impossible\nto collect sufficient traces due to the constraint of various resources. In\nthis case, the performance of profiling attacks is inefficient even if proper\nmodeling algorithms are used. In this paper, the main problem we consider is\nhow to conduct more efficient profiling attacks when sufficient profiling\ntraces cannot be obtained. To deal with this problem, we first introduce the\nConditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) in the context of\nside-channel attacks. We show that CGAN can generate new traces to enlarge the\nsize of the profiling set, which improves the performance of profiling attacks.\nFor both unprotected and protected cryptographic algorithms, we find that CGAN\ncan effectively learn the leakage of traces collected in their implementations.\nWe also apply it to different modeling algorithms.

Unlike previous privacy properties, which model the protection from\nactive adversaries as the task of making victim nodes indistinguishable in\nterms of their fingerprints with respect to all potential attackers, our new\nformulation introduces a more complete view, where the attack is countered by\njointly preventing the attacker from retrieving the set of sybil nodes, and\nfrom using these sybil nodes for re-identifying the victims.

Particularly, through the analysis of\nCOSMO-SkyMed satellite data, a detailed and updated survey is provided, for\nmonitoring the accelerating destabilization process of the Mosul dam, that\nrepresents the largest hydraulic facility of Iraq and is located on the Tigris\nriver. The destructive potential of the wave that would be generated, in the\nevent of the dam destruction, could have serious consequences. If the concern\nfor human lives comes first, the concern for cultural heritage protection is\nnot negligible, since several archaeological sites are located around the Mosul\ndam. The proposed procedure is an in-depth modal assessment based on the\nmicro-motion estimation, through a Doppler sub-apertures tracking and a\nMulti-Chromatic Analysis (MCA). The method is based initially on the Persistent\nScatterers Interferometry (PSI) that is also discussed for completeness and\nvalidation. The modal analysis has detected the presence of several areas of\nresonance that could mean the presence of cracks, and the results have shown\nthat the dam is still in a strong destabilization. Moreover, the dam appears to\nbe divided into two parts: the northern part is accelerating rapidly while the\nsouthern part is decelerating and a main crack in this north-south junction is\nfound. The estimated velocities through the PS-InSAR technique show a good\nagreement with the GNSS in-situ measurements, resulting in a very high\ncorrelation coefficient and showing how the proposed procedure works\nefficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 12:04:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13"}

This attack has only\nbeen analyzed in the realm of power consumption and EM side channels, where the\nsignals leak related to the value being processed. However, microarchitecture\nsignals have no such feature, invalidating some assumptions from previous OTA\nworks.\n  In this paper, we revisit previous OTA descriptions, proposing a generic\nframework and evaluation metrics for any side-channel signal. Our analysis\nreveals OTA features not previously considered, increasing its application\nscenarios and requiring a fresh countermeasure analysis to prevent it.\n  In this regard, we demonstrate that OTAs can work in the backward direction,\nallowing to mount an augmented projective coordinates attack with respect to\nthe proposal by Naccache, Smart and Stern (Eurocrypt 2004). This demonstrates\nthat randomizing the initial targeted algorithm state does not prevent the\nattack as believed in previous works.\n  We analyze three libraries libgcrypt, mbedTLS, and wolfSSL using two\nmicroarchitecture side channels. For the libgcrypt case, we target its EdDSA\nimplementation using Curve25519 twist curve. We obtain similar results for\nmbedTLS and wolfSSL with curve secp256r1. For each library, we execute\nextensive attack instances that are able to recover the complete scalar in all\ncases using a single trace.\n  This work demonstrates that microarchitecture online template attacks are\nalso very powerful in this scenario, recovering secret information without\nknowing a leakage model.

The generator of the proposed method models intensity and shape\nvariations using two sets of transformations, as additive intensity\ntransformations and deformation fields. Both transformations are optimized\nusing labeled as well as unlabeled examples in a semi-supervised framework. Our\nexperiments on three medical datasets, namely cardic, prostate and pancreas,\nshow that the proposed approach significantly outperforms standard augmentation\nand semi-supervised approaches for image segmentation in the limited annotation\nsetting.

To address these challenges, we propose a\ncontext-aware refinement network (CAR-Net) to refine and integrate the feature\npyramid representation generated by the UNet. Consequently, the proposed\nCAR-Net explores more discriminative contextual features and a larger receptive\nfield, which is of great importance to predict largely deformed midline.

For charged macromolecules in biological media, the\nnumber ratio of bound mono- versus di-valent ions is decisive for the desired\nfunction. A theoretical prediction of such a sorption ratio is challenging\nbecause of the competition of electrostatic (valency), ion-specific, and\nbinding saturation effects.

To this end, we\nintroduce a new laparoscopic dataset, CholecT40, consisting of 40 videos from\nthe public dataset Cholec80 in which all frames have been annotated using 128\ntriplet classes. Furthermore, we present an approach to recognize these\ntriplets directly from the video data. It relies on a module called Class\nActivation Guide (CAG), which uses the instrument activation maps to guide the\nverb and target recognition. To model the recognition of multiple triplets in\nthe same frame, we also propose a trainable 3D Interaction Space, which\ncaptures the associations between the triplet components. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the significance of these contributions via several ablation\nstudies and comparisons to baselines on CholecT40.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 14:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

We present an AGI safety\nlayer that creates a special dedicated input terminal to support the iterative\nimprovement of an AGI agent's utility function. The humans who switched on the\nagent can use this terminal to close any loopholes that are discovered in the\nutility function's encoding of agent goals and constraints, to direct the agent\ntowards new goals, or to force the agent to switch itself off. An AGI agent may\ndevelop the emergent incentive to manipulate the above utility function\nimprovement process, for example by deceiving, restraining, or even attacking\nthe humans involved. The safety layer will partially, and sometimes fully,\nsuppress this dangerous incentive. The first part of this paper generalizes\nearlier work on AGI emergency stop buttons. We aim to make the mathematical\nmethods used to construct the layer more accessible, by applying them to an MDP\nmodel. We discuss two provable properties of the safety layer, and show ongoing\nwork in mapping it to a Causal Influence Diagram (CID). In the second part, we\ndevelop full mathematical proofs, and show that the safety layer creates a type\nof bureaucratic blindness. We then present the design of a learning agent, a\ndesign that wraps the safety layer around either a known machine learning\nsystem, or a potential future AGI-level learning system. The resulting agent\nwill satisfy the provable safety properties from the moment it is first\nswitched on. Finally, we show how this agent can be mapped from its model to a\nreal-life implementation. We review the methodological issues involved in this\nstep, and discuss how these are typically resolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 14:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13"}

With the\naid of a photochemical model H2O can be used as a dynamical tracer in the\njovian stratosphere. In this paper, we aim at constraining vertical eddy\ndiffusion (Kzz) at the levels where H2O resides. We monitored the H2O\ndisk-averaged emission at 556.936 GHz with the Odin space telescope between\n2002 and 2019, covering nearly two decades. We analyzed the data with a\ncombination of 1D photochemical and radiative transfer models to constrain\nvertical eddy diffusion in the stratosphere of Jupiter. The Odin observations\nshow us that the emission of H2O has an almost linear decrease of about 40%\nbetween 2002 and 2019.We can only reproduce our time series if we increase the\nmagnitude of Kzz in the pressure range where H2O diffuses downward from 2002 to\n2019, i.e. from ~0.2 mbar to ~5 mbar. However, this modified Kzz is\nincompatible with hydrocarbon observations. We find that, even if allowance is\nmade for the initially large abundances of H2O and CO at the impact latitudes,\nthe photochemical conversion of H2O to CO2 is not sufficient to explain the\nprogressive decline of the H2O line emission, suggestive of additional loss\nmechanisms. The Kzz we derived from the Odin observations of H2O can only be\nviewed as an upper limit in the ~0.2 mbar to ~5 mbar pressure range. The\nincompatibility between the interpretations made from H2O and hydrocarbon\nobservations probably results from 1D modeling limitations. Meridional\nvariability of H2O, most probably at auroral latitudes, would need to be\nassessed and compared with that of hydrocarbons to quantify the role of auroral\nchemistry in the temporal evolution of the H2O abundance since the SL9 impacts.\nModeling the temporal evolution of SL9 species with a 2D model would be the\nnext natural step.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 14:40:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

The clusters which are typical\nstructures caused by ejection of gases from a high-pressure gas jet have a\ndiameter much smaller than the laser wavelength.

The literature contains numerous propagation algorithms, for\nmany different constraints, and common to all these propagation algorithms is\nthe notion of correctness: only values that appear in no solution to the\nrespective constraint may be removed. In this paper half-checking propagators\nare introduced, for which the only requirements are that identified solutions\n(by the propagators) are actual solutions (to the corresponding constraints),\nand that the propagators are contracting. In particular, a half-checking\npropagator may remove solutions resulting in an incomplete solving process, but\nwith the upside that (good) solutions may be found faster. Overall completeness\ncan be obtained by running half-checking propagators as one component in a\nportfolio solving process. Half-checking propagators opens up a wider variety\nof techniques to be used when designing propagation algorithms, compared to\nwhat is currently available.\n  A formal model for half-checking propagators is introduced, together with a\ndetailed description of how to support such propagators in a constraint\nprogramming system. Three general directions for creating half-checking\npropagation algorithms are introduced, and used for designing new half-checking\npropagators for the cost-circuit constraint as examples. The new propagators\nare implemented in the Gecode system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 14:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13"}

To\nachieve this, we propose a simple but powerful framework to establish an\n{\\emph{Impression Space}} upon an off-the-shelf pretrained network. This\nnetwork is referred to as the {\\emph{Template Network}} because its filters\nwill be used as templates to reconstruct images from the impression. In our\nframework, the impression space and image space are bridged by a layer-wise\nencoding and iterative decoding process.

A sample of 13\nnon-Li-rich giants (8 of them being surrounded by dust according to IRAS, WISE,\nand ISO data) was monitored alongside. When compared to the binary frequency in\na reference sample of 190 K giants (containing 17.4% of definite spectroscopic\nbinaries -- SB -- and 6.3% of possible spectroscopic binaries -- SB?), the\nbinary frequency appears normal among the Li-rich giants (2/11 definite\nbinaries plus 2 possible binaries, or 18.2% SB + 18.2% SB?), after taking\naccount of the small sample size through the hypergeometric probability\ndistribution. Therefore, there appears to be no causal relationship between Li\nenrichment and binarity. Moreover, there is no correlation between Li\nenrichment and the presence of circumstellar dust, and the only correlation\nthat could be found between Li enrichment and rapid rotation is that the most\nLi-enriched K giants appear to be fast-rotating stars. However, among the dusty\nK giants, the binary frequency is much higher (4/8 definite binaries plus 1\npossible binary).

To\nalleviate such tedious and manual effort, in this paper we propose a novel\nweakly supervised segmentation framework based on partial points annotation,\ni.e., only a small portion of nuclei locations in each image are labeled. The\nframework consists of two learning stages. In the first stage, we design a\nsemi-supervised strategy to learn a detection model from partially labeled\nnuclei locations. Specifically, an extended Gaussian mask is designed to train\nan initial model with partially labeled data. Then, selftraining with\nbackground propagation is proposed to make use of the unlabeled regions to\nboost nuclei detection and suppress false positives. In the second stage, a\nsegmentation model is trained from the detected nuclei locations in a\nweakly-supervised fashion. Two types of coarse labels with complementary\ninformation are derived from the detected points and are then utilized to train\na deep neural network. The fully-connected conditional random field loss is\nutilized in training to further refine the model without introducing extra\ncomputational complexity during inference. The proposed method is extensively\nevaluated on two nuclei segmentation datasets. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method can achieve competitive performance compared to the\nfully supervised counterpart and the state-of-the-art methods while requiring\nsignificantly less annotation effort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 15:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13"}

The agent's problem is\nto seek for optimal effort, given the compensation scheme proposed by the\nprincipal over a random horizon. Then, given the optimal agent's response, the\nprincipal determines the best compensation scheme in terms of running payment,\nretirement, and lump-sum payment at retirement. A Golden Parachute is a\nsituation where the agent ceases any effort at some positive stopping time, and\nreceives a payment afterwards, possibly under the form of a lump sum payment,\nor of a continuous stream of payments. We show that a Golden Parachute only\nexists in certain specific circumstances. This is in contrast with the results\nclaimed by Sannikov, where the only requirement is a positive agent's marginal\ncost of effort at zero. Namely, we show that there is no Golden Parachute if\nthis parameter is too large. Similarly, in the context of a concave marginal\nutility, there is no Golden Parachute if the agent's utility function has a too\nnegative curvature at zero. In the general case, we prove that an agent with\npositive reservation utility is either never retired by the principal, or\nretired above some given threshold (as in Sannikov's solution). We show that\ndifferent discount factors induce a face-lifted utility function, which allows\nto reduce the analysis to a setting similar to the equal discount rates one.\nFinally, we also confirm that an agent with small reservation utility may have\nan informational rent, meaning that the principal optimally offers him a\ncontract with strictly higher utility than his participation value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 12:50:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 09:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Strong dipolar fields considerably affect the kinetic energy\ndistribution of convective motions which enables the maintenance of this field\nconfiguration. The relative importance of each force depends on the spatial\nlength scale, whereas $Ro_\\ell$ is a global output parameter which ignores the\nspatial dependency.

In this work, we suggest a method for obtaining the equilibrium\nfluid density in a pore using DFT without calculating the free energy variation\n- Variation Free Density Functional Theory (VF-DFT). This technique is\napplicable to explore fluids with complex interactions and speed up\ncalculations for simple fluids. In VF-DFT the fluid density is represented as a\ndecomposition over a limited set of basis functions and decomposition\ncoefficients. To construct basis functions, we applied principal component\nanalysis (PCA). PCA is used to extract the main patterns of the fluid densities\nin the nanopore. Decomposition coefficients are sought with stochastic\ngradient-free optimization methods, such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle\nswarm optimization (PSO) to minimize the free energy of the system.

However, it is inevitable to obtain\nsome low-quality depth cues due to limitations of its acquisition devices,\nwhich can inhibit the SOD performance. Besides, existing methods tend to\ncombine RGB images and depth cues in a direct fusion or a simple fusion module,\nwhich makes they can not effectively exploit the complex correlations between\nthe two sources. Moreover, few methods design an appropriate module to fully\nfuse multi-level features, resulting in cross-level feature interaction\ninsufficient. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-level\nCross-modal Interaction Network (MCINet) for RGB-D based SOD. Our MCI-Net\nincludes two key components: 1) a cross-modal feature learning network, which\nis used to learn the high-level features for the RGB images and depth cues,\neffectively enabling the correlations between the two sources to be exploited;\nand 2) a multi-level interactive integration network, which integrates\nmulti-level cross-modal features to boost the SOD performance. Extensive\nexperiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our\nMCI-Net over 14 state-of-the-art methods, and validate the effectiveness of\ndifferent components in our MCI-Net. More important, our MCI-Net significantly\nimproves the SOD performance as well as has a higher FPS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 02:21:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 08:38:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

A modification of the matched field\nprocessing method is proposed, based on the transition from comparing the\nmeasured and calculated fields on the antenna to comparing their stable\ncomponents. The modified approach becomes less sensitive to the inevitable\ninaccuracies of the environmental model. In the case of a pulsed source, the\nstable components carry signals whose arrival times can be taken as input\nparameters in solving the inverse problems. The use of the stable components as\nthe initial fields on the aperture of the emitting antenna makes it possible to\nexcite narrow continuous wave beams propagating along given ray paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 13:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}
