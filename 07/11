For\nmany networks, while nodes are anonymous to outside observers, the existence of\na link between individuals implies the possibility of one node revealing\nidentifying information about its neighbor. Moreover, while the identities of\nthe accounts are likely hidden to an observer, the network of interaction\nbetween two anonymous accounts is often available. For example, in blockchain\ncryptocurrencies, transactions between two anonymous accounts are published\nopenly. Here we consider what happens if one (or more) parties in such a\nnetwork are deanonymized by an outside identity. These compromised individuals\ncould leak information about others with whom they interacted, which could then\ncascade to more and more nodes' information being revealed. We use a\npercolation framework to analyze the scenario outlined above and show for\ndifferent likelihoods of individuals possessing information on their\ncounter-parties, the fraction of accounts that can be identified and the\nidealized minimum number of steps from a deanonymized node to an anonymous node\n(a measure of the effort required to deanonymize that individual).

In particular, we define a new class of fractal\nsets of integers that parallels the notion of $\\times r$-invariant sets on the\n1-torus and investigate the additive and geometric independence between two\nsuch fractal sets when they are structured with respect to multiplicatively\nindependent bases.

It is well-understood that, in the usual mean-field scaling, full\nphase-locking is unlikely and that it is partially phase-locked states that are\nimportant in applications. Despite this, while there has been much attention\ngiven to the existence and stability of fully phase-locked states in the finite\nN Kuramoto model, the partially phase-locked states have received much less\nattention. In this paper, we present two related results. Firstly, we derive an\nanalytical criterion that, for sufficiently strong coupling, guarantees the\nexistence of a partially phase-locked state by proving the existence of an\nattracting ball around a fixed point of a subset of the oscillators. We also\nderive a larger invariant ball such that any point in it will asymptotically\nconverge to the attracting ball. Secondly, we consider the large N\n(thermodynamic) limit for the Kuramoto system with randomly distributed\nfrequencies. Using some results of De Smet and Aeyels on partial entrainment,\nwe derive a deterministic condition giving almost sure existence of a partially\nentrained state for sufficiently strong coupling when the natural frequencies\nof the individual oscillators are independent identically distributed random\nvariables, as well as upper and lower bounds on the size of the largest cluster\nof partially entrained oscillators. Interestingly in a series on numerical\nexperiments we find that the observed size of the largest entrained cluster is\npredicted extremely well by the upper bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 17:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

We found RF can predict BER with high\naccuracy, and its importance factor demonstrates which input attributes matter\nmost. These BER prediction results can also benefit other functions such as\nadaptive modulation, channel sensing, beaming selection, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 17:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13"}

SoftNER leverages\nstructural patterns like key,value pairs and tables for bootstrapping the\ntraining data. Further, we build a novel multi-task learning based BiLSTM-CRF\nmodel which leverages not just the semantic context but also the data-types for\nnamed-entity extraction. We have deployed SoftNER at Microsoft, a major cloud\nservice provider and have evaluated it on more than 2 months of cloud\nincidents. We show that the unsupervised machine learning based approach has a\nhigh precision of 0.96. Our multi-task learning based deep learning model also\noutperforms the state of the art NER models.

Within the eikonal formalism for the\ncross sections and phase shifts, the single-folded potential was obtained using\na n-$^9$Be phenomenological optical potential and microscopic projectile\ndensities. This paper is a follow-up in which we systematically study a series\nof different light and medium-mass projectile induced reactions on $^9$Be. Our\nresults confirm that the s.f. cross sections are larger than the d.f. cross\nsections and the effect increases with the projectile mass.

Comparing theoretical models with observations allows one to make key\nstep forward towards an understanding of planetary systems. It however requires\na model able to (i) predict all the necessary observable quantities (not only\nmasses and orbits, but also radii, luminosities, magnitudes, or evaporation\nrates) and (ii) address the large range in relevant planetary masses (from Mars\nmass to super-Jupiters) and distances (from stellar-grazing to wide orbits).\nMethods. We have developed a combined global end-to-end planetary formation and\nevolution model, the Generation III Bern model, based on the core accretion\nparadigm. This model solves as directly as possible the underlying differential\nequations for the structure and evolution of the gas disc, the dynamical state\nof the planetesimals, the internal structure of the planets yielding their\nplanetesimal and gas accretion rates, disc-driven orbital migration, and the\ngravitational interaction of concurrently forming planets via a full N-body\ncalculation. Importantly, the model also follows the long-term evolution of the\nplanets on Gigayear timescales after formation including the effects of cooling\nand contraction, atmospheric escape, bloating, and stellar tides. Results. To\ntest the model, we compared it with classical scenarios of Solar System\nformation. For the terrestrial planets, we find that we obtain a giant impact\nphase provided enough embryos (~100) are initially emplaced in the disc. For\nthe giant planets, we find that Jupiter-mass planets must accrete their core\nshortly before the dispersal of the gas disc to prevent strong inward migration\nthat would bring them to the inner edge of the disc. Conclusions. The model can\nform planetary systems with a wide range of properties. We find that systems\nwith only terrestrial planets are often well-ordered while giant-planet bearing\nsystems show no such similarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 18:31:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 13:52:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 08:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

The properties of giant\nplanets do not change much as long as there are at least 10 embryos in each\nsystem.

Denoting the position and velocity by $x$\nand $v$ respectively, we consider two different resetting protocols - (i)\ncomplete resetting: here both $x$ and $v$ reset to their initial values $x_0$\nand $v_0$ at a constant rate $r$, (ii) partial resetting: here only $x$ resets\nto $x_0$ while $v$ evolves without interruption. For complete resetting, we\nfind that the particle attains stationary state in both $x$ and $v$. We compute\nthe non-equilibrium joint stationary state of $x$ and $v$ and also study the\nlate time relaxation of the distribution function. On the other hand, for\npartial resetting, the joint distribution is always in the transient state. At\nlarge $t$, the position distribution possesses a scaling behaviour $(x/\n\\sqrt{t})$ which we rigorously derive. Next, we study the first passage time\nproperties with an absorbing wall at the origin. For complete resetting, we\nfind that the mean first passage time is rendered finite by the resetting\nmechanism. We explicitly derive the expressions for the mean first passage time\nand the survival probability at large $t$. However, in stark contrast, for\npartial resetting, we find that resetting does not render finite mean first\npassage time. This is because even though $x$ is brought to $x_0$, the large\nfluctuation in $v$ ($\\sim \\sqrt{t}$) can take the particle substantially far\nfrom the origin.

By focusing on a set of canonical finite size solid\nstate systems, we show that both QMC methods can be made to systematically\nconverge towards the same energy once basis set effects and systematic biases\nhave been removed. AFQMC shows a much smaller dependence on the trial\nwavefunction than DMC while simultaneously exhibiting a much larger basis set\ndependence. We outline some of the remaining challenges and opportunities for\nimproving these approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 19:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Sufficiently large miners can perform selfish mining -\ndeviate from the protocol to gain more than their fair share. Such systems are\nthus secure if all miners are smaller than a threshold size so their best\nresponse is following the protocol.\n  To find the threshold, one has to identify the optimal strategy for miners of\ndifferent sizes, i.e., solve a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, because\nof the PoW difficulty adjustment mechanism, the miners' utility is a non-linear\nratio function.

In this paper, we report\ncharacterizations of radial PN junctions that consist of p-type Si micropillars\ncreated by deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) and an n-type layer formed by\nphosphorus gas diffusion. We use electron-beam induced current (EBIC)\nmicroscopy to access the 3D junction profile from the sidewall of the pillars.\nOur EBIC images reveal uniform PN junctions conformally constructed on the 3D\npillar array.

We find the EBIC efficiency of the pillar array increases with the\nincident electron beam energy, consistent with the EBIC behaviors observed in a\nhigh-quality planar PN junction. The magnitude of the EBIC efficiency of our\npillar array is about 70 % at 10 kV, slightly lower than that of the planar\ndevice (about 81 %). We suggest that this reduction could be attributed to the\nunpassivated pillar surface and the unintended recombination centers in the\npillar cores introduced during the DRIE processes.

In this paper, a model predictive control\nstrategy is introduced that not only stabilizes the power produced by wind\nfarms, but also creates the possibility to perform power reference tracking\nwith wind farms. With power reference tracking, it is possible for grid\noperators to adapt the power production to a change in the power demand and to\ncounteract fluctuations that are introduced by other power generators. In this\nway, wind farms can actually contribute to the stabilization of the power grid\nwhen this is necessary instead of negatively influencing it. A low-fidelity\ncontrol-oriented wind farm model is developed and employed in the developed\ndistributed model predictive controller. In this control model, the wake\ndynamics are taken into account and consequently, the model's order is\nrelatively large. This makes it, from a computational point of view,\nchallenging for a centralized model predictive control to provide real-time\ncontrol for large wind farms. Therefore, the controller proposed in this paper\nis a distributed model predictive control.

However, the gain in speed for these\npruned models is often overlooked in the literature due to the complex nature\nof latency measurements. In this paper, we show the limitation of filter\npruning methods in terms of latency reduction and propose LayerPrune framework.\nLayerPrune presents a set of layer pruning methods based on different criteria\nthat achieve higher latency reduction than filter pruning methods on similar\naccuracy. The advantage of layer pruning over filter pruning in terms of\nlatency reduction is a result of the fact that the former is not constrained by\nthe original model's depth and thus allows for a larger range of latency\nreduction. For each filter pruning method we examined, we use the same filter\nimportance criterion to calculate a per-layer importance score in one-shot. We\nthen prune the least important layers and fine-tune the shallower model which\nobtains comparable or better accuracy than its filter-based pruning\ncounterpart. This one-shot process allows to remove layers from single path\nnetworks like VGG before fine-tuning, unlike in iterative filter pruning, a\nminimum number of filters per layer is required to allow for data flow which\nconstraint the search space.

In these assays,\nthe error frequency is indirectly estimated by using the steady-state or the\ntransient-state kinetic theory combined with the measured kinetic rates.\nHowever, whether these indirectly estimated fidelities are equivalent to the\ntrue fidelity has never been clarified theoretically, and in particular there\nare different strategies to quantify the proofreading efficiency of DNAP but\noften lead to inconsistent results.

However, meta-learning approaches essentially learn\nacross a variety of few-shot tasks and thus still require large-scale training\ndata with fine-grained supervision to derive a generalized model, thereby\ninvolving prohibitive annotation cost. In this paper, we advance the few-shot\nclassification paradigm towards a more challenging scenario, i.e.,\ncross-granularity few-shot classification, where the model observes only coarse\nlabels during training while is expected to perform fine-grained classification\nduring testing. This task largely relieves the annotation cost since\nfine-grained labeling usually requires strong domain-specific expertise. To\nbridge the cross-granularity gap, we approximate the fine-grained data\ndistribution by greedy clustering of each coarse-class into pseudo-fine-classes\naccording to the similarity of image embeddings. We then propose a\nmeta-embedder that jointly optimizes the visual- and semantic-discrimination,\nin both instance-wise and coarse class-wise, to obtain a good feature space for\nthis coarse-to-fine pseudo-labeling process. Extensive experiments and ablation\nstudies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our\napproach on three representative datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2020 03:44:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 02:46:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 12:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

Here, a theoretical model for\nmagnon-bipolar carrier drag thermopower is derived based on the magnon-carrier\ninteraction lifetimes.

Electric currents flowing through\none ribbon are highly correlated with those through the other, therefore\nbelonging to the same current system. The non-neutrality factor of this current\nsystem is independent of the flare magnitude, implying that both direct and\nreturn currents participate in flares. J-shaped flares are distinct from\nnon-J-shaped flares in the following aspects: 1) Electric current densities\nwithin J-shaped SRA are significantly smaller than those within non-J-shaped\nSRA, but J-shaped SRA and its associated magnetic flux are also significantly\nlarger. 2) Electric currents through SRA are positively correlated with the\nflare magnitude, but J-shaped flares show stronger correlation than\nnon-J-shaped flares. 3) The majority (75\\%) of J-shaped flares are eruptive,\nwhile the majority (86\\%) of non-J-shaped flares are confined; accordingly,\nhosting active regions of J-shaped flares are more likely to be sigmoidal than\nnon-J-shaped flares. Thus, J-shaped flares constitute a distinct subset of\ntwo-ribbon flares, probably the representative of eruptive ones. Further, we\nfound that combining SRA and its associated magnetic flux has the potential to\ndifferentiate eruptive from confined flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2020 06:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

It is meaningful to observe that the maximum concentration decays much\nfaster in VD SBI than in PS SBI regardless of the shock Mach number (Ma = 1.22\n~ 4). The quasi-Lamb-Oseen type velocity distribution in the PS SBI is found by\nanalyzing the azimuthal velocity that stretches the bubble. Meanwhile, for the\nVD SBI, an additional stretching enhanced by the secondary baroclinic vorticity\n(SBV) production contributes to the faster-mixing decay. The underlying\nmechanism of the SBV-enhanced stretching is further revealed through the\ndensity and velocity difference between the shocked light bubble and the heavy\nambient air.

However, in the dense inner regions\nwhere this mechanism is usually most efficient, the existence of dust grains\nwith sizes ranging from nanometres to millimetres has been confirmed.\nAdditionally, the presence of gas forces larger grains to migrate vertically\ntowards the disk midplane, introducing a dust segregation in the vertical\ndirection.

Another interesting question addressed is what makes the\ndeep-learning model decide in a particular fashion, which can further help in\ndemystifying the mechanism of action of certain perturbations and paves a way\ntowards the explainability of the deep-learning model.\n  We show the results of Grad-CAM visualizations and make a case for the\nsignificance of certain features over others.

After having given an overview of the main\napproaches, I will propose a re-interpretation of frequentist probability. Most\nstatisticians are aware that probability models interpreted in a frequentist\nmanner are not really true in objective reality, but only idealisations. I\nargue that this is often ignored when actually applying frequentist methods and\ninterpreting the results, and that keeping up the awareness for the essential\ndifference between reality and models can lead to a more appropriate use and\ninterpretation of frequentist models and methods, called\n\"frequentism-as-model\". This is elaborated showing connections to existing\nwork, appreciating the special role of independently and identically\ndistributed observations and subject matter knowledge, giving an account of how\nand under what conditions models that are not true can be useful, giving\ndetailed interpretations of tests and confidence intervals, confronting their\nimplicit compatibility logic with the inverse probability logic of Bayesian\ninference, re-interpreting the role of model assumptions, appreciating\nrobustness, and the role of \"interpretative equivalence\" of models.

The use of super twisting algorithm (STA)\neliminates the chattering problem encountered in traditional sliding mode\ncontrol while retaining its robustness properties.

However, there\nstill are two issues in such design: scale limitation and feature similarity.\nFurther performance improvements are thus restricted. In this paper, we propose\na novel crowd counting framework called Pyramid Scale Network (PSNet) to\nexplicitly address these issues. Specifically, for scale limitation, we adopt\nthree Pyramid Scale Modules (PSM) to efficiently capture multi-scale features,\nwhich integrate a message passing mechanism and an attention mechanism into\nmulti-column architecture. Moreover, for feature similarity, a novel loss\nfunction named Multi-column variance loss is introduced to make the features\nlearned by each column in PSM appropriately different from each other.

However, the formulation of efficient and\nhigh-performance learning algorithms for SNNs is still challenging. Most\nexisting learning methods learn weights only, and require manual tuning of the\nmembrane-related parameters that determine the dynamics of a single spiking\nneuron. These parameters are typically chosen to be the same for all neurons,\nwhich limits the diversity of neurons and thus the expressiveness of the\nresulting SNNs. In this paper, we take inspiration from the observation that\nmembrane-related parameters are different across brain regions, and propose a\ntraining algorithm that is capable of learning not only the synaptic weights\nbut also the membrane time constants of SNNs. We show that incorporating\nlearnable membrane time constants can make the network less sensitive to\ninitial values and can speed up learning.

The specification and tuning of a single\nreward function is a tedious task and does not generalize over a large set of\ntraffic situations. Deep learning approaches based on path integral inverse\nreinforcement learning have been successfully applied to predict local\nsituation-dependent reward functions using features of a set of sampled driving\npolicies. Sample-based trajectory planning algorithms are able to approximate a\nspatio-temporal subspace of feasible driving policies that can be used to\nencode the context of a situation. However, the interaction with dynamic\nobjects requires an extended planning horizon, which depends on sequential\ncontext modeling. In this work, we are concerned with the sequential reward\nprediction over an extended time horizon. We present a neural network\narchitecture that uses a policy attention mechanism to generate a\nlow-dimensional context vector by concentrating on trajectories with a\nhuman-like driving style. Apart from this, we propose a temporal attention\nmechanism to identify context switches and allow for stable adaptation of\nrewards. We evaluate our results on complex simulated driving situations,\nincluding other moving vehicles. Our evaluation shows that our policy attention\nmechanism learns to focus on collision-free policies in the configuration\nspace. Furthermore, the temporal attention mechanism learns persistent\ninteraction with other vehicles over an extended planning horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2020 15:25:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2020 08:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

We provide theoretical\nlower bounds to the probe dimension and show that a qubit probe can perfectly\nextract information from any multi-dimensional quantum system. Furthermore, we\ncompare the repeated measurement scheme, in which a pointer repeatedly measures\nthe system of interest, to the repeated contact scheme, in which the pointer\nrepeatedly stores information of the measured observable and is measured only\nat the end of the protocol. Here, we find that in most cases the repeated\ncontact scheme has a higher observational entropy implying that the observer\ncan extract the most amount of quantum information using this scheme. Finally,\nwe discuss observational entropy as a tool for quantum state inference. Further\ndeveloped, this could find wide applications in quantum information processing\nand help determine the best read-out procedures from quantum memories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2020 07:31:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 16:53:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 05:55:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 07:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

In recent years, network\ninterventionists have suggested that these failures could be attributed to PCA\nselection procedures. The change agents themselves who are selected to do the\nPCA work can often be as important as the messages they convey. To address this\nconcern, we tested a new PCA intervention for YEH, with three arms: (1) an arm\nusing an artificial intelligence (AI) planning algorithm to select PCA, (2) a\npopularity arm--the standard PCA approach--operationalized as highest degree\ncentrality (DC), and (3) an observation only comparison group (OBS). PCA models\nthat promote HIV testing, HIV knowledge, and condom use are efficacious for\nYEH. Both the AI and DC arms showed improvements over time. AI-based PCA\nselection led to better outcomes and increased the speed of intervention\neffects. Specifically, the changes in behavior observed in the AI arm occurred\nby 1 month, but not until 3 months in the DC arm. Given the transient nature of\nYEH and the high risk for HIV infection, more rapid intervention effects are\ndesirable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2020 02:17:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-16"}

However, the extreme computational effort\nassociated with computing a nested micromodel at every macroscopic integration\npoint makes FE2 prohibitive for most practical applications. Constructing\nsurrogate models able to efficiently compute the microscopic constitutive\nresponse is therefore a promising approach in enabling concurrent multiscale\nmodeling. This work presents a reduction framework for adaptively constructing\nsurrogate models based on statistical learning. The nested micromodels are\nreplaced by a machine learning surrogate model based on Gaussian Processes\n(GP). The need for offline data collection is bypassed by training the GP\nmodels online based on data coming from a small set of fully-solved anchor\nmicromodels that undergo the same strain history as their associated macro\nintegration points. The Bayesian formalism inherent to GP models provides a\nnatural tool for uncertainty estimation through which new observations or\ninclusion of new anchors are triggered. The surrogate constitutive manifold is\nconstructed with as few micromechanical evaluations as possible by enhancing\nthe GP models with gradient information and the solution scheme is made robust\nthrough a greedy data selection approach embedded within the conventional\nfinite element solution loop for nonlinear analysis. The sensitivity to model\nparameters is studied with a tapered bar example with plasticity, while the\napplicability of the model to more complex cases is demonstrated with the\nelastoplastic analysis of a plate with multiple cutouts and a crack growth\nexample for mixed-mode bending. Significant efficiency gains are obtained\nwithout resorting to offline training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2020 10:29:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-16"}

Method: Two empirical research\nmethods were used. Initially, we conducted an SM to identify the available and\nrelevant studies on the use of secondary studies as a research methodology for\nconducting SE research projects. Secondly, a survey was performed with 64 SE\nresearchers to identify their perception related to the value of performing\nsecondary studies to support their research projects.

The variation of multifractal\ndimensions, Dq and multifractal spectral function, f($\\alpha$q) with order of\nthe moments, q have been studied thoroughly. Dq is found to decrease with\nincreasing order of the moments, q indicating thereby a self-similar behaviour\nin the multiparticle production in the considered collisions.
