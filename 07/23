Previous work has investigated training models with\ndifferential privacy (DP) guarantees through adding DP noise to the gradients.\nHowever, such solutions (specifically, DPSGD), result in large degradations in\nthe accuracy of the trained models. In this paper, we aim at training deep\nlearning models with DP guarantees while preserving model accuracy much better\nthan previous works. Our key technique is to encode gradients to map them to a\nsmaller vector space, therefore enabling us to obtain DP guarantees for\ndifferent noise distributions.

Turbulence randomises the\norientations to some extent, and this affects the reflection patterns of\npolarised light from turbulent clouds containing ice crystals. An overdamped\ntheory predicts that turbulence-induced fluctuations of the orientation are\nvery small when the settling number Sv (a dimensionless measure of the settling\nspeed) is large. At small Sv, by contrast, the overdamped theory predicts that\nturbulence randomises the orientations. This overdamped theory neglects the\neffect of particle inertia.

Items arrive sequentially, but\nupon arrival an item's actual size is unknown; only its probabilistic\ninformation is available to the decision maker. Without knowing this size, the\ndecision maker must irrevocably pack the item into an available bin or place it\nin a new bin. Once packed in a bin, the decision maker observes the item's\nactual size, and overflowing the bin is a possibility. An overflow incurs a\nlarge penalty cost and the corresponding bin is unusable for the rest of the\nprocess. In practical terms, this overflow models delayed services, failure of\nservers, and/or loss of end-user goodwill. The objective is to minimize the\ntotal expected cost given by the sum of the number of opened bins and the\noverflow penalty cost. We present an online algorithm with expected cost at\nmost a constant factor times the cost incurred by the optimal packing policy\nwhen item sizes are drawn from an i.i.d. sequence of unknown length.

A typical\ntext-to-speech system converts a language text into a waveform. There exist\nmany English TTS systems that produce mature, natural, and human-like speech\nsynthesizers. In contrast, other languages, including Arabic, have not been\nconsidered until recently. Existing Arabic speech synthesis solutions are slow,\nof low quality, and the naturalness of synthesized speech is inferior to the\nEnglish synthesizers. They also lack essential speech key factors such as\nintonation, stress, and rhythm. Different works were proposed to solve those\nissues, including the use of concatenative methods such as unit selection or\nparametric methods. However, they required a lot of laborious work and domain\nexpertise. Another reason for such poor performance of Arabic speech\nsynthesizers is the lack of speech corpora, unlike English that has many\npublicly available corpora and audiobooks. This work describes how to generate\nhigh quality, natural, and human-like Arabic speech using an end-to-end neural\ndeep network architecture.

The direct configuration can\nachieve higher data rates without such frequent launches by increasing\nterrestrial collector area.

Recent studies have\ndemonstrated promising results by learning scene representations that\nimplicitly encode both geometry and appearance without 3D supervision. However,\nexisting approaches in practice often show blurry renderings caused by the\nlimited network capacity or the difficulty in finding accurate intersections of\ncamera rays with the scene geometry. Synthesizing high-resolution imagery from\nthese representations often requires time-consuming optical ray marching. In\nthis work, we introduce Neural Sparse Voxel Fields (NSVF), a new neural scene\nrepresentation for fast and high-quality free-viewpoint rendering. NSVF defines\na set of voxel-bounded implicit fields organized in a sparse voxel octree to\nmodel local properties in each cell. We progressively learn the underlying\nvoxel structures with a differentiable ray-marching operation from only a set\nof posed RGB images.

The main object of study is the LocalHamiltonian\nproblem, which is concerned with estimating the ground-state energy of a local\nHamiltonian and is complete for the class QMA, a quantum generalization of the\nclass NP. A major challenge in the field is to understand the complexity of the\nLocalHamiltonian problem in more physically natural parameter regimes. One\ncrucial parameter in understanding the ground space of any Hamiltonian in\nmany-body physics is the spectral gap, which is the difference between the\nsmallest two eigenvalues. Despite its importance in quantum many-body physics,\nthe role played by the spectral gap in the complexity of the LocalHamiltonian\nis less well-understood. In this work, we make progress on this question by\nconsidering the precise regime, in which one estimates the ground-state energy\nto within inverse exponential precision. Computing ground-state energies\nprecisely is a task that is important for quantum chemistry and quantum\nmany-body physics.\n  In the setting of inverse-exponential precision, there is a surprising result\nthat the complexity of LocalHamiltonian is magnified from QMA to PSPACE, the\nclass of problems solvable in polynomial space. We clarify the reason behind\nthis boost in complexity. Specifically, we show that the full complexity of the\nhigh precision case only comes about when the spectral gap is exponentially\nsmall. As a consequence of the proof techniques developed to show our results,\nwe uncover important implications for the representability and circuit\ncomplexity of ground states of local Hamiltonians, the theory of uniqueness of\nquantum witnesses, and techniques for the amplification of quantum witnesses in\nthe presence of postselection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 20:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

This process leads to the shrinkage of the binary orbit\nover time, and is important in a variety of astrophysical contexts including\nthe orbital evolution of stellar binaries, the migration of planets in\nprotoplanetary discs, and the evolution of black hole binaries (stellar and\nsupermassive). The merger of compact object binaries provides a source of\ngravitational waves in the Universe. Recently, several groups have reported\nnumerical simulations of circumbinary discs that yield the opposite result,\nfinding that the binary expands with time. Here we argue that this result is\nprimarily due to the choice of simulation parameters, made for numerical\nreasons, which differ from realistic disc parameters in many cases. We provide\nphysical arguments, and then demonstrate with 3D hydrodynamical simulations,\nthat thick (high pressure, high viscosity) discs drive sufficient accretion of\nhigh angular momentum material to force binary expansion, while in the more\nrealistic case of thin (low pressure, low viscosity) discs there is less\naccretion and the binary shrinks. In the latter case, tides, which generally\ntransfer angular momentum and energy from the more rapidly rotating object (the\nbinary) to the less rapidly rotating object (the disc), are the dominant driver\nof disc-binary evolution. This causes the binary to shrink. We therefore\nconclude that for common circumbinary disc parameters, binaries with\nnon-extreme mass ratios are expected to shrink over time. Expansion of the\nbinary can occur if the disc viscosity is unusually high, which may occur in\nthe very thick discs encountered in e.g. circumplanetary discs, super-Eddington\nAGN, or the outer regions of passive protostellar discs that are heated by the\n...

In\nthis work, we present Tiny-Transfer-Learning (TinyTL) for memory-efficient\non-device learning. TinyTL freezes the weights while only learns the bias\nmodules, thus no need to store the intermediate activations. To maintain the\nadaptation capacity, we introduce a new memory-efficient bias module, the lite\nresidual module, to refine the feature extractor by learning small residual\nfeature maps adding only 3.8% memory overhead. Extensive experiments show that\nTinyTL significantly saves the memory (up to 6.5x) with little accuracy loss\ncompared to fine-tuning the full network. Compared to fine-tuning the last\nlayer, TinyTL provides significant accuracy improvements (up to 34.1%) with\nlittle memory overhead. Furthermore, combined with feature extractor\nadaptation, TinyTL provides 7.3-12.9x memory saving without sacrificing\naccuracy compared to fine-tuning the full Inception-V3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 18:39:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 17:51:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 18:24:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 03:16:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2021 01:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

In such\nscenarios, cross-lingual transfer has improved multi-character NNLM performance\nby allowing information transfer from a source to the target language. In the\nsame vein, we propose to use cross-lingual transfer for character NNLMs applied\nto low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, applying\ncross-lingual transfer to character NNLMs is not as straightforward. We observe\nthat relatedness of the source language plays an important role in\ncross-lingual pretraining of character NNLMs. We evaluate this aspect on ASR\ntasks for two target languages: Finnish (with English and Estonian as source)\nand Swedish (with Danish, Norwegian, and English as source).

Regardless of their architecture, one of the\nfundamental requirements of all these systems is to spatially partition the\ndata efficiently across machines. The core challenges of big spatial\npartitioning are building high spatial quality partitions while simultaneously\ntaking advantages of distributed processing models by providing load balanced\npartitions. Previous works on big spatial partitioning are to reuse existing\nindex search trees as-is, e.g., the R-tree family, STR, Kd-tree, and Quad-tree,\nby building a temporary tree for a sample of the input and use its leaf nodes\nas partition boundaries.

This appealing property allows R*-Grove to outperform\nexisting techniques in spatial query processing. R*-Grove can be easily\nintegrated into any big data platforms such as Apache Spark or Apache Hadoop.\nOur experiments show that R*-Grove outperforms the existing partitioning\ntechniques for big spatial data systems.

Thus, the present Chapter serves as a stepping stone towards gaining\nfamiliarity with more complex nonlinear constructions.\n  After recalling the equivalent defining properties of harmonic functions, we\nintroduce the ball walk. This is an infinite horizon discrete process, in which\nat each step the particle, initially placed at some point $x_0$ in the open,\nbounded domain $\\mathcal{D}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^N$, is randomly advanced to a new\nposition, uniformly distributed within the following open ball: centered at the\ncurrent placement, and with radius equal to the minimum of the parameter\n$\\epsilon$ and the distance from the boundary $\\partial\\mathcal{D}$.

We address this problem\nfor the confining potential with a singular term, viz.,\n$V_{z}(z)=2z^{2}+\\zeta^{2}/z^{2}$, with constant $\\zeta$. A quantum phase\ntransition is induced by the latter term, between the ground state (GS) of the\nharmonic oscillator and the 3D condensate split in two parallel non-interacting\nlayers, which is a manifestation of the \"superselection\" effect.

The\nreduction of the full 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) to the 2D\nnonpolynomial Schr\\\"odinger equation (NPSE) is based on the factorized ansatz,\nwith the $z$-dependent multiplier represented by an exact GS solution of the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation with potential $V(z)$.

A distributed\nfinite-time protocol-based solution is adopted that allows each DER in the\nnetwork to determine power reference commands. The distributed protocol\nrespects information exchange constraints posed by a communication network\nlayer while being robust to delays in the communications channels. The proposed\nframework enables coordinated response and control of the aggregated DERs by\napportioning the share of generation that each DER needs to provide towards\nmeeting any specified global SFR command while allowing for adjustments due to\nvariability in generation and demand in order to prioritize renewable energy\nsources in the network. A novel early dispatch mechanism with brown start is\nsynthesized to achieve initial DER response to changing SFR commands that is\nfaster than state-of-the-art distributed approaches. The proposed power\napportioning protocol is validated using an end-to-end power\nhardware-in-the-loop configuration at a distribution system scale with 40+\nphysical hardware DERs, underlying 7-MW power system model, a 250-DER\ncommunication topology with physical and simulated distributed controller\nnodes, varied communication protocols, and an underlying real-world power\nsystem model.

Even if one is not convinced that it is the best way to make\nsense of thermodynamics as it is practiced, it should be non-controversial that\n$\\Theta \\Delta^{cs}$ is a legitimate science. An upshot of the discussion is a\nclarification of the roles of the Gibbs and von Neumann entropies. Given the\ndefinition of statistical thermo-dynamic entropy, it can be proven that, under\nthe assumption of availability of thermodynamically reversible processes, these\nfunctions are the unique (up to an additive constant) functions that represent\nthermo-dynamic entropy. Light is also shed on the use of coarse-grained\nentropies.}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 00:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Though the sum-MSE minimization problem is non-convex and\nits direct solution intractable, we optimally solve this problem via\nequivalently solving a sequence of convex second-order cone program feasibility\nproblems together with a bisection search. Next, we consider distributed power\ncontrol in the other scenario without a centralized controller, for which an\nalternative IT-based method is proposed to characterize the same MSE Pareto\nboundary, and enable a decentralized power control algorithm. Accordingly, each\nAP only needs to individually control the power of its associated devices, but\nsubject to a set of IT constraints on their interference to neighboring cells,\nwhile different APs can cooperate in iteratively updating the IT levels by\npairwise information exchange, to achieve a Pareto-optimal MSE tuple.

There are often large contributions from the UV dynamics of\nthe composite resonances to the Higgs potential, and tuning between the\nquadratic term and the quartic term is required to separate the electroweak\nbreaking scale and the compositeness scale. We consider a composite Higgs model\nbased on the $SU(6)/Sp(6)$ coset, where an enhanced symmetry on the fermion\nresonances can minimize the Higgs quadratic term. Moreover, a Higgs quartic\nterm from the collective symmetry breaking of the little Higgs mechanism can be\nrealized by the partial compositeness couplings between elementary Standard\nModel fermions and the composite operators, without introducing new elementary\nfields beyond the Standard Model and the composite sector. The model contains\ntwo Higgs doublets, as well as several additional pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone\nbosons. To avoid tuning, the extra Higgs bosons are expected to be relatively\nlight and may be probed in the future LHC runs.

The underlying population dynamics is governed\nby a Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov equation with a harvesting term and\nspace-dependent coefficients while the control consists of transporting\nindividuals from a natural reserve. The nonlinear optimal control problem is\napproximated by means of a Galerkin scheme. Convergence result about the\noptimal controlled solutions and error estimates between the corresponding\noptimal controls, are derived. For certain parameter regimes, nearly optimal\nsolutions are calculated from a simple logistic ordinary differential equation\n(ODE) with a harvesting term, obtained as a Galerkin approximation of the\noriginal partial differential equation (PDE) model. A critical allowable\nfraction $\\underline{\\alpha}$ of the reserve's population is inferred from the\nreduced logistic ODE with a harvesting term. This estimate obtained from the\nreduced model allows us to distinguish sharply between survival and extinction\nfor the full PDE itself, and thus to declare whether a control strategy leads\nto success or failure for the corresponding rescue operation while ensuring\nsurvival in the reserve's population. In dynamical terms, this result\nillustrates that although continuous dependence on the forcing may hold on\nfinite-time intervals, a high sensitivity in the system's response may occur in\nthe asymptotic time.

Outbreaks in\nU.S. nursing homes have persisted despite nationwide visitor restrictions\nbeginning in mid-March. An early report issued by the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention identified staff members working in multiple nursing\nhomes as a likely source of spread from the Life Care Center in Kirkland,\nWashington to other skilled nursing facilities. The full extent of staff\nconnections between nursing homes---and the crucial role these connections\nserve in spreading a highly contagious respiratory infection---is currently\nunknown given the lack of centralized data on cross-facility nursing home\nemployment. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale analysis of nursing\nhome connections via shared staff using device-level geolocation data from 30\nmillion smartphones, and find that 7 percent of smartphones appearing in a\nnursing home also appeared in at least one other facility---even after visitor\nrestrictions were imposed. We construct network measures of nursing home\nconnectedness and estimate that nursing homes have, on average, connections\nwith 15 other facilities. Controlling for demographic and other factors, a\nhome's staff-network connections and its centrality within the greater network\nstrongly predict COVID-19 cases.

With the rise of virtual\nreality, there is a demand for recording and recreating real-world experiences\nin a way that allows for the user to interact and move within the reproduction.\nConventional sound field translation techniques take a recording and expand it\ninto an equivalent environment of virtual sources. However, the finite sampling\nof a commercial higher order microphone produces an acoustic sweet-spot in the\nvirtual reproduction.

In photonics, Rabi oscillation can be mimicked by\napplying a weak longitudinal periodic modulation to the refractive index change\nof the system. However, the Rabi oscillation of nonlinear states has yet to be\ndiscussed. We report Rabi oscillations of azimuthons---spatially modulated\nvortex solitons---in weakly nonlinear waveguides with different symmetries,\nboth numerically and theoretically. The period of Rabi oscillation can be\ndetermined by applying the coupled mode theory, which largely depends on the\nmodulation strength. Whether the Rabi oscillation between two states can be\nobtained or not is determined by the spatial symmetry of the azimuthons and the\nmodulating potential.

The highly\npublicized vulnerability uses speculative execution to learn victim secrets by\nchanging cache state. As a result, recent computer architecture research has\nfocused on invisible speculation mechanisms that attempt to block changes in\ncache state due to speculative execution. Prior work has shown significant\nsuccess in preventing Spectre and other vulnerabilities at modest performance\ncosts. In this paper, we introduce speculative interference attacks, which show\nthat prior invisible speculation mechanisms do not fully block these\nspeculation-based attacks. We make two key observations. First, misspeculated\nyounger instructions can change the timing of older, bound-to-retire\ninstructions, including memory operations. Second, changing the timing of a\nmemory operation can change the order of that memory operation relative to\nother memory operations, resulting in persistent changes to the cache state.\nUsing these observations, we demonstrate (among other attack variants) that\nsecret information accessed by mis-speculated instructions can change the order\nof bound-to-retire loads. Load timing changes can therefore leave\nsecret-dependent changes in the cache, even in the presence of invisible\nspeculation mechanisms. We show that this problem is not easy to fix:\nSpeculative interference converts timing changes to persistent cache-state\nchanges, and timing is typically ignored by many cache-based defenses. We\ndevelop a framework to understand the attack and demonstrate concrete\nproof-of-concept attacks against invisible speculation mechanisms. We provide\nsecurity definitions sufficient to block speculative interference attacks;\ndescribe a simple defense mechanism with a high performance cost; and discuss\nhow future research can improve its performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 06:36:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 20:19:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2020 23:41:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 16:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

A major\nchallenge in this context is how to efficiently interpret multi-modal\ninformation in complex environments. This has motivated numerous studies on\nlearning unsupervised representations from multi-modal data streams. These\nstudies aim to understand higher-level contextual information (e.g., a Twitter\nmessage) by jointly learning embeddings for the lower-level semantic units in\ndifferent modalities (e.g., text, user, and location of a Twitter message).\nHowever, these methods directly associate each low-level semantic unit with a\ncontinuous embedding vector, which results in high memory requirements. Hence,\ndeploying and continuously learning such models in low-memory devices (e.g.,\nmobile devices) becomes a problem. To address this problem, we present METEOR,\na novel MEmory and Time Efficient Online Representation learning technique,\nwhich: (1) learns compact representations for multi-modal data by sharing\nparameters within semantically meaningful groups and preserves the\ndomain-agnostic semantics; (2) can be accelerated using parallel processes to\naccommodate different stream rates while capturing the temporal changes of the\nunits; and (3) can be easily extended to capture implicit/explicit external\nknowledge related to multi-modal data streams.

Novel algorithmic properties and\nparadigms have been identified and studied. Our work stems from the observation\nthat selfishness is different from rationality; agents will attempt to\nstrategize whenever they perceive it to be convenient according to their\nimperfect rationality. Recent work has focused on a particular notion of\nimperfect rationality, namely absence of contingent reasoning skills, and\ndefined obvious strategyproofness (OSP) as a way to deal with the selfishness\nof these agents. Essentially, this definition states that to care for the\nincentives of these agents, we need not only pay attention about the\nrelationship between input and output, but also about the way the algorithm is\nrun. However, it is not clear what algorithmic approaches must be used for OSP.\nIn this paper, we show that, for binary allocation problems, OSP is fully\ncaptured by a combination of two well-known algorithmic techniques: forward and\nreverse greedy. We call two-way greedy this algorithmic design paradigm. Our\nmain technical contribution establishes the connection between OSP and two-way\ngreedy. We build upon the recently introduced cycle monotonicity technique for\nOSP. By means of novel structural properties of cycles and queries of OSP\nmechanisms, we fully characterize these mechanisms in terms of extremal\nimplementations. These are protocols that ask each agent to consistently\nseparate one extreme of their domain at the current history from the rest.\nThrough the connection with the greedy paradigm, we are able to import a host\nof approximation bounds to OSP and strengthen the strategic properties of this\nfamily of algorithms. Finally, we begin exploring the power of two-way greedy\nfor set systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 09:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-24"}

In this letter we shall investigate the\ntheoretical implications of the constraint that the graviton is massless to an\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with linear coupling of the scalar field to the\nfour dimensional Gauss-Bonnet invariant. As we show, the constraint of having\ngravitational wave speed of the primordial gravitational waves equal to one,\nseverely restricts the dynamics of the scalar field, imposing a direct\nconstant-roll evolution on it.

Thus the phenomenology of the model\nis expected to be different, and we briefly discuss this issue too.

On the other hand, a\nsystem of second order differential equations defines a kinetic energy, which\nprovides a symmetric second order tensor called kinetic metric of the system.\nThis metric via its symmetries brings into the scene the numerous methods of\ndifferential geometry and hence it is apparent that one should manage to relate\nthe determination of the FIs to the symmetries of the kinetic metric. The\nsubject of this work is to provide a theorem that realizes this scenario. The\nmethod we follow considers the generic quadratic FI of the form\n$I=K_{ab}(t,q^{c})\\dot{q}^{a}\\dot{q}^{b}+K_{a}(t,q^{c})\\dot{q}^{a} +K(t,q^{c})$\nwhere $K_{ab}(t,q^{c}), K_{a}(t,q^{c}), K(t,q^{c})$ are unknown tensor\nquantities and requires $dI/dt = 0$. This condition leads to a system of\ndifferential equations involving the coefficients of $I$ whose solution\nprovides all possible quadratic FIs of this form. We demonstrate the\napplication of the theorem in the classical cases of the geodesic equations and\nthe generalized Kepler potential. We also obtain and discuss the time-dependent\nFIs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 11:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-24"}

We proved therefore\nthat the AR technique provides an important benefit to VLT science operations\nfor all the instruments sensitive to the PWV. Besides, we show how such an\nability in predicting the PWV can be useful also to predict the sky background\nin the infrared range (extremely appealing for METIS). We quantify such an\nability by applying this method to the NEAR project (New Earth in the Alpha Cen\nregion) supported by ESO and Breakthrough Initiatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 12:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

While much theoretical attention has been devoted to the spontaneous\nactivity of neurons, less is known about the dynamic mechanisms shaping their\nresponses to transient inputs, although these bear significant physiological\nrelevance. Here, we study responses to transient inputs in a widely used class\nof neuron models (nonlinear adaptive hybrid models) well-known to reproduce a\nnumber of biologically realistic behaviors. We focus on responses to transient\ninputs that have been previously associated with Type III neurons, arguably the\nleast studied category in Hodgkin's classification, which are those neurons\nthat never exhibit continuous firing in response to sustained excitatory\ncurrents. The two phenomena that we study are post-inhibitory facilitation, in\nwhich an otherwise subthreshold excitatory input can induce a spike if it is\napplied with proper timing after an inhibitory pulse, and slope detection, in\nwhich a neuron spikes to a transient input only when the input's rate of change\nis in a specific, bounded range. We analyze the origin of these phenomena in\nnonlinear hybrid models and provide a geometric characterization of dynamical\nstructures associated with PIF in the system and an analytical study of slope\ndetection for tent inputs. While the necessary and sufficient conditions for\nthese behaviors are easily satisfied in neurons with Type III excitability, our\nproofs are quite general and valid for neurons that do not exhibit Type III\nexcitability as well. This study therefore provides a framework for the\nmathematical analysis of these responses to transient inputs associated with\nType III neurons in other systems and for advancing our understanding of these\nsystems' computational properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 12:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-24"}

In this work, we propose a novel DNN structure for spatial\nprediction, where the spatial dependence is captured by adding an embedding\nlayer of spatial coordinates with basis functions. We show in theory and\nsimulation studies that the proposed DeepKriging method has a direct link to\nKriging in the Gaussian case, and it has multiple advantages over Kriging for\nnon-Gaussian and non-stationary data, i.e., it provides non-linear predictions\nand thus has smaller approximation errors, it does not require operations on\ncovariance matrices and thus is scalable for large datasets, and with\nsufficiently many hidden neurons, it provides the optimal prediction in terms\nof model capacity.

Here, we numerically explore the evolution\nof populations of planets in star clusters with an IMBH. We study the dynamical\nevolution of single-planet systems and free-floating planets, over a period of\n100~Myr, in star clusters without an IMBH, and in clusters with a central IMBH\nof mass $100~M_\\odot$ or $200~M_\\odot$. In the central region ($r\\lesssim\n0.2$~pc), the IMBH's tidal influence on planetary systems is typically 10~times\nstronger than the average neighbour star. For a star cluster with a\n$200M_\\odot$ IMBH, the region in which the IMBH's influence is stronger within\nthe virial radius ($\\sim 1$~pc). The IMBH quenches mass segregation, and the\nstars in the core tend to move towards intermediate regions. The ejection rate\nof both stars and planets is higher when an IMBH is present. The rate at which\nplanets are expelled from their host star rate is higher for clusters with\nhigher IMBH masses, for $t<0.5 t_{rh}$, while remains mostly constant while the\nstar cluster fills its Roche lobe, similar to a star cluster without an IMBH.\nThe disruption rate of planetary systems is higher in initially denser\nclusters, and for wider planetary orbits, but this rate is substantially\nenhanced by the presence of a central IMBH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 13:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Despite the recent success of neural\nsession-based recommenders, they are typically developed in an offline manner\nusing a static dataset. However, recommendation requires continual adaptation\nto take into account new and obsolete items and users, and requires \"continual\nlearning\" in real-life applications. In this case, the recommender is updated\ncontinually and periodically with new data that arrives in each update cycle,\nand the updated model needs to provide recommendations for user activities\nbefore the next model update. A major challenge for continual learning with\nneural models is catastrophic forgetting, in which a continually trained model\nforgets user preference patterns it has learned before. To deal with this\nchallenge, we propose a method called Adaptively Distilled Exemplar Replay\n(ADER) by periodically replaying previous training samples (i.e., exemplars) to\nthe current model with an adaptive distillation loss. Experiments are conducted\nbased on the state-of-the-art SASRec model using two widely used datasets to\nbenchmark ADER with several well-known continual learning techniques. We\nempirically demonstrate that ADER consistently outperforms other baselines, and\nit even outperforms the method using all historical data at every update cycle.\nThis result reveals that ADER is a promising solution to mitigate the\ncatastrophic forgetting issue towards building more realistic and scalable\nsession-based recommenders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 13:19:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-24"}

However, despite the importance of graph design, most of the\nliterature assumes that the graph is static. In this work, we present Grale, a\nscalable method we have developed to address the problem of graph design for\ngraphs with billions of nodes. Grale operates by fusing together different\nmeasures of(potentially weak) similarity to create a graph which exhibits high\ntask-specific homophily between its nodes.

We have deployed Grale in more than 20 different industrial\nsettings at Google, including datasets which have tens of billions of nodes,\nand hundreds of trillions of potential edges to score.

Here we further exploit this code\nin a detailed study of two important aspects connecting the simulations with\nthe VOS model. First, we study the sensitivity of the model calibration to the\npresence (or absence) of thermal oscillations due to high gradients in the\ninitial conditions.

We\nshow that a small amount of cooling has no statistically significant impact on\nthe VOS model calibration, while a longer dissipation period does have a\nnoticeable effect. Second, in doing this analysis we also introduce an improved\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo based pipeline for calibrating the VOS model,\nComparison to our previous bootstrap based pipeline shows that the latter\naccurately determined the best-fit values of the VOS model parameter, but\nunderestimated the uncertainties in some of the parameters.

In this work, we propose to solve such a few-shot (or low-shot)\nvisual reasoning problem, by resorting to analogical reasoning, which is a\nunique human ability to identify structural or relational similarity between\ntwo sets. Specifically, given training and test sets that contain the same type\nof visual reasoning problems, we extract the structural relationships between\nelements in both domains, and enforce them to be as similar as possible with\nanalogical learning. We repeatedly apply this process with slightly modified\nqueries of the same problem under the assumption that it does not affect the\nrelationship between a training and a test sample. This allows to learn the\nrelational similarity between the two samples in an effective manner even with\na single pair of samples. We validate our method on RAVEN dataset, on which it\noutperforms state-of-the-art method, with larger gains when the training data\nis scarce. We further meta-learn our analogical contrastive learning model over\nthe same tasks with diverse attributes, and show that it generalizes to the\nsame visual reasoning problem with unseen attributes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 14:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-24"}

On Earth and Super-Earth-sized bodies, where H2-rich primordial\nenvelopes are quickly lost to space, volcanic outgassing can act as a hydrogen\nsource, provided it balances with the loss rate from the top of the atmosphere.\nHere, we show that both Earth-like and Mars-like planets can sustain\natmospheric H2 fractions of several percent across relevant magmatic fO2\nranges. In general this requires hydrogen escape to operate somewhat less\nefficiently than the diffusion limit. We use a thermodynamical model of magma\ndegassing to determine which combinations of magma oxidation, volcanic flux,\nand hydrogen escape efficiency can build up appreciable levels of hydrogen in a\nplanet's secondary atmosphere. On a planet similar to the Archean Earth and\nwith a similar magmatic fO2, we suggest that the mixing ratio of atmospheric\nhydrogen could have been in the range 0.2-3%. A planet erupting magmas around\nthe Iron-Wustite (IW) buffer (i.e., ~3 log fO2 units lower than Archean\nEarth's), but with otherwise similar volcanic fluxes and H2 loss rates to early\nEarth, could sustain an atmosphere with approximately 10-20% H2. For an early\nMars-like planet with magmas around IW, but a lower range of surface pressures\nand volcanic fluxes compared to Earth, an atmospheric H2 mixing ratio of 2-8%\nis possible. On early Mars, this H2 mixing ratio could be sufficient to\ndeglaciate the planet. However, the sensitivity of these results to primary\nmagmatic water contents and volcanic fluxes show the need for improved\nconstraints on the crustal recycling efficiency and mantle water contents of\nearly Mars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 14:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-03"}

To better\nunderstand the kinetic properties of a collisionless radiative plasma subject\nto externally driven turbulence, we investigate particle-in-cell simulations of\nrelativistic plasma turbulence with external inverse Compton cooling acting on\nthe electrons. We find that ions continuously heat up while electrons gradually\ncool down (due to the net effect of radiation), and hence the ion-to-electron\ntemperature ratio $T_i/T_e$ grows in time. We show that $T_i/T_e$ is limited\nonly by the size and duration of the simulations (reaching $T_i/T_e \\sim\n10^3$), indicating that there are no efficient collisionless mechanisms of\nelectron-ion thermal coupling. This result has implications for models of\nradiatively inefficient accretion flows, such as observed in the Galactic\nCenter and in M87, for which so-called two-temperature plasmas with $T_i/T_e\n\\gg 1$ have been invoked to explain their low luminosity. Additionally, we find\nthat electrons acquire a quasi-thermal distribution (dictated by the\ncompetition of turbulent particle energization and radiative cooling), while\nions undergo efficient nonthermal acceleration (acquiring a harder distribution\nthan in equivalent non-radiative simulations). There is a modest nonthermal\npopulation of high-energy electrons that are beamed intermittently in space,\ntime, and direction; these beamed electrons may explain rapid flares in certain\nhigh-energy astrophysical systems (e.g., in the Galactic Center).

Nevertheless, every cosmological\ntest based on voids must necessarily employ methods to identify them in\nredshift space. Therefore, redshift-space distortions (RSD) and the\nAlcock-Paczynski effect (AP) have an impact on the void identification process\nitself generating distortion patterns in observations. Using a spherical void\nfinder, we developed a statistical and theoretical framework to describe\nphysically the connection between the identification in real and redshift\nspace. We found that redshift-space voids above the shot noise level have a\nunique real-space counterpart spanning the same region of space, they are\nsystematically bigger and their centres are preferentially shifted along the\nline of sight. The expansion effect is a by-product of RSD induced by tracer\ndynamics at scales around the void radius, whereas the off-centring effect\nconstitutes a different class of RSD induced at larger scales by the global\ndynamics of the whole region containing the void. The volume of voids is also\naltered by the fiducial cosmology assumed to measure distances, this is the AP\nchange of volume. These three systematics have an impact on cosmological\nstatistics.

For one-stage detectors\nwhich do not have RPN, it is more demanding to have powerful sub-networks\ncapable of directly capturing objects of unknown sizes. To enhance such\ncapability, we propose an extremely efficient neural architecture search\nmethod, named Fast And Diverse (FAD), to better explore the optimal\nconfiguration of receptive fields and convolution types in the sub-networks for\none-stage detectors. FAD consists of a designed search space and an efficient\narchitecture search algorithm. The search space contains a rich set of diverse\ntransformations designed specifically for object detection. To cope with the\ndesigned search space, a novel search algorithm termed Representation Sharing\n(RepShare) is proposed to effectively identify the best combinations of the\ndefined transformations. In our experiments, FAD obtains prominent improvements\non two types of one-stage detectors with various backbones. In particular, our\nFAD detector achieves 46.4 AP on MS-COCO (under single-scale testing),\noutperforming the state-of-the-art detectors, including the most recent\nNAS-based detectors, Auto-FPN (searched for 16 GPU-days) and NAS-FCOS (28\nGPU-days), while significantly reduces the search cost to 0.6 GPU-days.

However, we find in experiments that the automatic crack\ndetectors based on deep learning are obviously underestimated by the widely\nused mean Average Precision (mAP) standard. This paper presents a study on the\nevaluation standard. It is clarified that the random fractal of crack disables\nthe mAP standard, because the strict box matching in mAP calculation is\nunreasonable for the fractal feature. As a solution, a fractal-available\nevaluation standard named CovEval is proposed to correct the underestimation in\ncrack detection. In CovEval, a different matching process based on the idea of\ncovering box matching is adopted for this issue. In detail, Cover Area rate\n(CAr) is designed as a covering overlap, and a multi-match strategy is employed\nto release the one-to-one matching restriction in mAP. Extended Recall (XR),\nExtended Precision (XP) and Extended F-score (Fext) are defined for scoring the\ncrack detectors. In experiments using several common frameworks for object\ndetection, models get much higher scores in crack detection according to\nCovEval, which matches better with the visual performance. Moreover, based on\nfaster R-CNN framework, we present a case study to optimize a crack detector\nbased on CovEval standard. Recall (XR) of our best model achieves an\nindustrial-level at 95.8, which implies that with reasonable standard for\nevaluation, the methods for object detection are with great potential for\nautomatic industrial inspection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 15:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-24"}

Load test generation is a crucial activity in performance\ntesting. Existing approaches for load test generation require expertise in\nperformance modeling, or they are dependent on the system model or the source\ncode.\n  Aim: This thesis aims to propose and evaluate a model-free learning-based\napproach for load test generation, which doesn't require access to the system\nmodels or source code.\n  Method: In this thesis, we treated the problem of optimal load test\ngeneration as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem.

The case of a\ntwo-dimensional domain poses both statistical and computational challenges,\nwhich are typically alleviated by assuming separability. However, separability\nis often questionable, sometimes even demonstrably inadequate. We propose a\nframework for the analysis of covariance operators of random surfaces that\ngeneralises separability, while retaining its major advantages. Our approach is\nbased on the expansion of the covariance into a series of separable terms. The\nexpansion is valid for any covariance over a two-dimensional domain. Leveraging\nthe key notion of the partial inner product, we extend the power iteration\nmethod to general Hilbert spaces and show how the aforementioned expansion can\nbe efficiently constructed in practice. Truncation of the expansion and\nretention of the leading terms automatically induces a non-parametric estimator\nof the covariance, whose parsimony is dictated by the truncation level. The\nresulting estimator can be calculated, stored and manipulated with little\ncomputational overhead relative to separability. Consistency and rates of\nconvergence are derived under mild regularity assumptions, illustrating the\ntrade-off between bias and variance regulated by the truncation level.

In this work, we\ncome up with the idea that instead of static plugins that the currently\navailable loss functions are, they should by default be flexible in nature. A\nflexible loss function can be a more insightful navigator for neural networks\nleading to higher convergence rates and therefore reaching the optimum accuracy\nmore quickly. The insights to help decide the degree of flexibility can be\nderived from the complexity of ANNs, the data distribution, selection of\nhyper-parameters and so on. In the wake of this, we introduce a novel flexible\nloss function for neural networks. The function is shown to characterize a\nrange of fundamentally unique properties from which, much of the properties of\nother loss functions are only a subset and varying the flexibility parameter in\nthe function allows it to emulate the loss curves and the learning behavior of\nprevalent static loss functions. The extensive experimentation performed with\nthe loss function demonstrates that it is able to give state-of-the-art\nperformance on selected data sets. Thus, in all the idea of flexibility itself\nand the proposed function built upon it carry the potential to open to a new\ninteresting chapter in deep learning research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 02:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-27"}

Then, we perform the DEP\nprocess and use the obtained frequencies (of spherical and ellipsoid models)\nfor the alignment of the SWCNTs. Our empirical results declare the theoretical\nprediction, i.e., a crucial step toward the realization of carbon nanotube\nfield-effect transistor (CNT-FET) with the DEP process based on the ellipsoid\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 19:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

Vernier schemes, which use paired transmitter and receiver phased\narrays with different periodicity, deliberately misalign the transmission and\nreceive patterns so that only a single pairing of transmit/receive lobes permit\na signal to be detected. A pair of OPAs designed to exploit this effect thereby\neffectively suppress the effects of grating lobes and recover the system's\nfield-of-view, avoid potential ambiguities, and reduce excess noise. Here we\nanalytically evaluate Vernier schemes with arbitrary phase control to find\noptimal configurations, as well as elucidate the manner in which a Vernier\nscheme can recover the full field-of-view. We present the first experimental\nimplementation of a Vernier scheme and demonstrate grating lobe suppression\nusing a pair of 2D wavelength-steered OPAs. These results present a route\nforward for addressing the pervasive issue of grating lobes, significantly\nalleviating the need for dense emitter pitches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 19:54:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

The time-lagged\nanalysis shows that behavioral patterns seen in shopping actions are highly\nresponsive to epidemic development. Based on these findings, we present a\nconsumer demand prediction method by encompassing the epidemic statistics and\nbehavioral features for COVID-19 related products.
