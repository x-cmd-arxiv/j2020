We start by employing a well motivated\n$f(Q,T)$ gravity model, $f(Q,T)=mQ^{n}+bT$ where $m,n$ and $b$ are model\nparameters. Additionally we also assume the universe to be dominated by\npressure-less matter which yields a power law type scale factor of the form $%\na(t)=c_{2}(At+c_{1})^{\\frac{1}{A}}$, where $A=\\dfrac{3(8\\pi +b)}{n(16\\pi +3b)%\n}$ and $c_{1}$ \\& $c_{2}$ are just integration constants. To investigate the\ncosmological viability of the model, constraints on the model parameters were\nimposed from the updated 57 points of Hubble data sets and 580 points of union\n2.1 compilation supernovae data sets. We have thoroughly investigated the\nnature of geometrical dark energy mimicked by the parametrization of\n$f(Q,T)=mQ^{n}+bT$ with the assistance of statefinder diagnostic in $\\{s,r\\}$\nand $\\{q,r\\}$ planes and also performed the $Om$ -diagnostic analysis. The\npresent analysis makes it clear-cut that $f(Q,T)$ gravity can be promising in\naddressing the current cosmic acceleration and therefore a suitable alternative\nto the dark energy problem. Further studies in other cosmological areas are\ntherefore encouraging to further investigate the viability of $f(Q,T)$ gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 17:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-06"}

The RNN backbone then captures the temporal\npattern of the prototypes, which we refer to as prototype trajectories.\nPrototype trajectories enable intuitive and fine-grained interpretation of the\nreasoning process of the RNN model, in resemblance to how humans analyze texts.\nWe also design a prototype pruning procedure to reduce the total number of\nprototypes used by the model for better interpretability. Experiments on\nmultiple public data sets show that ProtoryNet is more accurate than the\nbaseline prototype-based deep neural net and reduces the performance gap\ncompared to state-of-the-art black-box models. In addition, after prototype\npruning, the resulting ProtoryNet models only need less than or around 20\nprototypes for all datasets, which significantly benefits interpretability.\nFurthermore, we report a survey result indicating that human users find\nProtoryNet more intuitive and easier to understand than other prototype-based\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 16:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 13:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

All these applications share the problem of\nidentifying a representative subset of alternatives -- and the study of\nmulti-winner voting is the principled analysis of this task.\n  This book provides a thorough and in-depth look at multi-winner voting based\non approval preferences. One speaks of approval preferences if voters express\ntheir preferences by providing a set of candidates they approve. Approval\npreferences thus separate candidates in approved and disapproved ones, a\nsimple, binary classification. The corresponding multi-winner voting rules are\ncalled approval-based committee (ABC) rules. Due to the simplicity of approval\npreferences, ABC rules are widely suitable for practical use.\n  Recent years have seen a rising interest in ABC voting.

This discipline is situated in the intersection of\nartificial intelligence, computer science, economics, and (to a lesser degree)\npolitical science, combining insights and methods from these distinct fields.\nThe goal of this book is to present fundamental concepts and results for ABC\nvoting and to discuss the recent advances in computational social choice.

Shear bands have broad implications for materials\nprocessing and failure under dynamic loading in a wide variety of material\nsystems ranging from metals to rocks. This year marks 75 years since the\npublication of Zener and Hollomon's pioneering work on shear bands which is\nwidely credited with drawing the attention of the mechanics community to shear\nbands and related localization phenomena. There has since been significant\nexperimental and theoretical investigation into the onset of shear banding.\nYet, given the extremely small length and time scales associated with band\ndevelopment, several challenges persist in studying the evolution of single\nbands. Recent full-field displacement measurements, coupled with numerical\nmodeling, have only begun to ameliorate this problem. This article summarizes\nour present understanding of plastic flow dynamics around single shear bands\nand the subsequent transition to fracture, with special applications to\nmaterials processing. We begin with a semi-historical look at some of Zener's\nearly ideas on shear bands and discuss recent advances in experimental methods\nfor mapping localized flow during band formation, including direct \\emph{in\nsitu} imaging as well as \\emph{ex situ}/post-mortem analyses. Classical\ntheories are revisited in the light of recently published experimental data.\nShear bands exhibit a wealth of complex flow characteristics that bear striking\nresemblance to boundary layer phenomena in fluid flows.

Therefore, the accurate modeling of the corresponding MC channel is of\nhigh importance. The propagation of particles in these systems is caused by a\ncombination of diffusion and flow with a parabolic velocity profile, i.e.,\nlaminar flow. The propagation characteristics of the particles can be\ncategorized into three different regimes: The flow dominant regime where the\ninfluence of diffusion on the particle transport is negligible, the dispersive\nregime where diffusion has a much stronger impact than flow, and the mixed\nregime where both effects are important. For the limiting regimes, i.e., the\nflow dominant and dispersive regimes, there are well-known solutions and\napproximations for particle transport. In contrast, there is no general\nanalytical solution for the mixed regime, and instead, approximations,\nnumerical techniques, and particle based simulations have been employed. In\nthis paper, we develop a general model for the advection-diffusion problem in\ncylindrical environments which provides an analytical solution applicable in\nall regimes. The modeling procedure is based on a transfer function approach\nand the main focus lies on the incorporation of laminar flow into the\nanalytical model. The properties of the proposed model are analyzed by\nnumerical evaluation for different scenarios including the uniform and point\nrelease of particles. We provide a comparison with particle based simulations\nand the well-known solutions for the limiting regimes to demonstrate the\nvalidity of the proposed analytical model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 16:40:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-06"}

We test\nthe performance of such clustering redshift measurements using mock catalogues\nthat resemble the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). These mocks are created from the\nMICE simulation and closely mimic the properties of the KiDS source sample and\nthe overlapping spectroscopic reference samples. We quantify the performance of\nthe clustering redshifts by comparing the cross-correlation results with the\ntrue redshift distributions in each of the five KiDS photometric redshift bins.\nSuch a comparison to an informative model is necessary due to the\nincompleteness of the reference samples at high redshifts. Clustering mean\nredshifts are unbiased at $|\\Delta z|<0.006$ under these conditions. The\nredshift evolution of the galaxy bias can be reliably mitigated at this level\nof precision using auto-correlation measurements and self-consistency\nrelations, and will not become a dominant source of systematic error until the\narrival of Stage-IV cosmic shear surveys. Using redshift distributions from a\ndirect colour-based estimate instead of the true redshift distributions as a\nmodel for comparison with the clustering redshifts increases the biases in the\nmean to up to $|\\Delta z|\\sim0.04$.

When using the VAE as an anomaly detector, we present different\napproaches to detect anomalies: directly comparing in the input space or,\ninstead, working in the latent space. In order to facilitate general search\napproaches such as bump-hunt, mass-decorrelated VAEs based on distance\ncorrelation regularization are also studied.

In robotics, we have seen\ntremendous progress in using visual and tactile perception; however, we have\noften ignored a key sense: sound. This is primarily due to the lack of data\nthat captures the interplay of action and sound. In this work, we perform the\nfirst large-scale study of the interactions between sound and robotic action.\nTo do this, we create the largest available sound-action-vision dataset with\n15,000 interactions on 60 objects using our robotic platform Tilt-Bot. By\ntilting objects and allowing them to crash into the walls of a robotic tray, we\ncollect rich four-channel audio information. Using this data, we explore the\nsynergies between sound and action and present three key insights. First, sound\nis indicative of fine-grained object class information, e.g., sound can\ndifferentiate a metal screwdriver from a metal wrench. Second, sound also\ncontains information about the causal effects of an action, i.e. given the\nsound produced, we can predict what action was applied to the object. Finally,\nobject representations derived from audio embeddings are indicative of implicit\nphysical properties. We demonstrate that on previously unseen objects, audio\nembeddings generated through interactions can predict forward models 24% better\nthan passive visual embeddings.

The near-IR radial profiles are well\ndescribed by an NFW model with a high (c~7) concentration parameter. Dust\nemission is similarly concentrated, albeit suppressed at small radii\n(r<0.2Mpc). The measured SEDs lack warm dust, consistent with the colder SEDs\nexpected for low mass galaxies. We derive total stellar masses consistent with\nthe theoretical Mhalo-M_star relation and specific-star formation rates that\nevolve strongly with redshift, echoing that of massive (log Mstar/Msun>10)\ncluster galaxies. Separating out the massive galaxy population reveals that the\nmajority of cluster far-IR emission (~70-80%) is provided by the low mass\nconstituents, which differs from field galaxies.

A lockdown for a period of 2 months, due to the pandemic, was\nenough to cause a drop of 7% of the anthropogonic CO2 in the atmosphere. In\naddition to the world in general, the excess of the anthropogonic CO2 emission\nin the atmosphere has always been a threat to the oceans as well. Oceans play a\nkey role to buffer the greenhouse effect, but in the process, it becomes\nwarmer, more acidic, and less oxygenated. While there have already been\ninvestigations done on the effect of pandemic on atmosphere, the question what\nhappens to oceans during the pandemic remains unanswered. The aim of this paper\nis to study the pandemic's effect and the resultant reduction in CO2 emissions\non the productivity of the global oceans. Often Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a),\nParticulate organic and inorganic carbon (PIC:POC) and sea surface\ntemperature(SST), are used to indicate the productivity of oceans. Herein,\nsatellite-derived estimates of the aforementioned parameters are used. Based on\nthese estimates, a drop in Chl-a (0.5 mgm-3) is observed off Alaska, North\nEurope,South China and Southeast USA during the pandemic. CO2 reduction of 123\nMtCO2 during the pandemic in China might have caused reduction in mean Chl-a by\naround 5% (2.5 to 1.6 mgm-3). Reduction of Chl-a during the pandemic is mostly\nassociated with the reduction of PIC:POC. The pandemic demonstrates noticeable\neffect on Chl-a and/or SST. A cooling response of 0.5 oC in mean SST is\nobserved over most of the coastal areas, especially off Alaska,north Indian\nocean and eastern Pacific. The decrease in the CO2 emissions in India by 30%\nduring the pandemic translates into a drop of mean SST in the north Indian\nocean by 5% (from 29.95 to 28.46 oC). All these suggest that maintaining global\nactivities as sustainable as the pandemic period, can help to recover the\noceans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 18:22:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

The\nchosen uncertain parameters are modeled as random Gaussian-distributed\nvariables, making stochastic the system of governing equations. The proposed\nmethodology is initially validated on a model equation, presenting a thorough\nconvergence study which confirms the spectral accuracy of the stochastic\ncollocation method and the second-order accuracy of the IMEX finite volume\nscheme chosen to solve the mathematical model. Then, univariate and\nmultivariate uncertain quantification analyses are applied to the a-FSI blood\nflow model, concerning baseline and patient-specific single-artery test cases.\nA different sensitivity is depicted when comparing the variability of flow rate\nand velocity waveforms to the variability of pressure and area, the latter ones\nresulting much more sensitive to the parametric uncertainties underlying the\nmechanical characterization of vessel walls. Simulations performed considering\nboth the simple elastic and the more realistic viscoelastic constitutive law\nshow that the great uncertainty of the viscosity parameter plays a major role\nin the prediction of pressure waveforms, enlarging the confidence interval of\nthis variable. In-vivo recorded patient-specific pressure data falls within the\nconfidence interval of the output obtained with the proposed methodology and\nexpectations of the computed pressures are comparable to the recorded\nwaveforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 18:46:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 10:17:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

We aim at\nexploring the streaming flow of galaxies onto groups using observational\npeculiar velocity data. The effects of distance uncertainties are also analyzed\nas well as the relation between the infall pattern and group and environment\nproperties.This work deals with analysis of peculiar velocity data and their\nprojection on the direction to group centers, to determine the mean galaxy\ninfall flow.

Well\nbeyond the group virial radius, the surrounding large-scale galaxy overdensity\nmay impose additional infalling streaming amplitudes in the range 200 to 400 km\ns$^{-1}$.

Current popular solutions leverage object\nlocalization maps from classifiers as supervision signals, and struggle to make\nthe localization maps capture more complete object content. Rather than\nprevious efforts that primarily focus on intra-image information, we address\nthe value of cross-image semantic relations for comprehensive object pattern\nmining. To achieve this, two neural co-attentions are incorporated into the\nclassifier to complimentarily capture cross-image semantic similarities and\ndifferences. In particular, given a pair of training images, one co-attention\nenforces the classifier to recognize the common semantics from co-attentive\nobjects, while the other one, called contrastive co-attention, drives the\nclassifier to identify the unshared semantics from the rest, uncommon objects.\nThis helps the classifier discover more object patterns and better ground\nsemantics in image regions. In addition to boosting object pattern learning,\nthe co-attention can leverage context from other related images to improve\nlocalization map inference, hence eventually benefiting semantic segmentation\nlearning. More essentially, our algorithm provides a unified framework that\nhandles well different WSSS settings, i.e., learning WSSS with (1) precise\nimage-level supervision only, (2) extra simple single-label data, and (3) extra\nnoisy web data.

A typical approach in this case\nimplies using machine translation of English corpora to a target language. In\nthis work, we study the caveats of applying directly translated corpora for\nfine-tuning LMs for downstream natural language processing tasks and\ndemonstrate that careful curation along with post-processing lead to improved\nperformance and overall LMs robustness. In the empirical evaluation, we perform\na comparison of directly translated against curated Spanish SQuAD datasets on\nboth user and system levels. Further experimental results on XQuAD and MLQA\ntransfer-learning evaluation question answering tasks show that presumably\nmultilingual LMs exhibit more resilience to machine translation artifacts in\nterms of the exact match score.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 22:22:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

The proposed\nnovel interpretation of RMs in the multi-agent setting explicitly encodes\nrequired teammate interdependencies, allowing the team-level task to be\ndecomposed into sub-tasks for individual agents.

Yet other models, particularly rule-based, are more\nreadable and explainable and can even be competitive when labelled data is not\nabundant. However, most of the existing rule-based classifiers suffer from the\nproduction of a large number of classification rules, affecting the model\nreadability. This hampers the classification accuracy as noisy rules might not\nadd any useful informationfor classification and also lead to longer\nclassification time. In this study, we propose SigD2 which uses a novel,\ntwo-stage pruning strategy which prunes most of the noisy, redundant and\nuninteresting rules and makes the classification model more accurate and\nreadable. To make SigDirect more competitive with the most prevalent but\nuninterpretable machine learning-based classifiers like neural networks and\nsupport vector machines, we propose bagging and boosting on the ensemble of the\nSigDirect classifier. The results of the proposed algorithms are quite\npromising and we are able to obtain a minimal set of statistically significant\nrules for classification without jeopardizing the classification accuracy. We\nuse 15 UCI datasets and compare our approach with eight existing systems.The\nSigD2 and boosted SigDirect (ACboost) ensemble model outperform various\nstate-of-the-art classifiers not only in terms of classification accuracy but\nalso in terms of the number of rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 00:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

We present a pilot study aimed at evaluating the implications of using\nthese pure acoustic mode frequencies in seismic studies of the helium\nstructural variation in red giants. The study is based on artificial seismic\ndata for a red-giant-branch stellar model, bracketing seven acoustic dipole\nradial orders around vmax. The pure acoustic dipole-mode frequencies are\nderived from a fit to the mixed-mode period spacings and then used to compute\nthe pure acoustic dipole-mode second differences. The pure acoustic dipole-mode\nsecond differences inferred through this procedure follow the same oscillatory\nfunction as the radial modes second differences. The additional constraints\nbrought by the dipolar modes allow us to adopt a more complete description of\nthe glitch signature when performing the fit to the second differences. The\namplitude of the glitch retrieved from this fit is 15% smaller than that from\nthe fit based on the radial modes alone. Also, we find that thanks to the\nadditional constraints, a bias in the inferred glitch location, found when\nadopting the simpler description of the glitch, is avoided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 00:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

The analysis is performed between January 1, 2018\nand June 23, 2020 (100 days of quarantine). The daily death rate per million\ninhabitants has been used. The days in which the departments were quarantined\nwith a limit number of accumulated cases of COVID-19 were used to estimate the\nquarantine impact. Three limits were established for cases: less than 1, 10 and\n100 cases. Result: In Peru, the daily death rate per million inhabitants\ndecreased by -1.89 (95% CI: -2.70; -1.07) on quarantine days and without\nCOVID-19 cases. When comparing this result with the total number of non-violent\ndeaths, the excess deaths during the first 100 days of quarantine is 36,230.\nThis estimate is 1.12 times the estimate with data from 2019 and 4.2 times the\ndeaths officers by COVID-19.

We trace some of the\nlarger discrepancies to choices involving pseudopotentials, the DFT+U\nformalism, and elemental reference states, and argue that further\nstandardization of HT-DFT would be beneficial to reproducibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 02:26:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2022 21:34:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

We focus on fixed-point methods that converge asymptotically\nlinearly with convergence factor $\\rho<1$ and that solve an underlying fully\nsmooth and non-convex optimization problem. It is often observed that AA and\nNGMRES substantially improve the asymptotic convergence behavior of the\nfixed-point iteration, but this improvement has not been quantified\ntheoretically. We investigate this problem under simplified conditions. First,\nwe consider stationary versions of AA and NGMRES, and determine coefficients\nthat result in optimal asymptotic convergence factors, given knowledge of the\nspectrum of $q'(x)$ at the fixed point $x^*$. This allows us to understand and\nquantify the asymptotic convergence improvement that can be provided by\nnonlinear convergence acceleration, viewing $x_{k+1}=q(x_k)$ as a nonlinear\npreconditioner for AA and NGMRES. Second, for the case of infinite window size,\nwe consider linear asymptotic convergence bounds for GMRES applied to the\nfixed-point iteration linearized about $x^*$. Since AA and NGMRES are\nequivalent to GMRES in the linear case, one may expect the GMRES convergence\nfactors to be relevant for AA and NGMRES as $x_k \\rightarrow x^*$. Our results\nare illustrated numerically for a class of test problems from canonical tensor\ndecomposition, comparing steepest descent and alternating least squares (ALS)\nas the fixed-point iterations that are accelerated by AA and NGMRES.

Human\nperception could be helpful to capture these disparate phenomena and\ninterpreting their impact; the challenge is collecting spatially and temporally\ndiverse subjective feedback in a scalable way. This paper presents a\nmethodology to collect intensive longitudinal subjective feedback of\ncomfort-based preference using micro ecological momentary assessments on a\nsmartwatch platform. An experiment with 30 occupants over two weeks produced\n4,378 field-based surveys for thermal, noise, and acoustic preference. The\noccupants and the spaces in which they left feedback were then clustered\naccording to these preference tendencies. These groups were used to create\ndifferent feature sets with combinations of environmental and physiological\nvariables, for use in a multi-class classification task. These classification\nmodels were trained on a feature set that was developed from time-series\nattributes, environmental and near-body sensors, heart rate, and the historical\npreferences of both the individual and the comfort group assigned. The most\naccurate model had multi-class classification F1 micro scores of 64%, 80% and\n86% for thermal, light, and noise preference, respectively. The discussion\noutlines how these models can enhance comfort preference prediction when\nsupplementing data from installed sensors. The approach presented prompts\nreflection on how the building analysis community evaluates, controls, and\ndesigns indoor environments through balancing the measurement of variables with\nstrategically asking for occupant preferences in an intensive longitudinal way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 05:52:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 06:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-30"}

As the measurement noise in low-light\nimages is usually significant yet complex with spatially-varying\ncharacteristic, how to handle the noise effectively is an important yet\nchallenging problem in low-light image enhancement. Based on the Retinex\ndecomposition of natural images, this paper proposes a deep learning method for\nlow-light image enhancement with a particular focus on handling the measurement\nnoise.

In 5G\nnetworks, the NG-RAN architecture splits the Base Band Unit (BBU) into Central\nand Distributed Units (CU and DU). This structure has created a mid-haul\nNetwork, connecting CUs and DUs. The recent advancements in dataplane\nprogrammability can be used to enhance system performance. We show how P4\nswitches can be used to parse the packets between DU, CU, and Back Haul (Core\nNetwork) for potential system improvements. In particular, we consider the\nscenario of mobile handover. The proposed protocol is called SMARTHO,\nillustrating a smart handover.\n  Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors (P4) is a programming\nlanguage designed to support specification and programming the forwarding plane\nbehavior of network switches/routers. In SMARTHO, we use P4 Switches to\nintervene in the handover process for fixed-path mobile users. A resource\npre-allocation scheme that reserves resources before the UE reaches a future\ncell, is proposed. The solution is implemented using a P4-based switch\nintroduced between the CU and the DU. The P4 switch is used to spoof the\nbehavior of User Equipment (UE) and perform the resource allocation in advance.\n  The proposed SMARTHO framework is implemented in the mininet emulation\nenvironment and in a reconfigurable hardware environment using NetFPGA-SUME\nboards. The emulation results show a handover response time improvement of 18%\nfor a tandem of two HOs and 25% for a tandem of three HOs. For testbed\nimplementation, we used NetFPGA-SUME boards as P4 switches. The handover time\nwas measured to be approximately 50~milliseconds in the experiments conducted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 06:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

Micromagnetic\nsimulations have been used to explore the interaction of gyrotropic vortex core\ndynamics with the curling modes observed in the region of circulating in-plane\nmagnetization. Hybridization of the fundamental gyrotropic mode with the\ndegenerate, lowest-frequency, azimuthal modes has previously been reported to\nlead to their splitting and counter propagating motion, as we observe in our\nspectra and measured images.

While it is challenging to identify if such modes are truly\nhybridized from the mode dispersion in a confined disc, our simulations reveal\nthat spiral spin waves from the core may act as mediators of the interaction\nbetween the core dynamics and azimuthal modes. At higher frequency, modes with\nradial character only do not exhibit marked curling, but instead show evidence\nof interaction with spin waves generated at the edge of the disc.

For MBHs evolving in gas-rich backgrounds, the\nionizing radiation that emerges from the innermost parts of their accretion\nflow can affect the surrounding gas in such a way to cause the MBHs to\naccelerate and gain orbital energy.

We\nuse a semi-analytic model to study the impact of negative DF on pairs of MBHs\nin merger remnant galaxies evolving under the combined influence of stellar and\ngaseous DF.

While working with data from two different datasets, which are sampled\nat different frequencies, often, data from both the datasets may need to\nresample at a common target frequency, which may be the frequency of either of\nthe datasets or could be a different one.

However, current deep learning approaches to despeckling\nrequire supervision for training, whereas clean SAR images are impossible to\nobtain.

Conventional\npoint-based models exploit local patterns through a symmetric function (e.g.\nmax pooling) or based on graphs, which easily leads to loss of fine-grained\ngeometric structures. Regarding capturing spatial patterns, CNNs are powerful\nbut it would be computationally costly to directly apply convolutions on point\ndata after voxelizing the entire point clouds to a dense regular 3D grid. In\nthis work, we aim to improve performance of point-based models by enhancing\ntheir pattern learning ability through leveraging CNNs while preserving\ncomputational efficiency. We propose a novel and principled Local Grid\nRendering (LGR) operation to render the small neighborhood of a subset of input\npoints into a low-resolution 3D grid independently, which allows small-size\nCNNs to accurately model local patterns and avoids convolutions over a dense\ngrid to save computation cost.

We present the near field scanning microscopy (NSOM) results of\nSurface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs), excited by linearly polarized illumination\non a gold, nanofabricated transmission grating. The optimization process is\nperformed for infrared light, for future applications in cold atoms trapping\nand plasmonic sensing. We show the in situ processes of build up and\npropagation of SPPs and confirm that the out of plane component is not coupled\nto the aperture-type NSOM probe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 14:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

For the Poisson regression model,\nseveral prediction regions are developed and their performance are compared\nthrough simulation studies. The methods are applied to the problem of\nforecasting daily and cumulative deaths in the United States (US) due to\nCOVID-19. To examine their performance relative to what actually happened,\ndaily deaths data until May 15th were used to forecast cumulative deaths by\nJune 1st. It was observed that there is over-dispersion in the observed data\nrelative to the Poisson regression model. An over-dispersed Poisson regression\nmodel is therefore proposed. This new model builds on frailty ideas in Survival\nAnalysis and over-dispersion is quantified through an additional parameter. The\nPoisson regression model is a hidden model in this over-dispersed Poisson\nregression model and obtains as a limiting case when the over-dispersion\nparameter increases to infinity. A prediction region for the cumulative number\nof US deaths due to COVID-19 by July 16th, given the data until July 2nd, is\npresented. Finally, the paper discusses limitations of proposed procedures and\nmentions open research problems, as well as the dangers and pitfalls when\nforecasting on a long horizon, with focus on this pandemic where events, both\nforeseen and unforeseen, could have huge impacts on point predictions and\nprediction regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 14:20:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 01:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

Tsetlin Machines (TMs) are a recent approach to\nmachine learning that has demonstrated significantly reduced energy usage\ncompared to neural networks alike, while performing competitively accuracy-wise\non several benchmarks. However, TMs rely heavily on energy-costly random number\ngeneration to stochastically guide a team of Tsetlin Automata to a Nash\nEquilibrium of the TM game. In this paper, we propose a novel finite-state\nlearning automaton that can replace the Tsetlin Automata in TM learning, for\nincreased determinism. The new automaton uses multi-step deterministic state\njumps to reinforce sub-patterns. Simultaneously, flipping a coin to skip every\n$d$'th state update ensures diversification by randomization. The $d$-parameter\nthus allows the degree of randomization to be finely controlled. E.g., $d=1$\nmakes every update random and $d=\\infty$ makes the automaton completely\ndeterministic. Our empirical results show that, overall, only substantial\ndegrees of determinism reduces accuracy. Energy-wise, random number generation\nconstitutes switching energy consumption of the TM, saving up to 11 mW power\nfor larger datasets with high $d$ values. We can thus use the new $d$-parameter\nto trade off accuracy against energy consumption, to facilitate low-energy\nmachine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 14:56:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

This task\nrequires fitting an in-shop cloth image on the image of a person, which is\nhighly challenging because it involves cloth warping, image compositing, and\nsynthesizing. Casting virtual try-on into a supervised task faces a difficulty:\navailable datasets are composed of pairs of pictures (cloth, person wearing the\ncloth). Thus, we have no access to ground-truth when the cloth on the person\nchanges. State-of-the-art models solve this by masking the cloth information on\nthe person with both a human parser and a pose estimator. Then, image synthesis\nmodules are trained to reconstruct the person image from the masked person\nimage and the cloth image. This procedure has several caveats: firstly, human\nparsers are prone to errors; secondly, it is a costly pre-processing step,\nwhich also has to be applied at inference time; finally, it makes the task\nharder than it is since the mask covers information that should be kept such as\nhands or accessories. In this paper, we propose a novel student-teacher\nparadigm where the teacher is trained in the standard way (reconstruction)\nbefore guiding the student to focus on the initial task (changing the cloth).\nThe student additionally learns from an adversarial loss, which pushes it to\nfollow the distribution of the real images.
