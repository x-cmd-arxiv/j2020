A natural solution is to borrow the idea from\nmulti-exposure, which captures multiple shots to obtain well-exposed images\nunder challenging conditions. High-quality implementation/approximation of\nmulti-exposure from a single image is however nontrivial. Fortunately, as shown\nin this paper, neither is such high-quality necessary since our task is face\ndetection rather than image enhancement. Specifically, we propose a novel\nRecurrent Exposure Generation (REG) module and couple it seamlessly with a\nMulti-Exposure Detection (MED) module, and thus significantly improve face\ndetection performance by effectively inhibiting non-uniform illumination and\nnoise issues. REG produces progressively and efficiently intermediate images\ncorresponding to various exposure settings, and such pseudo-exposures are then\nfused by MED to detect faces across different lighting conditions. The proposed\nmethod, named REGDet, is the first `detection-with-enhancement' framework for\nlow-light face detection. It not only encourages rich interaction and feature\nfusion across different illumination levels, but also enables effective\nend-to-end learning of the REG component to be better tailored for face\ndetection. Moreover, as clearly shown in our experiments, REG can be flexibly\ncoupled with different face detectors without extra low/normal-light image\npairs for training. We tested REGDet on the DARK FACE low-light face benchmark\nwith thorough ablation study, where REGDet outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-arts by a significant margin, with only negligible extra\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 17:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

Given the\nconsiderable literature regarding the resilience of infrastructure networks\nusing graph theory, it is not surprising that a number of applications of GSP\ncan be found in the resilience domain. GSP techniques assume that the choice of\ngraphical Fourier transform (GFT) imparts a particular spectral structure on\nthe signal of interest. We assess a number of power distribution systems with\nrespect to metrics of signal structure and identify several correlates to\nsystem properties and further demonstrate how these metrics relate to\nperformance of some GSP techniques. We also discuss the feasibility of a\ndata-driven approach that improves these metrics and apply it to a water\ndistribution scenario. Overall, we find that many of the candidate systems\nanalyzed are properly structured in the chosen GFT basis and amenable to GSP\ntechniques, but identify considerable variability and nuance that merits future\ninvestigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 17:31:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

For different electrolytes, the ability\nto inhibit bubble coalescence correlates to the ion specificity at the air\nwater interface at an abnormal cation-anion pair relationship, rather than the\ntypically expected cation or anion series that was widely reported in\natmospheric, bio- and chemical processes. Here we show that the inhomogeneous\ninterfacial flow, at a different electrolyte concentration from the solution\nbecause of the surface specificity of both cation and anion, contributes to the\nbubble coalescence inhibition behavior in electrolyte solutions. The\ninterfacial flow, achieved with the mobile air-water interface, contributes to\nthe continuous change of electrolyte concentration within the liquid film\nformed between two colliding bubbles, thereby resulting in a concentration\ngradient of electrolytes between the thin film and the bulk solution. The\nelectrolyte concentration gradient, hence surface tension gradient, becomes\nsignificant to resist film thinning when the film thickness reaches tens of\nnanometers. The retarded film thinning between two bubbles and delayed bubble\ncoalescence were experimentally captured by high-speed interferometry and\nquantitatively explained by the proposed electrolyte transportation model. This\nfinding clearly highlights the coupled effect of interfacial flow and ion\nspecificity, and shows important implications for improved understanding of\nocean waves, for future development of colloidal science in high concentration\nelectrolyte solutions that is critical for biology, and benefits many applied\nfields like water splitting and mineral extraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 17:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

The recently proposed\nsplashback radius tends to be larger and to include more subhalos than even the\nlargest spherical overdensity boundaries. We systematically investigate the\ndependence of the subhalo fraction on the radius definition and show that it\ncan vary by factors of unity between different spherical overdensity\ndefinitions. Using splashback radii can yet double the abundance of subhalos\ncompared to the virial definition.

ORG improves visual\nrepresentation learning by integrating object relationships, including category\ncloseness and spatial correlations, e.g., a TV usually co-occurs with a remote\nspatially.

For blue phosphorene, the most stable\nstacking configuration has not yet been reported, and surprisingly it is\nmetallic, while all other arrangements are indirect band gap semiconductors. As\nit is impossible to interchange the stacking configurations by translations,\nall of them should be experimentally accessible via the transfer of monolayers.\nThe metallic character of blue phosphorene bilayer is caused by its short\ninterlayer distance of 3.01 {\\AA} and offers the exceptional possibility to\ndesign single elemental all-phosphorus transistors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 18:19:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 11:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

In this work, we further investigate this\ntype of phase transition and focus on the effect of long-range interactions.\nThis is achieved by introducing a non-local shear stress into the hydrodynamic\ndescription, which leads to superdiffusion of the velocity field, and can be\nviewed as a result of the active particles performing Levy walks. The universal\nproperties in the critical region are derived by performing a perturbative\nrenormalization group analysis of the corresponding response functional within\nthe one-loop approximation. We show that the effect of non-local shear stress\ndecreases the upper critical dimension of the model, and can lead to the\nirrelevance of the active fluid self-advection with the resulting model\nbelonging to an unusual 'long-range Model A' universality class not reported\nbefore. Moreover, when the degree of non-locality is sufficiently high all\nnon-linearities become irrelevant and the mean-field description is valid in\nany spatial dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 18:26:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

To overcome these\nshortcomings, we have developed a new type of low-cost fiber diffusers based on\na graded-scattering method in which the optical scattering of the fiber\ndiffuser is gradually increased as the light travels. The graded scattering can\ncompensate for the optical attenuation and provide relatively uniform light\nemission along the diffuser. We performed Monte Carlo numerical simulations to\noptimize several key design parameters, including the number of scattering\nsegments, scattering anisotropy factor, divergence angle of the optical fiber,\nand reflective index of the surrounding medium. These optimized parameters\ncollectively result in uniform light emission along the fiber diffuser and can\nbe flexibly adjusted to accommodate different applications. We fabricated and\ncharacterized the prototype fiber diffuser made of agarose gel and intralipid.\nEquipped with the new fiber diffuser, we performed thorough proof-of-concept\nstudies on ex vivo tissue phantoms and an in vivo swine model to demonstrate\nthe deep-imaging capability (~10 cm achieved ex vivo) of photoacoustic\ntomography.

However, developing such\nautomatic solutions is challenging due to the requirement of a large amount of\nhuman-annotated data. Recently, unsupervised/self-supervised feature learning\ntechniques receive a lot of attention, as they do not need massive annotations.\nMost of the current self-supervised methods are analyzed with single imaging\nmodality and there is no method currently utilize multi-modal images for better\nresults. Considering that the diagnostics of various vitreoretinal diseases can\ngreatly benefit from another imaging modality, e.g., FFA, this paper presents a\nnovel self-supervised feature learning method by effectively exploiting\nmulti-modal data for retinal disease diagnosis. To achieve this, we first\nsynthesize the corresponding FFA modality and then formulate a patient\nfeature-based softmax embedding objective. Our objective learns both\nmodality-invariant features and patient-similarity features. Through this\nmechanism, the neural network captures the semantically shared information\nacross different modalities and the apparent visual similarity between\npatients. We evaluate our method on two public benchmark datasets for retinal\ndisease diagnosis. The experimental results demonstrate that our method clearly\noutperforms other self-supervised feature learning methods and is comparable to\nthe supervised baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 19:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-23"}

The torque magnitude can overcome that of gas which may result\nin outward planetary migration.

We run two-dimensional, high-resolution (1.5Kx3K)\nglobal hydrodynamic simulations of an embedded low-mass planet in a\nprotoplanetary disc. The solid material is handled as a pressureless fluid.\nStrong accretion of well-coupled solid species by a M_p<0.3M_Earth protoplanet\nresults in the formation of such a strongly asymmetric solid pattern close to\nthe planet that the positive solid torque can overcome that of gas by two\ntimes. However, the accretion of solids in the pebble regime results in\nincreased magnitude negative torque felt by protoplanets and strengthened\npositive torque for Earth-mass planets.

Observations indicate a RM in the spiral arms that exceeds the commonly\nassumed range. This raises the question of under what conditions spiral arms\ncreate such strong RM. Aims: We investigate the effect of spiral arms on\nGalactic RMs through shock compression of the interstellar medium (ISM). It has\nrecently been suggested that the Sagittarius spiral arm creates a strong peak\nin RM where the line of sight (LOS) is tangent to the arm, and that enhanced RM\nfollows along an intersecting LOS. We seek to understand the physical\nconditions that give rise to this effect and the role of viewing geometry.\nMethods: We apply a MHD simulation of the multi-phase ISM in a Milky Way type\nspiral galaxy disk in combination with radiative transfer to evaluate different\ntracers of spiral arm structures. For observers embedded in the disk, dust\nintensity, synchrotron emission and the kinematics of molecular gas\nobservations are derived to identify spiral arm tangents. RMs are calculated\nthrough the disk and evaluated for different observer positions. The observer's\nperspective is related to the parameters of the local bubble surrounding the\nobserver. Results: We reproduce a scattering of tangent points for different\ntracers of about $6^\\circ$ per spiral arm similar to the Milky Way. As for the\nRM, the model shows that compression of the ISM and associated amplification of\nthe magnetic field in spiral arms enhances RM by a few hundred rad $m^{-2}$ on\ntop of the mean contribution of the disk. The arm-inter-arm contrast in RM\nalong the LOS is approximately 10 in the inner Galaxy, fading to ~2 in the\nouter Galaxy. We identify a shark-fin like pattern in the RM Milky Way\nobservations as well as the synthetic data that is characteristic for spiral\narms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 20:45:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

Needle based measurement\ntechniques such as Cavitation Rheology and Volume Controlled Cavity Expansion\n(VCCE), allow for minimally invasive local mechanical testing, but have been\nlimited to measuring the elastic material properties. Here, we propose several\nenhancements to the VCCE technique to adapt it for characterization of\nviscoelastic response at low to medium stretch rates ($10^{-2}$ - $1$\ns${}^{-1}$). The proposed technique performs several cycles of\nexpansion-relaxation at controlled stretch rates in a cavity expansion setting\nand then employs a large deformation viscoelastic model to capture the measured\nmaterial response. Application of the technique to soft PDMS rubber reveals\nsignificant rate dependent material response with high precision and\nrepeatability, while isolating equilibrated states that are used to directly\ninfer the quasistatic elastic modulus. The technique is further established by\ndemonstrating its ability to capture changes in the rate dependent material\nresponse of a tuneable PDMS system. The measured viscoelastic properties are\nused to explain earlier reports of rate insensitive material response by needle\nbased methods: it is demonstrated that the conventional use of constant\nvolumetric rate cavity expansion can induce high stretch rates that lead to\nviscoelastic stiffening and an illusion of rate insensitive material response.\nWe thus conclude with a cautionary note on possible overestimation of the\nquasistatic elastic modulus in previous studies and suggest that the stretch\nrate controlled expansion protocol, proposed in this work, is essential for\naccurate estimation of both quasistatic and dynamic material parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 21:10:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 21:02:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 18:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

However, in\nthe offline RL setting -- where a fixed collection of interactions are provided\nand no further interactions are allowed -- it has been shown that standard\noff-policy RL methods can significantly underperform. Recently proposed methods\noften aim to address this shortcoming by constraining learned policies to\nremain close to the given dataset of interactions. In this work, we closely\ninvestigate an important simplification of BCQ -- a prior approach for offline\nRL -- which removes a heuristic design choice and naturally restricts extracted\npolicies to remain exactly within the support of a given behavior policy.\nImportantly, in contrast to their original theoretical considerations, we\nderive this simplified algorithm through the introduction of a novel backup\noperator, Expected-Max Q-Learning (EMaQ), which is more closely related to the\nresulting practical algorithm. Specifically, in addition to the distribution\nsupport, EMaQ explicitly considers the number of samples and the proposal\ndistribution, allowing us to derive new sub-optimality bounds which can serve\nas a novel measure of complexity for offline RL problems. In the offline RL\nsetting -- the main focus of this work -- EMaQ matches and outperforms prior\nstate-of-the-art in the D4RL benchmarks. In the online RL setting, we\ndemonstrate that EMaQ is competitive with Soft Actor Critic. The key\ncontributions of our empirical findings are demonstrating the importance of\ncareful generative model design for estimating behavior policies, and an\nintuitive notion of complexity for offline RL problems.

A major problem affecting Isolation Forest is\nrepresented by the lack of interpretability, an effect of the inherent\nrandomness governing the splits performed by the Isolation Trees, the building\nblocks of the Isolation Forest. In this paper we propose effective, yet\ncomputationally inexpensive, methods to define feature importance scores at\nboth global and local level for the Isolation Forest. Moreover, we define a\nprocedure to perform unsupervised feature selection for Anomaly Detection\nproblems based on our interpretability method; such procedure also serves the\npurpose of tackling the challenging task of feature importance evaluation in\nunsupervised anomaly detection. We assess the performance on several synthetic\nand real-world datasets, including comparisons against state-of-the-art\ninterpretability techniques, and make the code publicly available to enhance\nreproducibility and foster research in the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 22:19:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 13:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

The classical unsupervised clustering strategy\nconcerns primarily the identification of subpopulations that have similar\npatterns in gene features. However, as the features corresponding to irrelevant\nconfounders (e.g. gender or age) may dominate the clustering process, the\nresulting clusters may or may not capture clinically meaningful disease\nsubtypes. This gives rise to a fundamental problem: can we find a subtyping\nprocedure guided by a pre-specified disease outcome? Existing methods, such as\nsupervised clustering, apply a two-stage approach and depend on an arbitrary\nnumber of selected features associated with outcome. In this paper, we propose\na unified latent generative model to perform outcome-guided disease subtyping\nconstructed from omics data, which improves the resulting subtypes concerning\nthe disease of interest. Feature selection is embedded in a regularization\nregression. A modified EM algorithm is applied for numerical computation and\nparameter estimation. The proposed method performs feature selection, latent\nsubtype characterization and outcome prediction simultaneously.

The presence of salt raises the polarity of the\nwater phase, favoring the salting out of the surfactant from the aqueous\nsolution and increasing its surface excess. Yet, the electrolyte also screens\nthe resulting surface charge of the drops [Debye-H\\\"uckel, 1923]. As a result,\nthe electrostatic surface potential increases with the ionic strength until the\nsaturation of the interface and then decreases. This behavior produces a\nmaximum previously observed in hexadecane-in-water nanoemulsions\n[Urbina-Villalba, 2013; 2015]. Here, the variation of the surface potential of\ntwo dodecane-in-water (d/w) nanoemulsions is evaluated as a function of the\nsodium chloride concentration. As expected, maximum values are obtained for\nconcentrations of 0.5 and 7.5 mM sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS). However, the\nsurface excess of dodecane drops shows an intermediate behavior between the\nadsorption equilibrium predicted by macroscopic adsorption isotherms, and the\none previously found on hexadecane drops. The stability of the prepared\nemulsions was followed monitoring the change in the average radius of the\ndispersions during five minutes, six times the lapse of time employed in a\ntypical evaluation of the aggregation rate. In the case of 7.5 mM SDS, the\nsmallest change in size coincides with the maximum surface potential found (40\nmM NaCl). This is not observed for 0.5 mM SDS.

We used two semilocal approximations, the\ngeneralized gradient approximation (GGA) by Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and\nthe strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA. In addition,\nwe utilized two nonlocal DFT functionals, the hybrid HSE06, and the\nstate-of-the-art random phase approximation (RPA). The nonlocal functionals\nsuch as HSE06 and RPA yield accurate formation energies of binary alloys with\ncompletely-filled d-band metals, where semilocal functionals underperform. The\naccuracy at the nonlocal functionals is greatly reduced when a partially-filled\nd-band metal is present in an alloy, while PBE-GGA outperforms in these cases.\nWe show that the accurate prediction of formation energies by any DFT method\ndepends on its ability to predict the accurate electronic properties, e.g.,\nvalence d-band contribution to the density of states (DOS). The SCAN meta-GGA\noften corrects the PBE-DOS, however, it does not provide accurate formation\nenergies compared to PBE. This is assumed to be due to the lack of proper error\ncancellation that should be expected due to the similar bulk nature of both\nalloys and their constituents, which may improve with the modification of\nmeta-GGA ingredients. RPA yields too negative formation energies of alloys with\npartially-filled d-band metals. RPA results can be corrected by restoring the\nexchange-correlation kernel, thereby improving the short-range\nelectron-electron correlation in metallic densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 00:57:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 00:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

However, presenting flicker on computer-controlled displays is\nproblematic; displays typically introduce luminance artifacts at high flicker\nfrequency or contrast, potentially interfering with the validity of findings.\nHere, we present a battery of tests used to weigh the relative merits of two\ndisplays for presenting achromatic, mean-modulated flicker. These tests\nrevealed marked differences between a new high-performance liquid-crystal\ndisplay (LCD; EIZO ColorEdge CG247X) and a new consumer-grade LCD (Dell\nU2415b), despite displays' vendor-supplied specifications being almost\nidentical. We measured displayed luminance using a spot meter and a linearized\nphotodiode. We derived several measures, including spatial uniformity, the\neffect of viewing angle, response times, Fourier amplitude spectra, and\ncycle-averaged luminance. We presented paired luminance pulses to quantify the\ndisplays' nonlinear dynamics. The CG247X showed relatively good spatial\nuniformity (e.g., at moderate luminance, standard deviation 2.8% versus\nU2415b's 5.3%). Fourier transformation of nominally static test patches\nrevealed spectra free of artifacts, with the exception of a frame response. The\nCG247X's rise and fall times depended on both the luminance from which, and to\nwhich, it responded, as is to be generally expected from LCDs. Despite this\nnonlinear behaviour, we were able to define a contrast and frequency range\nwherein the CG247X appeared largely artifact-free; the relationship between\nnominal luminance and displayed luminance was accurately modelled using a\ncausal, linear time-invariant system. This range included contrasts up to 80%,\nand flicker frequencies up to 30 Hz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 01:10:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 04:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

However, most knowledge graph embedding methods\nfocus on the structural relationships in fixed triples while ignoring the\ntemporal information. Currently, existing time-aware graph embedding methods\nonly focus on the factual plausibility, while ignoring the temporal smoothness\nwhich models the interactions between a fact and its contexts, and thus can\ncapture fine-granularity temporal relationships. This leads to the limited\nperformance of embedding related applications. To solve this problem, this\npaper presents a Robustly Time-aware Graph Embedding (RTGE) method by\nincorporating temporal smoothness. Two major innovations of our paper are\npresented here. At first, RTGE integrates a measure of temporal smoothness in\nthe learning process of the time-aware graph embedding.

Heuristically, one expects for a\nnearly stationary covariance matrix the entries in each subdiagonal of the\nCholesky factor of its inverse to be nearly the same in the sense that sum of\nabsolute values of successive terms is small. Statistically such smoothness is\nachieved by regularizing each subdiagonal using fused-type lasso penalties. We\nrely on the standard Cholesky factor as the new parameters within a regularized\nnormal likelihood setup which guarantees: (1) joint convexity of the likelihood\nfunction, (2) strict convexity of the likelihood function restricted to each\nsubdiagonal even when $n<p$, and (3) positive-definiteness of the estimated\ncovariance matrix. A block coordinate descent algorithm, where each block is a\nsubdiagonal, is proposed and its convergence is established under mild\nconditions. Lack of decoupling of the penalized likelihood function into a sum\nof functions involving individual subdiagonals gives rise to some computational\nchallenges and advantages relative to two recent algorithms for sparse\nestimation of the Cholesky factor which decouple row-wise.

Here we pose the\nquestion of how to mitigate pandemic costs subject to constraints by adopting\nthe language of optimal control theory. This allows us to determine top-down\npolicies for the nature and dynamics of social contact rates given an\nage-structured model for the dynamics of the disease. Depending on the relative\nweights allocated to life and socioeconomic losses, we see that the optimal\nstrategies range from long-term social-distancing only for the most vulnerable,\nto partial lockdown to ensure not over-running hospitals, to alternating-shifts\nwith significant reduction in life and/or socioeconomic losses. Crucially,\ncommonly used strategies that involve long periods of broad lockdown are almost\nnever optimal, as they are highly unstable to reopening and entail high\nsocioeconomic costs. Using parameter estimates from data available for Germany\nand the USA, we quantify these policies and use sensitivity analysis in the\nrelevant model parameters and initial conditions to determine the range of\nrobustness of our policies.

Using a fully coupled\natmosphere--land--ocean--sea-ice model with turning on or off sea-ice drift, a\ncircular orbit with no eccentricity (e=0) and an eccentric orbit (e=0.2) are\nexamined. When sea-ice drift is turned off, the stellar flux threshold for the\nsnowball onset is 1250--1275 and 1173--1199 W m^-2 for e=0 and 0.2,\nrespectively. The difference is mainly due to the poleward retreat of sea ice\nand snow edges when the planet is close to the perihelion in the eccentric\norbit. When sea-ice drift is turned on, the respective stellar flux threshold\nis 1335--1350 and 1250--1276 W m^-2. These mean that sea-ice drift increases\nthe snowball onset threshold by ~80 W m^-2 for both e=0 and 0.2, promoting the\nformation of a snowball climate state. We further show that oceanic dynamics\nhave a small effect, <26 W m^-2, on the snowball onset threshold. This is\nbecause oceanic heat transport becomes weaker and weaker as the sea ice edge is\napproaching the equator.

Security evaluation of ORAS\ngenerally involves quantifying information leaked via observed\nchallenge-response pairs. However, little work has evaluated information leaked\nvia human behavior while interacting with these schemes. A common way to\nachieve observation resilience is by including a modulus operation in the\ncognitive function. This minimizes the information leaked about the secret due\nto the many-to-one map from the set of possible secrets to a given response. In\nthis work, we show that user behavior can be used as a side-channel to obtain\nthe secret in such ORAS.

This article explores the notion of human control in the United\nStates in the two domains of defense and transportation. The operationalization\nof emerging policies of human control results in the typology of direct and\nindirect human controls exercised over the use of AS. The typology helps to\nsteer the debate away from the linguistic complexities of the term autonomy. It\nidentifies instead where human factors are undergoing important changes and\nultimately informs about more detailed rules and standards formulation, which\ndiffer across domains, applications, and sectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 06:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-23"}

Since the spatial scale of oceanic internal gravity waves is\ntypically much larger than that of turbulence, fully incorporating both in a\nmodel would require a high computational cost, and is therefore out of our\nscope. Alternatively, we cut out a small domain periodically distorted by an\nunresolved large-scale internal wave and locally simulate the energy cascade to\nthe smallest scales. In this model, even though the Froude number of the outer\nwave, $Fr$, is small such that density overturn or shear instability does not\noccur, a striped pattern of disturbance is exponentially amplified through a\nparametric subharmonic instability. When the disturbance amplitude grows\nsufficiently large, secondary instabilities arise and produce much\nsmaller-scale fluctuations. Passing through these two stages, wave energy is\ntransferred into turbulence energy and will be eventually dissipated. Different\nfrom the conventional scenarios of vertical shear-induced instabilities, a\nlarge part of turbulent potential energy is supplied from the outer wave and\ndirectly used for mixing. The mixing coefficient $\\Gamma=\\epsilon_P/\\epsilon$,\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the dissipation rate of kinetic energy and $\\epsilon_P$ is\nthat of available potential energy, is always greater than 0.5 and tends to\nincrease with $Fr$.

However, there exist intense\ndebates on the origin of broken inversion symmetry since the halide perovskites\ntypically crystallize into a centrosymmetric structure. In order to clarify the\nissue, we examine both dynamic and static effects in the all-inorganic CsPbBr3\nand organic-inorganic CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) perovskite single crystals by\nemploying temperature- and polarization-dependent photoluminescence excitation\nspectroscopy. The perovskite single crystals manifest the dynamic effect by\nphoton recycling in the indirect Rashba gap, causing dual peaks in the\nphotoluminescence. But the effect vanishes in CsPbBr3 at low temperatures (< 50\nK), accompanied by a striking color change of the crystal, arising presumably\nfrom lower degrees of freedom for inversion symmetry breaking associated with\nthe thermal motion of the spherical Cs cation, compared with the polar MA\ncation in MAPbBr3. We also show that static Rashba effect occurs only in\nMAPbBr3 below 90 K due to surface reconstruction via MA-cation ordering, which\nlikely extends across a few layers from the crystal surface to the interior.

Previous methods have shown their efficiency in\nface parsing, which however overlook the correlation among different face\nregions. The correlation is a critical clue about the facial appearance, pose,\nexpression etc., and should be taken into account for face parsing. To this\nend, we propose to model and reason the region-wise relations by learning graph\nrepresentations, and leverage the edge information between regions for\noptimized abstraction. Specifically, we encode a facial image onto a global\ngraph representation where a collection of pixels (\"regions\") with similar\nfeatures are projected to each vertex. Our model learns and reasons over\nrelations between the regions by propagating information across vertices on the\ngraph. Furthermore, we incorporate the edge information to aggregate the\npixel-wise features onto vertices, which emphasizes on the features around\nedges for fine segmentation along edges.

We found that the mode behavior can be separately classified for two\ndistinct cases: (1) flat nanodisks where the diameter is much less than the\nthickness; and (2) thick nanodisks where the diameter is comparable to the\nthickness. While the multipolar edge modes and breathing modes of flat\nnanostructures have previously been interpreted using intuitive, analytical\nmodels based on surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes of a thin-film stack, it\nhas been found that the true dispersion relation of the multipolar edge modes\ndeviates significantly from the SPP dispersion relation.

However, for the case of\nthick nanodisks, this effective wavelength theory breaks down, and such\nintuitive models are no longer viable. We found that this is because some modes\nof the thick nanodisks carry a polar (i.e. out of the substrate plane, or along\nthe electron beam direction) dependence and cannot be simply categorized as\nradial breathing modes or angular (azimuthal) multipolar edge modes.

A good solution is to\nleverage the technique of manifold regularization to utilize the previous\nsimilar data to assist the refinement of the online model.

We restrict ourselves to applying a weak probe field\nand three strong coupling fields to the medium, which leads to developing a\nfour-level double $V$-type atomic system. We first regard all the three strong\ncoupling fields as the plane-waves and calculate an analytical expression for\nthe group velocity of the probe LG field on the optical axis at the waist of\nthe field. It appears that the resulting formula in a dispersive medium is in\ngood agreement with that of the free space. We also find a more general\nanalytical expression for the group velocity of the probe LG field out of the\noptical axis and compare with its projection onto the propagation axis. It is\nturned out that these two quantities are equal on the optical axis, at the\nwaist of the beam and the Rayleigh range. Finally, we assume one of the strong\ncoupling fields to be an LG field and explore how its orbital angular momentum\n(OAM) affects the group velocity of the probe LG field. Our analysis predicts a\nstrange behavior for the group velocity of the probe LG field inside a normal\ndispersive medium so that it can exceed the speed of light in free space. Such\nan unusual propagation of the LG light beam results from the distortion of its\nhelical phase front via the classical interference of the planar and LG fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 09:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-23"}

Iterated function systems satisfying these\nproperties were shown to exist by the author and by B\\'{a}r\\'{a}ny and\nK\\\"{a}enm\\\"{a}ki. In this paper we prove a general theorem on the existence of\nsuch iterated function systems within a parameterised family. This theorem\nshows that if a parameterised family contains two independent subfamilies, and\nthe set of parameters that cause exact overlaps satisfies some weak topological\nassumptions, then the original family will contain an iterated function system\nsatisfying the desired properties. We include several explicit examples of\nparameterised families to which this theorem can be applied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 09:23:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-23"}

The regulations describe requirements that seem to be\nopposite to efficient software development and short time-to-market. As agile\napproaches, like DevOps, are becoming more and more popular in software\nindustry, a discrepancy between these modern methods and traditional regulated\ndevelopment has been reported. Although examples of successful adoption in this\ncontext exist, the research is sparse. Aims: The objective of this study is\ntwofold: to review the current state of DevOps adoption in regulated medical\ndevice environment; and to propose a checklist based on that review for\nintroducing DevOps in that context. Method: A multivocal literature review is\nperformed and evidence is synthesized from sources published between 2015 to\nMarch of 2020 to capture the opinions of experts and community in this field.\nResults: Our findings reveal that adoption of DevOps in a regulated medical\ndevice environment such as ISO 13485 has its challenges, but potential benefits\nmay outweigh those in areas such as regulatory, compliance, security,\norganizational and technical. Conclusion: DevOps for regulated medical device\nenvironments is a highly appealing approach as compared to traditional methods\nand could be particularly suited for regulated medical development. However, an\norganization must properly anchor a transition to DevOps in top-level\nmanagement and be supportive in the initial phase utilizing professional\ncoaching and space for iterative learning; as such an initiative is a complex\norganizational and technical task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 09:29:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-23"}

Previous results describing the\ncirculation in a single rotating star and a binary star are used to deduce a\nnew prescription for the internal circulation in tidally locked binaries. We\nexplore the effect of this prescription numerically for binary systems with\nprimary masses between 25 and 100 solar masses. When comparing circulation\nvelocities in the radial direction for the single rotating star and binary\nstar, it is found that the average circulation velocity in the binary star may\nbe described as an enhancement to the circulation velocity in a single rotating\nstar. This velocity enhancement is a simple function depending on the masses of\nthe binary components and amounts to a factor of approximately two when the\ncomponents have equal masses. It is found that the ehancement causes the\nformation of double helium stars through efficient mixing to occur for systems\nwith higher initial orbital periods, lower primary masses and lower mass\nratios, compared to the standard circulation scenario. Taking into account\nappropriate distributions for primary mass, initial period and mass ratio,\nmodels with enhanced mixing predict 2.4 times more double helium stars being\nproduced in the parameter space than models without. We conclude that the\neffects of companion-induced circulation have strong implications for the\nformation of close binary black holes. Not only do the predicted detection\nrates increase but double black-hole systems with mass ratios as low as 0.8 may\nbe formed when companion-induced circulation is taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 09:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

Compression-based entropies have been\nproved useful in recent years in describing the different phases of\nout-of-equilibrium systems.

Furthermore, we unveil the subtle role of the time\ncoordinate, unexplored in previous studies on the CID: a new encoding recipe,\nwhere space and time locality are both preserved on the same ground, is\ndemonstrated to reduce the CID.

It is often\nargued that people use trust as a cognitive shortcut to reduce the complexity\nof such interactions. Here we formalise this by using the methods of\nevolutionary game theory to study the viability of trust-based strategies in\nrepeated games. These are reciprocal strategies that cooperate as long as the\nother player is observed to be cooperating. Unlike classic reciprocal\nstrategies, once mutual cooperation has been observed for a threshold number of\nrounds they stop checking their co-player's behaviour every round, and instead\nonly check with some probability. By doing so, they reduce the opportunity cost\nof verifying whether the action of their co-player was actually cooperative. We\ndemonstrate that these trust-based strategies can outcompete strategies that\nare always conditional, such as Tit-for-Tat, when the opportunity cost is\nnon-negligible. We argue that this cost is likely to be greater when the\ninteraction is between people and intelligent agents, because of the reduced\ntransparency of the agent. Consequently, we expect people to use trust-based\nstrategies more frequently in interactions with intelligent agents.

To ensure that self-driving vehicles\nencounter all possible scenarios, several millions of hours of testing must be\ncarried out; therefore, testing self-driving vehicles in the real world is\nimpractical. There is also the issue that testing self-driving vehicles\ndirectly in the traffic poses a potential safety hazard to human drivers. To\ntackle this challenge, validation frameworks for testing self-driving vehicles\nin simulated scenarios are being developed by academia and industry. In this\nchapter, we briefly introduce self-driving vehicles and give an overview of\nvalidation frameworks for testing them in a simulated environment. We conclude\nby discussing what an ideal validation framework at the state of the art should\nbe and what could benefit validation frameworks for self-driving vehicles in\nthe future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 11:22:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

Due to the indistinct\nboundaries and heterogeneous intensity distributions in the cardiac MRI, most\nexisting methods still suffer from two aspects of challenges: inter-class\nindistinction and intra-class inconsistency. To tackle these two problems, we\npropose a novel method to exploit the directional feature maps, which can\nsimultaneously strengthen the differences between classes and the similarities\nwithin classes. Specifically, we perform cardiac segmentation and learn a\ndirection field pointing away from the nearest cardiac tissue boundary to each\npixel via a direction field (DF) module. Based on the learned direction field,\nwe then propose a feature rectification and fusion (FRF) module to improve the\noriginal segmentation features, and obtain the final segmentation. The proposed\nmodules are simple yet effective and can be flexibly added to any existing\nsegmentation network without excessively increasing time and space complexity.\nWe evaluate the proposed method on the 2017 MICCAI Automated Cardiac Diagnosis\nChallenge (ACDC) dataset and a large-scale self-collected dataset, showing good\nsegmentation performance and robust generalization ability of the proposed\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 11:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-23"}

In general, they use 3.5 to 4.5 times less parameters and 1.5 to 1.8\ntimes less computational costs when compared to the state-of-the-art methods.\nFurthermore, their feature learning capabilities are significantly better than\nthe conventional 3D convolutional layer and its variants. Our extensive\nevaluation on seven action recognition datasets, including Something-something\nv1 and v2, Jester, Diving-48, Kinetics-400, UCF 101, and HMDB 51, demonstrate\nthat STFT blocks based 3D CNNs achieve on par or even better performance\ncompared to the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 12:26:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

The outburst lasted\napproximately four months. Spectral modelling in the 0.3-10 keV band shows the\npresence of both a soft thermal and a hard Comptonised component. The analysis\nof these components shows that MAXI J1727-203 evolved through the soft,\nintermediate and hard spectral states during the outburst. We find that the\nsoft (disc) component was detected throughout almost the entire outburst, with\ntemperatures ranging from ~0.4 keV, at the moment of maximum luminosity, to\n~0.1 keV near the end of the outburst. The power spectrum in the hard and\nintermediate states shows broadband noise up to 20 Hz, with no evidence of\nquasi-periodic oscillations. We also study the rms spectra of the broadband\nnoise at 0.3-10 keV of this source. We find that the fractional rms increases\nwith energy in most of the outburst except during the hard state, where the\nfractional rms remains approximately constant with energy. We also find that,\nbelow 3 keV, the fractional rms follows the same trend generally observed at\nenergies >3 keV, a behaviour known from previous studies of black holes and\nneutron stars. The spectral and timing evolution of MAXI J1727-203, as\nparametrised by the hardness-intensity, hardness-rms, and rms-intensity\ndiagrams, suggest that the system hosts a black hole, although we could not\nrule out a neutron star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 12:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

This work aims to investigate and address any systematic\ndifferences affecting the comparison of simulations with observations. To this\naim, we analyzed a set of 24 realistically simulated MoRIA (Models of Realistic\ndwarfs In Action) dwarf galaxies in an observationally motivated way.

Then we used the CMD-fitting\nmethod to recover their star-formation histories (SFHs) from their observed\nCMDs. These solved SFHs were then directly compared to the true SFHs from the\nsimulation star-particle data, mainly in terms of the star-formation rate(SFR)\nand the age-metallicity relation (AMR). We applied a dust extinction\nprescription to the simulation data to produce observed CMDs affected by dust\nin star-formation regions. Since future facilities, such as the JWST and E-ELT\nwill focus on the near IR rather than the optical, we also constructed and\nanalyzed CMDs using the I- and H-bands. We find a very good agreement between\nthe recovered and the true SFHs of all the simulated dwarf galaxies in our\nsample, from the synthetic CMD analysis of their V-I versus I as well as the\nI-H versus H CMDs. Dust leads to an underestimation of the SFR during the last\nfew hundred million years.

Meanwhile, such techniques can\nbe extremely time-consuming due to manipulation of the program code to\nfabricate a large number of patches and also repeated executions of tests on\npatches to identify potential fixes. PraPR, a recent G&V APR technique, reduces\nthese costs by modifying program code directly at the level of compiled\nbytecode, and further performing on-the-fly patching by allowing multiple\npatches to be tested within the same JVM session. However, PraPR is limited due\nto its pattern-based, bytecode-level nature and it is basically\nunsound/imprecise as it assumes that patch executions do not change global JVM\nstate and affect later patch executions on the same JVM session. Inspired by\nthe PraPR work, we propose a unified patch validation framework, named UniAPR,\nwhich aims to speed up the patch validation for both bytecode and source-code\nAPR via on-the-fly patching; furthermore, UniAPR addresses the imprecise patch\nvalidation issue by resetting the JVM global state via runtime bytecode\ntransformation. We have implemented UniAPR as a fully automated Maven Plugin.\nWe have also performed the first study of on-the-fly patch validation for\nstate-of-the-art source-code-level APR. Our experiments show the first\nempirical evidence that vanilla on-the-fly patch validation can be\nimprecise/unsound; in contrast, our UniAPR framework can speed up\nstate-of-the-art APR by over an order of magnitude without incurring any\nimprecision in patch validation, enabling all existing APR techniques to\nexplore a larger search space to fix more bugs in the near future. Furthermore,\nUniAPR directly enables hybrid source and bytecode APR to fix substantially\nmore bugs than all state-of-the-art APR techniques (under the same time limit)\nin the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 14:08:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-23"}

However,\nits vulnerability against presentation attacks poses a significant security\nthreat. Though presentation attack detection (PAD) methods try to address this\nissue, they often fail in generalizing to unseen attacks. In this work, we\npropose a new framework for PAD using a one-class classifier, where the\nrepresentation used is learned with a Multi-Channel Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (MCCNN). A novel loss function is introduced, which forces the network\nto learn a compact embedding for bonafide class while being far from the\nrepresentation of attacks. A one-class Gaussian Mixture Model is used on top of\nthese embeddings for the PAD task. The proposed framework introduces a novel\napproach to learn a robust PAD system from bonafide and available (known)\nattack classes. This is particularly important as collecting bonafide data and\nsimpler attacks are much easier than collecting a wide variety of expensive\nattacks. The proposed system is evaluated on the publicly available WMCA\nmulti-channel face PAD database, which contains a wide variety of 2D and 3D\nattacks.

Important for any model\nis the explanation of the multiyear, accurate astrometric data of S2 and the\nchallenging G2: its post-pericenter velocity decelerates faster than expected\nfrom a Keplerian orbit around the putative BH. This has been reconciled in the\nliterature by acting on G2 a drag force by an accretion flow.

The coupling is shown to be strongly dependent not only on the\nexcitation vector fields and sample's magnetic properties but also on the\nsample's shape. These findings are illustrated by applying the theoretical\nframework to two distinct experiments: a magnetic sphere placed in a\nthree-dimensional resonator, and a rectangular, magnetic prism placed on a\ntwo-dimensional resonator. The theory provides comprehensive understanding of\nthe overall behaviour of strongly coupled systems and it can be easily modified\nfor a variety of other systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 15:05:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2020 22:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

CT/MRI is one of the most common medical image fusion.\nThese medical modalities give information about different diseases.\nComplementary information is offered by CT and MRI.

A robust and automatic early recognition of\nCOVID-19, via auxiliary computer-aided diagnostic tools, is essential for\ndisease cure and control. The chest radiography images, such as Computed\nTomography (CT) and X-ray, and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can\nbe a significant and useful material for designing such tools. However,\ndesigning such an automated tool is challenging as a massive number of manually\nannotated datasets are not publicly available yet, which is the core\nrequirement of supervised learning systems. In this article, we propose a\nrobust CNN-based network, called CVR-Net (Coronavirus Recognition Network), for\nthe automatic recognition of the coronavirus from CT or X-ray images. The\nproposed end-to-end CVR-Net is a multi-scale-multi-encoder ensemble model,\nwhere we have aggregated the outputs from two different encoders and their\ndifferent scales to obtain the final prediction probability. We train and test\nthe proposed CVR-Net on three different datasets, where the images have\ncollected from different open-source repositories.

The generalized Gauss-Newton method is an\noptimization method that is used in several popular Bayesian deep learning\nalgorithms. Algorithms that combine the Gauss-Newton method with the Laplace\nand Gaussian variational approximation have recently led to state-of-the-art\nresults in Bayesian deep learning. While the Laplace and Gaussian variational\napproximation have been studied extensively, their interplay with the\nGauss-Newton method remains unclear. Recent criticism of priors and posterior\napproximations in Bayesian deep learning further urges the need for a deeper\nunderstanding of practical algorithms. The individual analysis of the\nGauss-Newton method and Laplace and Gaussian variational approximations for\nneural networks provides both theoretical insight and new practical algorithms.\nWe find that the Gauss-Newton method simplifies the underlying probabilistic\nmodel significantly. In particular, the combination of the Gauss-Newton method\nwith approximate inference can be cast as inference in a linear or Gaussian\nprocess model. The Laplace and Gaussian variational approximation can\nsubsequently provide a posterior approximation to these simplified models. This\nnew disentangled understanding of recent Bayesian deep learning algorithms also\nleads to new methods: first, the connection to Gaussian processes enables new\nfunction-space inference algorithms. Second, we present a marginal likelihood\napproximation of the underlying probabilistic model to tune neural network\nhyperparameters. Finally, the identified underlying models lead to different\nmethods to compute predictive distributions. In fact, we find that these\nprediction methods for Bayesian neural networks often work better than the\ndefault choice and solve a common issue with the Laplace approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 17:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-24"}

The unique CNN consists of 7 convolution layers involving\nonly 108 kernels and 20308 trainable parameters. It is custom-designed,\nfollowing the proposed paradigm of ASCNN (application specific CNN), to perform\nmono-modality and cross-modality feature extraction, tumor localization and\npixel classification.

In this specific design context, the number\nof kernels in each of the 7 layers is made to be just-sufficient for its task,\ninstead of exponentially growing over the layers, to increase information\ndensity and to reduce randomness in the processing.

While a classical\nlabelling-based approach applies globally uniform conditions as to how an\nargument is to be labelled, they can be determined more locally per argument.\nAbstract dialectical frameworks (ADF) is a well-known argumentation formalism\nthat belongs to this category, offering a greater labelling flexibility. As the\nsize of an argumentation increases in the numbers of arguments and\nargument-to-argument relations, however, it becomes increasingly more costly to\ncheck whether a labelling function satisfies those local conditions or even\nwhether the conditions are as per the intention of those who had specified\nthem.

In this work, after quantifying\nmemory and computational requirements of CL algorithms, we define a novel HW/SW\nextreme-edge platform featuring a low power RISC-V octa-core cluster tailored\nfor on-demand incremental learning over locally sensed data. The presented\nmulti-core HW/SW architecture achieves a peak performance of 2.21 and 1.70\nMAC/cycle, respectively, when running forward and backward steps of the\ngradient descent. We report the trade-off between memory footprint, latency,\nand accuracy for learning a new class with Latent Replay CL when targeting an\nimage classification task on the CORe50 dataset. For a CL setting that retrains\nall the layers, taking 5h to learn a new class and achieving up to 77.3% of\nprecision, a more efficient solution retrains only part of the network,\nreaching an accuracy of 72.5% with a memory requirement of 300 MB and a\ncomputation latency of 1.5 hours. On the other side, retraining only the last\nlayer results in the fastest (867 ms) and less memory hungry (20 MB) solution\nbut scoring 58% on the CORe50 dataset. Thanks to the parallelism of the\nlow-power cluster engine, our HW/SW platform results 25x faster than typical\nMCU device, on which CL is still impractical, and demonstrates an 11x gain in\nterms of energy consumption with respect to mobile-class solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 11:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

Moreover, we show that maximum power density occurs when the area\nratio between cooler and P or N element reaches an optimal value. Finally, we\nperform a parametric study that takes account of environmental and structural\nparameters to improve the performance of the RC-TE device, including enhancing\nheat transfer between the hot surface and ambient air, suppressing the cooling\nloss of the radiative cooler, and optimizing the geometry of individual\nthermocouples. Our work identifies how to maximize the output of RC-TE devices\nand provides comprehensive guidance on making use of this new passive power\ngeneration method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 01:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

It is\nof utmost importance to identify the future infected cases and the virus spread\nrate for advance preparation in the healthcare services to avoid deaths.\nAccurately forecasting the spread of COVID-19 is an analytical and challenging\nreal-world problem to the research community. Therefore, we use day level\ninformation of COVID-19 spread for cumulative cases from whole world and 10\nmostly affected countries; US, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Russia, Iran,\nUnited Kingdom, Turkey, and India. We utilize the temporal data of coronavirus\nspread from January 22, 2020 to May 20, 2020. We model the evolution of the\nCOVID-19 outbreak, and perform prediction using ARIMA and Prophet time series\nforecasting models. Effectiveness of the models are evaluated based on the mean\nabsolute error, root mean square error, root relative squared error, and mean\nabsolute percentage error. Our analysis can help in understanding the trends of\nthe disease outbreak, and provide epidemiological stage information of adopted\ncountries. Our investigations show that ARIMA model is more effective for\nforecasting COVID-19 prevalence. The forecasting results have potential to\nassist governments to plan policies to contain the spread of the virus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 08:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}
