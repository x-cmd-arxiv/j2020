We provide a detailed description of how to\ncombine Keldysh and Floquet formalisms to account for the critical fluctuations\nin the weakly and rapidly driven regime. A key insight is that a reduction to\nthe time-averaged, static sector, is not possible close to the critical point.\nThis guides the design of a perturbative dynamic RG approach, which treats the\ntime-dependent, dynamic sector associated to higher harmonics of the drive, on\nan equal footing with the time-averaged sector. Within this framework, we\ndevelop a weak drive expansion scheme, which enables to systematically truncate\nthe RG flow equations in powers of the inverse drive frequency $\\Omega^{-1}$.\nThis allows us to show how a periodic drive inhibits scale invariance and\ncritical fluctuations of second order phase transitions in rapidly driven open\nsystems: Although criticality emerges in the limit $\\Omega^{-1}=0$, any finite\ndrive frequency produces a scale that remains finite all through the phase\ntransition. This is a universal mechanism that relies on the competition of the\ncritical fluctuations within the static and dynamic sectors of the problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2020 16:02:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 17:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

Several experiments demonstrate that both cyberattacks produce a\nreduction of spikes compared to spontaneous behavior, generating a rise in\ntemporal shifts and a dispersion increase. Mainly, SCA presents a higher impact\nthan FLO in the metrics focused on the number of spikes and dispersion, where\nFLO is slightly more damaging, considering the percentage of shifts.\nNevertheless, the intrinsic behavior of each attack generates a differentiation\non how they alter neuronal signaling.

However, most of the current\narbitrary-shape scene text spotters use region proposal networks (RPN) to\nproduce proposals. RPN relies heavily on manually designed anchors and its\nproposals are represented with axis-aligned rectangles. The former presents\ndifficulties in handling text instances of extreme aspect ratios or irregular\nshapes, and the latter often includes multiple neighboring instances into a\nsingle proposal, in cases of densely oriented text. To tackle these problems,\nwe propose Mask TextSpotter v3, an end-to-end trainable scene text spotter that\nadopts a Segmentation Proposal Network (SPN) instead of an RPN. Our SPN is\nanchor-free and gives accurate representations of arbitrary-shape proposals. It\nis therefore superior to RPN in detecting text instances of extreme aspect\nratios or irregular shapes. Furthermore, the accurate proposals produced by SPN\nallow masked RoI features to be used for decoupling neighboring text instances.\nAs a result, our Mask TextSpotter v3 can handle text instances of extreme\naspect ratios or irregular shapes, and its recognition accuracy won't be\naffected by nearby text or background noise. Specifically, we outperform\nstate-of-the-art methods by 21.9 percent on the Rotated ICDAR 2013 dataset\n(rotation robustness), 5.9 percent on the Total-Text dataset (shape\nrobustness), and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MSRA-TD500 dataset\n(aspect ratio robustness).

We demonstrate that the scaling properties of consecutive particle\npairs in the PCPD are identical with that of the A species in the coupled\nmodel. This two-species picture resolves the conceptual difficulty for seed\nsimulations in the original PCPD and naturally introduces multiple length and\ntime scales, which cause strong corrections to scaling. The extracted moment\nratios from our simulations indicate that our model displays the same temporal\ncrossover behavior as the PCPD, which further corroborates its full dynamical\nequivalence with our coupled model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2020 18:58:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 16:41:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 20:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

While product-level ratings are too generic, feature-level\nratings are particular; we exactly know what is good or bad about the product.\nThere has always been a need to know which features fall short or are doing\nwell according to the customer's perception. It keeps both the manufacturer and\nthe customer well-informed in the decisions to make in improving the product\nand buying, respectively. Different customers are interested in different\nfeatures. Thus, feature-level ratings can make buying decisions personalized.\nWe analyze the customer reviews collected on an online shopping site (Amazon)\nabout various mobile products and the review votes. Explicitly, we carry out a\nfeature-focused sentiment analysis for this purpose. Eventually, our analysis\nyields ratings to 108 features for 4k+ mobiles sold online.

The supernova feedback is implemented\nwith real supernovae that are the natural evolution of the resolved massive\nstars, so their position and timing are self-consistent. We select a large\nsample of molecular clouds from the simulation to investigate the supernova\nenergy injection and the resulting properties of molecular clouds. We find that\nmolecular clouds have a lifetime of a few dynamical times, less then half of\nthem contract to the point of becoming gravitationally bound, and the dispersal\ntime of bound clouds, of order one dynamical time, is a factor of two shorter\nthan that of unbound clouds. We stress the importance of internal supernovae,\nthat is massive stars that explode inside their parent cloud, in setting the\ncloud dispersal time, and their huge overdensity compared to models where the\nsupernovae are randomly distributed. We also quantify the energy injection\nefficiency of supernovae as a function of supernova distance to the clouds. We\nconclude that intermittent driving by supernovae can maintain molecular-cloud\nturbulence and may be the main process of cloud dispersal.

In 2016, due to low concentrations of memberships\nand far distance from the depot, certain minority neighborhoods were excluded\nfrom receiving Amazon's SDD service, raising concerns about fairness. In this\npaper, we study the problem of offering fair SDD-service to customers. The\nservice area is partitioned into different regions. Over the course of a day,\ncustomers request for SDD service, and the timing of requests and delivery\nlocations are not known in advance. The dispatcher dynamically assigns vehicles\nto make deliveries to accepted customers before their delivery deadline.

To address this concern, we propose the\nnovel LsrGAN, a generative model that Leverages the Semantic Relationship\nbetween seen and unseen categories and explicitly performs knowledge transfer\nby incorporating a novel Semantic Regularized Loss (SR-Loss). The SR-loss\nguides the LsrGAN to generate visual features that mirror the semantic\nrelationships between seen and unseen classes. Experiments on seven benchmark\ndatasets, including the challenging Wikipedia text-based CUB and NABirds\nsplits, and Attribute-based AWA, CUB, and SUN, demonstrates the superiority of\nthe LsrGAN compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches under both ZSL and\nGZSL.

Indeed, during external validation\nthrough training on AREDS and testing on AREDS2 as an independent cohort, our\nmodel retained substantially higher prognostic accuracy than existing clinical\nstandards. These results highlight the potential of deep learning systems to\nenhance clinical decision-making in AMD patients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 01:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

However, no equivalent understanding of dreams\nhas emerged. Contemporary neuroscientific theories generally view dreams as\nepiphenomena, and the few proposals for their biological function are\ncontradicted by the phenomenology of dreams themselves. Now, the recent advent\nof deep neural networks (DNNs) has finally provided the novel conceptual\nframework within which to understand the evolved function of dreams. Notably,\nall DNNs face the issue of overfitting as they learn, which is when performance\non one data set increases but the network's performance fails to generalize\n(often measured by the divergence of performance on training vs. testing data\nsets). This ubiquitous problem in DNNs is often solved by modelers via \"noise\ninjections\" in the form of noisy or corrupted inputs. The goal of this paper is\nto argue that the brain faces a similar challenge of overfitting, and that\nnightly dreams evolved to combat the brain's overfitting during its daily\nlearning. That is, dreams are a biological mechanism for increasing\ngeneralizability via the creation of corrupted sensory inputs from stochastic\nactivity across the hierarchy of neural structures. Sleep loss, specifically\ndream loss, leads to an overfitted brain that can still memorize and learn but\nfails to generalize appropriately. Herein this \"overfitted brain hypothesis\" is\nexplicitly developed and then compared and contrasted with existing\ncontemporary neuroscientific theories of dreams.

The PIoU loss is derived from\nIoU metric with a pixel-wise form, which is simple and suitable for both\nhorizontal and oriented bounding box.

However, little research attention is paid to the potential\nand practice of immunization to adversarial attacks on graphs. In this paper,\nwe propose and formulate the graph adversarial immunization problem, i.e.,\nvaccinating an affordable fraction of node pairs, connected or unconnected, to\nimprove the certifiable robustness of graph against any admissible adversarial\nattack. We further propose an effective algorithm, called AdvImmune, which\noptimizes with meta-gradient in a discrete way to circumvent the\ncomputationally expensive combinatorial optimization when solving the\nadversarial immunization problem. Experiments are conducted on two citation\nnetworks and one social network. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed AdvImmune method remarkably improves the ratio of robust nodes by 12%,\n42%, 65%, with an affordable immune budget of only 5% edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 10:41:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 09:25:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 01:28:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 06:54:55 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 08:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

As a reference instrument, we adopt the example of a robotic\n50 cm telescope, which is under construction at the Observatoire de la C\\^ote d\nAzur.

The currently increasing knowledge of the shape, spin\nproperties, and size, must be used to mitigate this source of error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 13:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

The suggested method is applied to a\nbluff body in a two-dimensional flow setup with and without a splitter plate.\nBy reducing the velocity fluctuations, there are estimated increases in the\nbase pressure of up to 58 % for the bluff body in two-dimensional flow without\na splitter plate and up to 42 % with a splitter plate. The estimated base\npressure of the two-dimensional flow without a splitter plate is compared to a\ncase with active flow control. In this case, the velocity fluctuations caused\nby the K\\'arm\\'an vortex street are reduced. The comparison shows that the\nestimation of the base pressure can be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 13:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

Recent\nscholarship has shown that the social media ecosystem can affect political\nthinking and expression. Individuals and groups across the political spectrum\nhave engaged in the use of these platforms extensively, even creating their own\nforums with varying approaches to content moderation in pursuit of freer\nstandards of speech. The Gab social media platform arose in this context. Gab\nis a social media platform for the so-called alt right, and much of the popular\npress has opined about the thematic content of discourses on Gab and platforms\nlike it, but little research has examined the content itself. Using a publicly\navailable dataset of all Gab posts from August 2016 until July 2019, the\ncurrent paper explores a five percent random sample of this dataset to explore\nthematic content on the platform. We run multiple structural topic models,\nusing standard procedures to arrive at an optimal k number of topics. The final\nmodel specifies 85 topics for 403,469 documents. We include as prevalence\nvariables whether the source account has been flagged as a bot and the number\nof followers for the source account. Results suggest the most nodal topics in\nthe dataset pertain to the authenticity of the Holocaust, the meaning of red\npill, and the journalistic merit of mainstream media. We conclude by discussing\nthe implications of our findings for work in ethical content moderation, online\ncommunity development, political polarization, and avenues for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 15:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

The NMPC strategy is designed upon an adapted data-driven\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) contagion model, which takes\ninto account the effects of social distancing. Furthermore, the adapted SIRD\nmodel includes time-varying auto-regressive contagion parameters, which\ndynamically converge according to the stage of the pandemic. This new model is\nidentified through a three-layered procedures, with analytical regressions,\nLeast-Squares optimization runs and auto-regressive model fits. The data-driven\nmodel is validated and shown to adequately describe the contagion curves over\nlarge forecast horizons. In this model, control input is defined as finitely\nparametrized values for social distancing guidelines, which directly affect the\ntransmission and infection rates of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The NMPC strategy\ngenerates piece-wise constant quarantine guidelines which can be\nrelaxed/strengthen as each week passes. The implementation of the method is\npursued through a search mechanism, since the control is finitely parametrized\nand, thus, there exist a finite number of possible control sequences.\nSimulation essays are shown to illustrate the results obtained with the\nproposed closed-loop NMPC strategy, which is able to mitigate the number of\ninfections and progressively loosen social distancing measures. With respect to\nan \"open-loop\"/no control condition, the number of deaths still could be\nreduced in up to 30 %. The forecast preview an infection peak to September 2nd,\n2020, which could lead to over 1.5 million deaths if no coordinate health\npolicy is enacted. The framework serves as guidelines for possible public\nhealth policies in Brazil.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 15:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

Attention mechanism applied on\nthe neighborhood of a node improves the performance of graph neural networks.\nTypically, it helps to identify a neighbor node which plays more important role\nto determine the label of the node under consideration. But in real world\nscenarios, a particular subset of nodes together, but not the individual pairs\nin the subset, may be important to determine the label of the graph. To address\nthis problem, we introduce the concept of subgraph attention for graphs. On the\nother hand, hierarchical graph pooling has been shown to be promising in recent\nliterature. But due to noisy hierarchical structure of real world graphs, not\nall the hierarchies of a graph play equal role for graph classification.\nTowards this end, we propose a graph classification algorithm called\nSubGattPool which jointly learns the subgraph attention and employs two\ndifferent types of hierarchical attention mechanisms to find the important\nnodes in a hierarchy and the importance of individual hierarchies in a graph.\nExperimental evaluation with different types of graph classification algorithms\nshows that SubGattPool is able to improve the state-of-the-art or remains\ncompetitive on multiple publicly available graph classification datasets. We\nconduct further experiments on both synthetic and real world graph datasets to\njustify the usefulness of different components of SubGattPool and to show its\nconsistent performance on other downstream tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 10:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}
