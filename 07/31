In this work, we\npresent a novel framework of continual learning named \"Bilevel Continual\nLearning\" (BCL) by unifying a {\\it bilevel optimization} objective and a {\\it\ndual memory management} strategy comprising both episodic memory and\ngeneralization memory to achieve effective knowledge transfer to future tasks\nand alleviate catastrophic forgetting on old tasks simultaneously.

COVID-19 also caused the\noverwhelming majority of information workers to rapidly shift to working from\nhome (WFH). The central question this work addresses is: can we isolate the\neffects of WFH on information workers' collaboration activities from all other\nfactors, especially the other effects of COVID-19? This is important because in\nthe future, WFH will likely to be more common than it was prior to the\npandemic.\n  We use difference-in-differences (DiD), a causal identification strategy\ncommonly used in the social sciences, to control for unobserved confounding\nfactors and estimate the causal effect of WFH. Our analysis relies on measuring\nthe difference in changes between those who WFH prior to COVID-19 and those who\ndid not. Our preliminary results suggest that on average, people spent more\ntime on collaboration in April (Post WFH mandate) than in February (Pre WFH\nmandate), but this is primarily due to factors other than WFH, such as\nlockdowns during the pandemic. The change attributable to WFH specifically is\nin the opposite direction: less time on collaboration and more focus time. This\nreversal shows the importance of using causal inference: a simple analysis\nwould have resulted in the wrong conclusion. We further find that the effect of\nWFH is moderated by individual remote collaboration experience prior to WFH.\nMeanwhile, the medium for collaboration has also shifted due to WFH: instant\nmessages were used more, whereas scheduled meetings were used less. We discuss\ndesign implications -- how future WFH may affect focused work, collaborative\nwork, and creative work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 16:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

These variables can be obtained in\nprinciple from near-horizon measurements of various astrophysical processes,\nthus potentially enabling efficient tests of both black-hole properties and the\ntheory of general relativity in the strong-field regime. Here, we extend this\nframework to allow for the parametrization of arbitrary asymptotically-flat,\nspherically symmetric metrics and introduce the notion of a 11-dimensional\n(11D) parametrization space $\\Pi$, on which each solution can be visualised as\na curve or surface. An $\\mathscr{L}^2$ norm on this space is used to measure\nthe deviation of a particular compact object solution from the Schwarzschild\nblack-hole solution. We calculate various observables, related to particle and\nphoton orbits, within this framework and demonstrate that the relative errors\nwe obtain are low (about $10^{-6}$). In particular, we obtain the innermost\nstable circular orbit (ISCO) frequency, the unstable photon-orbit impact\nparameter (shadow radius), the entire orbital angular speed profile for\ncircular Kepler observers and the entire lensing deflection angle curve for\nvarious types of compact objects, including non-singular and singular black\nholes, boson stars and naked singularities, from various theories of gravity.\nFinally, we provide in a tabular form the first 11 coefficients of the\nfourth-order RZ parameterization needed to describe a variety of commonly used\nblack-hole spacetimes. When comparing with the first-order RZ parameterization\nof astrophysical observables such as the ISCO frequency, the coefficients\nprovided here increase the accuracy of two orders of magnitude or more.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 16:59:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

On the other\nhand, there is a large semantic gap between seen and unseen classes in the\nexisting multi-label classification datasets. To address these difficult\nissues, this paper introduces a novel multi-label zero-shot classification\nframework by learning to transfer from external knowledge. We observe that\nImageNet is commonly used to pretrain the feature extractor and has a large and\nfine-grained label space. This motivates us to exploit it as external knowledge\nto bridge the seen and unseen classes and promote generalization. Specifically,\nwe construct a knowledge graph including not only classes from the target\ndataset but also those from ImageNet. Since ImageNet labels are not available\nin the target dataset, we propose a novel PosVAE module to infer their initial\nstates in the extended knowledge graph.

Due\nto its improved bit-flipping criterion, Thresholded SCF (TSCF) decoding\nalgorithm exhibits a superior error-correction performance and lower\ncomputational complexity than SCF decoding. However, the parameters of TSCF\ndecoding depend on multiple channel and code parameters, and are obtained via\nMonte-Carlo simulations. Our main goal is to realize TSCF decoding as a\npractical polar decoder implementation. To this end, we first realize an\napproximated threshold value that is independent of the code parameters and\nprecomputations.

In this paper, we present two synthesizers, one optimal and one\napproximate but nearly optimal. Although a few optimal approaches to this\nproblem have been published, our optimal synthesizer explores a larger solution\nspace, thus is optimal in a stronger sense. In addition, it reduces time and\nspace complexity exponentially compared to some leading optimal approaches. The\nkey to this success is a more efficient spacetime-based variable encoding of\nthe layout synthesis problem as a mathematical programming problem.

Therefore, this work intends to present an application of\ndeep learning techniques to identify patterns in Brazilian pre-salt carbonate\nrock microtomographic images, thus making possible lithological classification.\nFour convolutional neural network models were proposed. The first model\nincludes three convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers and is\nused as a base model for the following proposals. In the next two models, we\nreplace the max pooling layer with a spatial pyramid pooling and a global\naverage pooling layer. The last model uses a combination of spatial pyramid\npooling followed by global average pooling in place of the last pooling layer.\nAll models are compared using original images, when possible, as well as\nresized images. The dataset consists of 6,000 images from three different\nclasses. The model performances were evaluated by each image individually, as\nwell as by the most frequently predicted class for each sample. According to\naccuracy, Model 2 trained on resized images achieved the best results, reaching\nan average of 75.54% for the first evaluation approach and an average of 81.33%\nfor the second. We developed a workflow to automate and accelerate the\nlithology classification of Brazilian pre-salt carbonate samples by\ncategorizing microtomographic images using deep learning algorithms in a\nnon-destructive way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 19:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}

We use the [13CII]\nline to measure the optical depth of the [CII] emission, and find that the\n[CII] line profiles are influenced by self-absorption, while the [13CII] line\nremains unaffected by these effects. Hence, for dense PDRs, [13CII] emission is\na better tracer of gas kinematics. The optical depth of the [CII] line is up to\n10 in S235A. We find an expanding motion of the [CII]-emitting layer of the\nPDRs into the front molecular layer in both regions. Comparison of the gas and\ndust columns shows that gas components visible neither in the [CII] nor in\nlow-J CO lines may contribute to the total column across S235A. We test whether\nthe observed properties of the PDRs match the predictions of spherical models\nof expanding HII region + PDR + molecular cloud. Integrated intensities of the\n[13CII], [CII] and [OI] lines are well-represented by the model, but the models\ndo not reproduce the double-peaked [CII] line profiles due to an insufficient\ncolumn density of C+. The model predicts that the [OI] line could be a more\nreliable tracer of gas kinematics, but the foreground self-absorbing material\ndoes not allow using it in the considered regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 19:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}

For the numerical solution of the coupled model, partitioned\nschemes, that foresee the sequential solution of the two subproblems, are often\nused. However, this approach may be unstable. For this reason, the coupled\nmodel is commonly solved as a unique system using Newton type algorithms, at\nthe price, however, of high computational costs. In light of this motivation,\nin this paper we propose a new numerical scheme, that is numerically stable and\naccurate, yet within a fully partitioned (i.e. segregated) framework.\nSpecifically, we introduce, with respect to standard segregated scheme, a\nnumerically consistent stabilization term, capable of removing the nonphysical\noscillations otherwise present in the numerical solution of the commonly used\nsegregated scheme. Our new method is derived moving from a physics-based\nanalysis on the microscale energetics of the force generation dynamics. By\nconsidering a model problem of active mechanics we prove that the proposed\nscheme is unconditionally absolutely stable (i.e. it is stable for any time\nstep size), unlike the standard segregated scheme, and we also provide an\ninterpretation of the scheme as a fractional step method. We show, by means of\nseveral numerical tests, that the proposed stabilization term successfully\nremoves the nonphysical numerical oscillations characterizing the non\nstabilized segregated scheme solution.

The dynamics of probability distributions is\ndriven by the maximization of an entropy subject to constraints that carry the\nrelevant physical information -- directionality, correlations, gauge\ninteractions, etc. The challenge is to identify those constraints and to\nestablish a criterion for how the constraints themselves are updated. In this\npaper the ED framework is extended to describe a spin-1/2 point particle. In ED\nspin is neither modelled as a rotating body, nor through the motion of a point\nparticle; it is an epistemic property of the wave function. The constraint that\nreflects the peculiar rotational properties of spin is most effectively\nexpressed in the language of geometric algebra. The updating of all constraints\nis carried out in a way that stresses the central importance of symmetry\nprinciples. First we identify the appropriate symplectic and metric structures\nin the phase space of probabilities, their conjugate momenta, and the spin\nvariables. This construction yields a derivation of the Fubini-Study metric for\na spin-1/2 particle which highlights its deep connection to information\ngeometry. Then we construct an ED that preserves both the symplectic structure\n(a Hamiltonian flow) and the metric structure (a Killing flow). We show that\ngeneric Hamiltonian-Killing flows are linear in the wave function. Imposing\nfurther that the Hamiltonian be the generator of an entropic evolution in time\nleads to an entropic dynamics described by the Pauli equation. We conclude with\na discussion of the new interpretation of the formalism which yields a physical\npicture that is significantly different from that provided by other\ninterpretations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 20:02:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 11:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

To plan against such an adaptive opponent, the\nagent must leverage its knowledge about the adversary's incomplete information\nto influence the behavior of the opponent, and thereby being deceptive. To\nsynthesize a deceptive strategy, we introduce a class of hypergame models that\ncapture the interaction between the agent and its adversary given asymmetric,\nincomplete information. A hypergame is a hierarchy of games, perceived\ndifferently by the agent and its adversary. We develop the solution concept of\nthis class of hypergames and show that the subjectively rationalizable strategy\nfor the agent is deceptive and maximizes the probability of satisfying the task\nin temporal logic. This deceptive strategy is obtained by modeling the opponent\nevolving perception of the interaction and integrating the opponent model into\nproactive planning. Following the deceptive strategy, the agent chooses actions\nto influence the game history as well as to manipulate the adversary's\nperception so that it takes actions that benefit the goal of the agent. We\ndemonstrate the correctness of our deceptive planning algorithm using robot\nmotion planning examples with temporal logic objectives and design a detection\nmechanism to notify the agent of potential errors in modeling of the\nadversary's behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 20:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}

We experimentally optimise the pitch\nangle kinematics of a flapping wing system in hover to maximise the stroke\naverage lift and hovering efficiency using a evolutionary algorithm and in-situ\nforce and torque measurements at the wing root. Additional flow field\nmeasurements are conducted to link the vortical flow structures to the\naerodynamic performance for the Pareto-optimal kinematics. The optimised pitch\nangle profiles yielding maximum stroke-average lift coefficients have\ntrapezoidal shapes and high average angles of attack.

The recent discovery of time-correlated optical and gamma-ray\nemission in classical novae has revealed the important role of radiative shocks\nin powering these events, enabling an unprecedented view of the properties of\nion acceleration, including its efficiency and energy spectrum, under similar\nphysical conditions to shocks in extragalactic transients. Here we introduce a\nmodel for connecting the radiated optical fluence of non-relativistic\ntransients to their maximal neutrino and gamma-ray fluence. We apply this\ntechnique to a wide range of extragalactic transient classes in order to place\nlimits on their contributions to the cosmological high-energy gamma-ray and\nneutrino backgrounds. Based on a simple model for diffusive shock acceleration\nat radiative shocks, calibrated to novae, we demonstrate that several of the\nmost luminous transients can accelerate protons up to energies $E_{\\rm max}\n\\gtrsim 10^{16}$ eV, sufficient to contribute to the IceCube astrophysical\nbackground. Furthermore, several of the considered sources$-$particularly\nhydrogen-poor supernovae$-$may serve as \"hidden\" gamma-ray sources due to the\nhigh gamma-ray opacity of their ejecta, evading constraints imposed by the\nnon-blazar Fermi-LAT background. However, adopting an ion acceleration\nefficiency $\\sim$ 0.3-1$\\%$ motivated by nova observations, we find that\ncurrently known classes of non-relativistic, potentially shock-powered\ntransients contribute at most a few percent of the total IceCube background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 21:07:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 21:16:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2021 18:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

Our goal is to blend a performant and a safe\ncontroller to generate a single controller that is safer than the performant\nand accumulates higher rewards than the safe controller. To this end, we\npropose a blending algorithm using the framework of contextual multi-armed\nmulti-objective bandits.

For a regression\nfunction, the I-prior is Gaussian with covariance kernel proportional to the\nFisher information on the regression function, which is estimated by its\nposterior distribution under the I-prior. The I-prior has the intuitively\nappealing property that the more information is available on a linear\nfunctional of the regression function, the larger the prior variance, and the\nsmaller the influence of the prior mean on the posterior distribution.\n  Advantages compared to competing methods, such as Gaussian process regression\nor Tikhonov regularization, are ease of estimation and model comparison.

The Fermi level\nvariation with orientation of MA is proposed to be responsible for the\nexperimentally observed intrinsic open-circuit voltage V_OC, ambipolarity, and\nlong lifetime of the excitons.

We then extend this\nresult to the non-asymptotic setting, proving that one can achieve any desired\napproximation error with high probability provided $n$ is sufficiently large.\nWe further adapt this randomized neural network architecture to approximate\nfunctions on smooth, compact submanifolds of Euclidean space, providing\ntheoretical guarantees in both the asymptotic and non-asymptotic forms.\nFinally, we illustrate our results on manifolds with numerical experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 23:50:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 14:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

Federated learning is a popular approach for\nprivacy protection that collects the local gradient information instead of real\ndata. One way to achieve a strict privacy guarantee is to apply local\ndifferential privacy into federated learning. However, previous works do not\ngive a practical solution due to three issues. First, the noisy data is close\nto its original value with high probability, increasing the risk of information\nexposure. Second, a large variance is introduced to the estimated average,\ncausing poor accuracy. Last, the privacy budget explodes due to the high\ndimensionality of weights in deep learning models. In this paper, we proposed a\nnovel design of local differential privacy mechanism for federated learning to\naddress the abovementioned issues.

To enable app-specific\nresponse generation, this work proposes AARSynth: an app-aware response\nsynthesis system. The key idea behind AARSynth is to augment the seq2seq model\nwith information specific to a given app. Given a new user review, it first\nretrieves the top-K most relevant app reviews and the most relevant snippet\nfrom the app description. The retrieved information and the new user review are\nthen fed into a fused machine learning model that integrates the seq2seq model\nwith a machine reading comprehension model. The latter helps digest the\nretrieved reviews and app description. Finally, the fused model generates a\nresponse that is customized to the given app. We evaluated AARSynth using a\nlarge corpus of reviews and responses from Google Play. The results show that\nAARSynth outperforms the state-of-the-art system by 22.2% on BLEU-4 score.\nFurthermore, our human study shows that AARSynth produces a statistically\nsignificant improvement in response quality compared to the state-of-the-art\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 01:28:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 06:49:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 19:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

In solid\nstate systems with dopants, an electric field was shown to effectively change\nthe spacing between the nuclear spin qubit levels when the electron spin\ndensity is high at the nucleus of the dopant. Inspired by such solid-state\nsystems, we propose that divalent lanthanide (Ln) complexes with an unusual\nelectronic configuration of Ln$^{2+}$ have a strong interaction between the Ln\nnuclear spin and the electronic degrees of freedom, which renders electrical\ntuning of the interaction.

The core idea we propose builds on recent approaches splitting DNNs into\nsections - namely head and tail models - executed by the mobile device and edge\nserver, respectively. The wireless link, then, is used to transport the output\nof the last layer of the head model to the edge server, instead of the DNN\ninput.

Based on results, as the distance between private and public\nclouds increases, the throughput performance of most databases reduces. Second,\nMongoDB obtains the best throughput performance, followed by MySQL C luster,\nwhilst Cassandra exposes the most fluctuation in through performance. Third,\nvertical scalability improves the throughput of databases more than the\nhorizontal scalability. Forth, exploiting bigger VMs rather than more VMs with\nless cores can increase throughput performance for Cassandra, Riak, and Redis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 03:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}

As such, recent works on\nvisual domain adaptation which leverage adversarial learning to unify the\nsource and target video representations and strengthen the feature\ntransferability are not highly effective on the videos. To overcome this\nlimitation, in this paper, we learn a domain-agnostic video classifier instead\nof learning domain-invariant representations, and propose an Adversarial\nBipartite Graph (ABG) learning framework which directly models the\nsource-target interactions with a network topology of the bipartite graph.\nSpecifically, the source and target frames are sampled as heterogeneous\nvertexes while the edges connecting two types of nodes measure the affinity\namong them. Through message-passing, each vertex aggregates the features from\nits heterogeneous neighbors, forcing the features coming from the same class to\nbe mixed evenly. Explicitly exposing the video classifier to such cross-domain\nrepresentations at the training and test stages makes our model less biased to\nthe labeled source data, which in-turn results in achieving a better\ngeneralization on the target domain. To further enhance the model capacity and\ntestify the robustness of the proposed architecture on difficult transfer\ntasks, we extend our model to work in a semi-supervised setting using an\nadditional video-level bipartite graph.

In scientific\ndomains, the scientist often wishes to discover which features are actually\nimportant for making the predictions. These discoveries may lead to costly\nfollow-up experiments and as such it is important that the error rate on\ndiscoveries is not too high. Model-X knockoffs enable important features to be\ndiscovered with control of the FDR. However, knockoffs require rich generative\nmodels capable of accurately modeling the knockoff features while ensuring they\nobey the so-called \"swap\" property. We develop Deep Direct Likelihood Knockoffs\n(DDLK), which directly minimizes the KL divergence implied by the knockoff swap\nproperty. DDLK consists of two stages: it first maximizes the explicit\nlikelihood of the features, then minimizes the KL divergence between the joint\ndistribution of features and knockoffs and any swap between them. To ensure\nthat the generated knockoffs are valid under any possible swap, DDLK uses the\nGumbel-Softmax trick to optimize the knockoff generator under the worst-case\nswap. We find DDLK has higher power than baselines while controlling the false\ndiscovery rate on a variety of synthetic and real benchmarks including a task\ninvolving a large dataset from one of the epicenters of COVID-19.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 04:09:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}

In particular, an important motivating application arises from the\nnotion of efficiency estimation of equilibria in multi-agent networks, e.g.,\ncommunication networks and power systems. In the literature, the iteration\ncomplexity of the existing solution methods for optimization problems with CVI\nconstraints appears to be unknown.

Using extensive Monte Carlo simulation-based experiments,\nimplementations on a single board compute module, and field experiments using\nan aerial robot platform with multiple VHF radio collar tags, we evaluate our\njoint planning and tracking algorithms. Further, we compare our method with\nother information-based planning methods with and without situational awareness\nto demonstrate the effectiveness of our robot executing LAVAPilot. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that LAVAPilot significantly reduces (by 98.5%) the\ncomputational cost of planning to enable real-time planning decisions whilst\nachieving similar localization accuracy of objects compared to information gain\nbased planning methods, albeit taking a slightly longer time to complete a\nmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 06:09:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

The Deep Learning regime empowers\nclassifiers to extract distinct patterns (or features) of a given class from\ntraining data, which is the basis on which they generalize to unseen data.\nBefore deploying these models on critical applications, it is advantageous to\nvisualize the features considered to be essential for classification.

In this work, we propose a\nsaliency-driven approach to visualize discriminative features that are\nconsidered most important for a given task. Another drawback of existing\nmethods is that confidence of the generated visualizations is increased by\ncreating multiple instances of the given class. We restrict the algorithm to\ndevelop a single object per image, which helps further in extracting features\nof high confidence and also results in better visualizations. We further\ndemonstrate the generation of negative images as naturally fused images of two\nor more classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 06:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}

The second contribution of our work is\nto incorporate the extracted information into the nonlinear constraints of NMPC\nfor avoiding collisions. Our third contribution focuses on making the\ncontroller robust by considering the uncertainty of localization and NMPC using\nthe Shannon entropy. This step enables us to track either the position or\nvelocity references, or none of them if necessary. As a result, the collision\navoidance constraints are defined in the local coordinates of MAVs and it\nremains active and guarantees collision avoidance, despite localization\nuncertainties, e.g., position estimation drifts. Additionally, as the platform\ncontinues the mission, this will result in less uncertain position estimations,\ndue to the feature extraction and loop closure. The efficacy of the suggested\nframework has been evaluated using various simulations in the Gazebo\nenvironment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 07:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}

The mobility\ncoefficient is adjusted adaptively as a function of gradients of the velocity\nand the order parameter in the diffuse interface region in such a way that the\nfree energy minimization properly opposes the convective distortion. The ratio\nof the convective distortion to the free energy minimization is termed as the\nconvective distortion parameter, which characterizes the deviation from the\nhyperbolic tangent shape due to the convection effect.

Therefore applications often require an\nup-to-the-minute characterisation of the fragile TM, typically entailing\nhundreds to thousands of probe measurements.

However, in the\nmedical field, there are cases that all the images should share the same weight\nmap because the set of images record the same kind of symptom related to the\nsame object and thereby share the same structural content. In this paper, we\nthus propose a novel global spatial attention mechanism in CNNs mainly for\nmedical image classification. The global weight map is instantiated by a\ndecision boundary between important pixels and unimportant pixels. And we\npropose to realize the decision boundary by a binary classifier in which the\nintensities of all images at a pixel are the features of the pixel. The binary\nclassification is integrated into an image classification CNN and is to be\noptimized together with the CNN. Experiments on two medical image datasets and\none facial expression dataset showed that with the proposed attention, not only\nthe performance of four powerful CNNs which are GoogleNet, VGG, ResNet, and\nDenseNet can be improved, but also meaningful attended regions can be obtained,\nwhich is beneficial for understanding the content of images of a domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 08:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}

A client delegates a measurement\ntask to a remote server that has a quantum sensor, and eavesdropper (Eve)\nsteals every classical information stored in the server side. By using quantum\nproperties, the QRS provides an asymmetricity about the information gain where\nthe client gets more information about the sensing results than Eve. However,\nquantum states are fragile against decoherence, and so it is not clear whether\nsuch a QRS is practically useful under the effect of realistic noise. Here, we\ninvestigate the performance of the QRS with dephasing during the interaction\nwith the target fields. In the QRS, the client and server need to share a Bell\npair, and an imperfection of the Bell pair leads to a state preparation error\nin a systematic way on the server side for the sensing.

We call this type of visualization scalable scatterplot\nvisualizations, or SSV for short. Despite the potential of SSVs, existing\nsystems and toolkits fall short in supporting the authoring of SSVs due to\nthree limitations. First, many systems have limited scalability, assuming that\ndata fits in the memory of one computer. Second, too much developer work, e.g.,\nusing custom code to generate mark layouts or render objects, is required.\nThird, many systems focus on only a small subset of the SSV design space (e.g.\nsupporting a specific type of visual marks). To address these limitations, we\nhave developed Kyrix-S, a system for easy authoring of SSVs at scale. Kyrix-S\nderives a declarative grammar that enables specification of a variety of SSVs\nin a few tens of lines of code, based on an existing survey of scatterplot\ntasks and designs. The declarative grammar is supported by a distributed layout\nalgorithm which automatically places visual marks onto zoom levels.

In this paper, we start\nexploring this issue by analyzing a Suzaku observation of the stellar-mass\nblack hole in GRS 1915+105 and simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations\nof the supermassive black hole in MCG-6-30-15. The relativistic reflection\ncomponent of these sources is fitted with RELCONV$\\times$REFLIONX,\nRELCONV$\\times$XILLVER, and RELXILL. We discuss the differences and the impact\non the study of accreting black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 09:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-28"}

As a consequence, the transition location\nwas substantially delayed in the downstream direction by 55% with respect to\nthe uncontrolled reference case.

Penumbral microjets are elongated jet-like brightenings observed in\nthe chromosphere above sunspot penumbrae. They are transient events that last\nfrom a few seconds to several minutes and are thought to originate from\nmagnetic reconnection processes. Previous studies have mainly focused on their\nmorphological and spectral characteristics, and more recently on their\nspectropolarimetric signals during the maximum brightness stage. Studies\naddressing the temporal evolution of PMJs have also been carried out, but they\nare based on spatial and spectral time variations only.\n  Aims. Here we investigate the temporal evolution of the polarization signals\nproduced by short-lived PMJs (lifetimes $<$ 2 minutes) to infer how the\nmagnetic field vector evolves in the upper photosphere and mid-chromosphere.\n  Methods. We use fast-cadence spectropolarimetric observations of the Ca II\n854.2 nm line taken with the CRisp Imaging Spectropolarimeter at the Swedish\n1-m Solar Telescope. The weak-field approximation (WFA) is used to estimate the\nstrength and inclination of the magnetic field vector.\n  Results. The WFA reveals larger magnetic field changes in the upper\nphotosphere than in the chromosphere during the PMJ maximum brightness stage.\nIn the photosphere, the magnetic field inclination and strength undergo a\ntransient increase for most PMJs, but in 25$\\%$ of the cases the field strength\ndecreases during the brightening. In the chromosphere, the magnetic field tends\nto be slightly stronger during the PMJs.\n  Conclusions. The propagation of compressive perturbation fronts followed by a\nrarefaction phase in the aftershock region may explain the observed behavior of\nthe magnetic field vector. The fact that such behavior varies among the\nanalyzed PMJs could be a consequence of the limited temporal resolution of the\nobservations and the fast-evolving nature of the PMJs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 09:39:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

However, directly applying grey-box fuzzing to\ninput-dependent multithreaded programs can be extremely inefficient. In\npractice, multithreading-relevant bugs are usually buried in sophisticated\nprogram flows. Meanwhile, the existing grey-box fuzzing techniques do not\nstress thread-interleavings which affect execution states in multithreaded\nprograms. Therefore, mainstream grey-box fuzzers cannot effectively test\nproblematic segments in multithreaded programs despite they might obtain high\ncode coverage statistics.\n  To this end, we propose MUZZ, a new grey-box fuzzing technique that hunts for\nbugs in multithreaded programs. MUZZ owns three novel thread-aware\ninstrumentations, namely coverage-oriented instrumentation, thread-context\ninstrumentation, and schedule-intervention instrumentation. During fuzzing,\nthese instrumentations engender runtime feedback to stress execution states\ncaused by thread interleavings. By leveraging the feedback in the dynamic seed\nselection and execution strategies, MUZZ preserves more valuable seeds that\nexpose bugs in a multithreading context.\n  We evaluate MUZZ on 12 real-world software programs. Experiments show that\nMUZZ outperforms AFL in both multithreading-relevant seed generation and\nconcurrency-vulnerability detection. Further, by replaying the target programs\nagainst the generated seeds, MUZZ also reveals more concurrency-bugs (e.g.,\ndata-races, thread-leaks) than AFL. In total, MUZZ detected 8 new\nconcurrency-vulnerabilities and 19 new concurrency-bugs.

In addition, we provide Ks photometry of about 3,000 stars in a very\ndeep central field of 10\"x10\", centred on Sgr A*. We find that the Ks\nluminosity function (KLF) is rather homogeneous within the studied field and\ndoes not show any significant changes as a function of distance from the\ncentral black hole on scales of a few 0.1 pc. By fitting theoretical luminosity\nfunctions to the KLF, we derive the star formation history of the nuclear star\ncluster. We find that about 80% of the original star formation took place 10\nGyr ago or longer, followed by a largely quiescent phase that lasted for more\nthan 5 Gyr. We clearly detect the presence of intermediate-age stars of about 3\nGyr in age. This event makes up about 15% of the originally formed stellar mass\nof the cluster. A few percent of the stellar mass formed in the past few 100\nMyr. Our results appear to be inconsistent with a quasi-continuous star\nformation history. The stellar density increases exponentially towards Sgr A*\nat all magnitudes between Ks=15 to 19. We also show that the precise properties\nof the stellar cusp around Sgr A* are hard to determine because the star\nformation history suggests that the star counts can be significantly\ncontaminated, at all magnitudes, by stars that are too young to be dynamically\nrelaxed. We find that the probability of observing any young (non-millisecond)\npulsar in a tight orbit around Sgr A* and beamed towards Earth is very low. We\nargue that typical globular clusters, such as they are observed in and around\nthe Milky Way today, have probably not contributed to the nuclear cluster's\nmass in any significant way. The nuclear cluster may have formed following\nmajor merger events in the early history of the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 10:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

However, the predictive performance of these algorithms\ndepends on the quality of labels. This problem is particularly pertinent in the\nmedical image domain, where both the annotation cost and inter-observer\nvariability are high. In a typical label acquisition process, different human\nexperts provide their estimates of the \"true\" segmentation labels under the\ninfluence of their own biases and competence levels. Treating these noisy\nlabels blindly as the ground truth limits the performance that automatic\nsegmentation algorithms can achieve. In this work, we present a method for\njointly learning, from purely noisy observations alone, the reliability of\nindividual annotators and the true segmentation label distributions, using two\ncoupled CNNs. The separation of the two is achieved by encouraging the\nestimated annotators to be maximally unreliable while achieving high fidelity\nwith the noisy training data.

Depletion of\nozone, the most notable of these changes, is extremely dangerous to living\norganisms as any decrease in ozone levels leads to an increase in the\nirradiance of harmful solar radiation at the Earth's surface. In this work we\nconsider dark matter as an astrophysical source of gamma rays, by the\nannihilation and decay of WIMPs found within dark compact halo objects known as\nUltraCompact Minihaloes (UCMHs). We calculate the fluence of gamma rays\nproduced in this way and simulate the resulting changes to terrestrial ozone\nlevels using the Goddard Space Flight Center 2D Atmospheric Model.

The associated constraints and symmetries can affect\ncollective-motion patterns, but little is known about pattern stability in the\npresence of surface curvature. To make progress, we construct a general model\nfor self-propelled swarms moving on surfaces using Lagrangian mechanics. We\nfind that the combination of self-propulsion, friction, mutual attraction, and\nsurface curvature produce milling patterns where each agent in a swarm\noscillates on a limit cycle, with different agents splayed along the cycle such\nthat the swarm's center-of-mass remains stationary. In general, such patterns\nloose stability when mutual attraction is insufficient to overcome the\nconstraint of curvature, and we uncover two broad classes of stationary\nmilling-state bifurcations. In the first, a spatially periodic mode undergoes a\nHopf bifurcation as curvature is increased which results in unstable\nspatiotemporal oscillations. This generic bifurcation is analyzed for the\nsphere and demonstrated numerically for several surfaces. In the second, a\nsaddle-node-of-periodic-orbits occurs in which stable and unstable milling\nstates collide and annihilate. The latter is analyzed for milling states on\ncylindrical surfaces. Our results contribute to the general understanding of\nswarm pattern-formation and stability in the presence of surface curvature, and\nmay aid in designing robotic swarms that can be controlled to move over complex\nsurfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 11:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

We investigate the linear\nstability properties of these systems in considerable generality. Naive\nformulations of the morphodynamics, featuring exchange of sediment between a\nwell-mixed suspended load and the bed, lead to mathematically ill-posed\ngoverning equations. This is traced to a singularity in the linearised system\nat Froude number $Fr = 1$ that causes unbounded unstable growth of\nshort-wavelength disturbances. The inclusion of neglected physical processes\ncan restore well posedness. Turbulent momentum diffusion (eddy viscosity) and a\nsuitably parametrised bed load sediment transport are shown separately to be\nsufficient in this regard. However, we demonstrate that such models typically\ninherit an associated instability that is absent from non-morphodynamic\nsettings. Implications of our analyses are considered for simple generic\nclosures, including a drag law that switches between fluid and granular\nbehaviour, depending on the sediment concentration. Steady morphodynamic flows\nbifurcate into two states: dilute flows, which are stable at low $Fr$, and\nconcentrated flows which are always unstable to disturbances in concentration.\nBy computing the growth rates of linear modes across a wide region of parameter\nspace, we examine in detail the effects of specific model parameters including\nthe choices of sediment erodibility, eddy viscosity and bed load flux.

The static linear permittivity of polar fluids\n$\\epsilon$ is calculated as a function of temperature, density and molecular\ndipole moment in vacuo for arbitrary pair interaction potentials. Then, using\nthe Kirkwood superposition approximation for the three-body orientational\ndistribution function, we suggest a simple way to construct model potentials of\nmean torques considering permanent and induced dipole moments. We successfully\ncompare the theory with the experimental temperature dependence of the static\nlinear permittivity of various polar fluids such as a series of linear\nmonohydroxy alcohols, water, tributyl phosphate, acetonitrile, acetone,\nnitrobenzene and dimethyl sulfoxide, by fitting only one single parameter,\nwhich describes the induction to dipole-dipole energy strength ratio.

In this light, the failure of the theory to\ndescribe the experimental temperature dependence of the static dielectric\nconstant of glycerol, a non-rigid polyalcohol, is not due to the lack of\nspecific H-bonding mechanisms, but rather to an oversimplified model potential\nfor that particular molecule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 12:38:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 10:46:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

This allows the energy density carried by the Galileon scalar to be\nsufficiently small that it evades stringent constraints from the integrated\nSachs-Wolfe effect, which otherwise rules out the cubic Galileon theory.\nAlthough the model with disformal coupling does not exhibit screening, we show\nthere is a `screening-like' phenomenon in which the energy density carried by\nthe Galileon scalar is suppressed during matter domination when the quadratic\nand cubic Galileon operators are both relevant and the quadratic sector has a\nstable kinetic term. We obtain the explicit 3+1 form of Maxwell's equations in\nthe presence of the disformal coupling, and the wave equations that govern\nelectromagnetic waves. The disformal coupling is known to generate a small mass\nthat modifies their velocity of propagation. We use the WKB approximation to\nstudy electromagnetic waves in this theory and show that, despite remarkable\nrecent constraints from the LIGO/Virgo observatories that restrict the\ndifference in propagation velocity between electromagnetic and gravitational\nradiation to roughly 1 part in $10^{15}$, the disformal coupling is too weak to\nbe constrained by events such as GW170817 or by the dispersion of\nelectromagnetic radiation at different wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 17:29:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 14:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

However, existing\nmethods do not learn representations that can be interpreted in a\nstraightforward way and that are robust to perturbations to the graph\nstructure. In this work, we address these two limitations by proposing\nnode2coords, a representation learning algorithm for graphs, which learns\nsimultaneously a low-dimensional space and coordinates for the nodes in that\nspace. The patterns that span the low dimensional space reveal the graph's most\nimportant structural information. The coordinates of the nodes reveal the\nproximity of their local structure to the graph structural patterns. In order\nto measure this proximity by taking into account the underlying graph, we\npropose to use Wasserstein distances. We introduce an autoencoder that employs\na linear layer in the encoder and a novel Wasserstein barycentric layer at the\ndecoder. Node connectivity descriptors, that capture the local structure of the\nnodes, are passed through the encoder to learn the small set of graph\nstructural patterns. In the decoder, the node connectivity descriptors are\nreconstructed as Wasserstein barycenters of the graph structural patterns. The\noptimal weights for the barycenter representation of a node's connectivity\ndescriptor correspond to the coordinates of that node in the low-dimensional\nspace. Experimental results demonstrate that the representations learned with\nnode2coords are interpretable, lead to node embeddings that are stable to\nperturbations of the graph structure and achieve competitive or superior\nresults compared to state-of-the-art methods in node classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 13:14:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2021 18:17:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

However, we demonstrate that the results are\nstrongly affected by: i) the relative weight between gNB installation costs and\n5G service coverage level, ii) the scaling parameters to estimate the exposure\ngenerated by 5G gNBs, iii) the amount of exposure from pre-5G technologies and\niv) the adopted frequency reuse scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 13:41:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 13:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

To solve this problem, we have developed RAMOSE, a\ngeneric tool developed in Python to create REST APIs over SPARQL endpoints.\nThrough the creation of source-specific textual configuration files, RAMOSE\nenables the querying of SPARQL endpoints via simple Web RESTful API calls that\nreturn either JSON or CSV-formatted data, thus hiding all the intrinsic\ncomplexities of SPARQL and RDF from common Web users. We provide evidence that\nthe use of RAMOSE to provide REST API access to RDF data within OpenCitations\ntriplestores is beneficial in terms of the number of queries made by external\nusers to such RDF data using the RAMOSE API compared with the direct access via\nthe SPARQL endpoint.

The approach presented\nhere introduces a variational class of wavefunctions based on complex networks\nof classical spins akin to artificial neural networks, which can be constructed\nin a controlled fashion.

It will house a neutrino telescope comprising hundreds of networked\nmoorings - detection units or strings equipped with optical instrumentation to\ndetect the Cherenkov radiation generated by charged particles from\nneutrino-induced collisions in its vicinity. In comparison to moorings\ntypically used for oceanography, several key features of the KM3NeT string are\ndifferent: the instrumentation is contained in transparent and thus unprotected\nglass spheres; two thin Dyneema ropes are used as strength members; and a thin\ndelicate backbone tube with fibre-optics and copper wires for data and power\ntransmission, respectively, runs along the full length of the mooring. Also,\ncompared to other neutrino telescopes such as ANTARES in the Mediterranean Sea\nand GVD in Lake Baikal, the KM3NeT strings are more slender to minimise the\namount of material used for support of the optical sensors. Moreover, the rate\nof deploying a large number of strings in a period of a few years is\nunprecedented. For all these reasons, for the installation of the KM3NeT\nstrings, a custom-made, fast deployment method was designed.

Supervised learning paradigms are often limited by the amount of\nlabeled data that is available. This phenomenon is particularly problematic in\nclinically-relevant data, such as electroencephalography (EEG), where labeling\ncan be costly in terms of specialized expertise and human processing time.\nConsequently, deep learning architectures designed to learn on EEG data have\nyielded relatively shallow models and performances at best similar to those of\ntraditional feature-based approaches.

By extracting information from this unlabeled\ndata, it might be possible to reach competitive performance with deep neural\nnetworks despite limited access to labels. Approach. We investigated\nself-supervised learning (SSL), a promising technique for discovering structure\nin unlabeled data, to learn representations of EEG signals.

Such reweighting has been shown for monaural vs. binaural cues.\nHowever, studies attempting to reweight the two binaural cues, interaural\ndifferences in time and level, yielded inconclusive results. In this study we\ninvestigated whether binaural cue reweighting can be induced by a\nlateralization training in a virtual audio-visual environment. 20\nnormal-hearing participants, divided into two groups, completed the experiment\nconsisting of a seven-day lateralization training in a virtual audio-visual\nenvironment, preceded and followed by a test measuring the binaural cue\nweights. During testing, the participants task was to lateralize 500-ms\nbandpass-filtered (2-4 kHz) noise bursts containing various combinations of\nspatially consistent and inconsistent ITDs and ILDs. During training, the task\nwas extended by visual cues reinforcing ITDs in one group and ILDs in the other\ngroup as well as manipulating the azimuthal ranges of the two cues. In both\ngroups, the weight given to the reinforced cue increased significantly from\npre- to posttest, suggesting that participants reweighted the binaural cues in\nthe expected direction. This reweighting occurred predominantly within the\nfirst training session. The present results are relevant as binaural cue\nreweighting is, for example, likely to occur when normal-hearing listeners\nadapt to new acoustic environments. Similarly, binaural cue reweighting might\nbe a factor underlying the low contribution of ITDs to sound localization of\ncochlear-implant listeners as they typically do not experience reliable ITD\ncues with their clinical devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 15:05:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-10"}

This is due to CTA's unprecedented sensitivity,\nangular and energy resolutions, and the planned observational strategy.

The strongly debated\nfree radical theory of ageing even states that damage caused by free radicals\nis the main cause of aging on a cellular level.

We make use of\nnitrogen vacancy centers in nanodiamonds. Via a quantum effect these defects\nconvert a magnetic resonance signal into an optical signal. While this method\nis increasingly popular for its unprecedented sensitivity in physics, we use\nthis technique here for the first time to measure free radicals in living\ncells. Our signals are equivalent to T1 signals in conventional MRI but from\nnanoscale voxels from single cells with sub-cellular resolution.

A conventional setup for notoriously difficult\nqueueing network control problems is a Markov decision problem (MDP) that has\nthree features: infinite state space, unbounded costs, and long-run average\ncost objective. We extend the theoretical framework of these APG methods for\nsuch MDP problems. The resulting PPO algorithm is tested on a parallel-server\nsystem and large-size multiclass queueing networks. The algorithm consistently\ngenerates control policies that outperform state-of-art heuristics in\nliterature in a variety of load conditions from light to heavy traffic. These\npolicies are demonstrated to be near-optimal when the optimal policy can be\ncomputed.\n  A key to the successes of our PPO algorithm is the use of three variance\nreduction techniques in estimating the relative value function via sampling.\nFirst, we use a discounted relative value function as an approximation of the\nrelative value function. Second, we propose regenerative simulation to estimate\nthe discounted relative value function. Finally, we incorporate the\napproximating martingale-process method into the regenerative estimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 01:02:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2020 01:32:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 15:50:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:36:27 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 21:38:21 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 21:42:53 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 22:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

However, traditional language models only predict\nnext single word with given history, while the consecutive predictions on a\nsequence of words are usually demanded and useful in LVCSR. The mismatch\nbetween the single word prediction modeling in trained and the long term\nsequence prediction in read demands may lead to the performance degradation. In\nthis paper, a novel enhanced long short-term memory (LSTM) LM using the future\nvector is proposed. In addition to the given history, the rest of the sequence\nwill be also embedded by future vectors. This future vector can be incorporated\nwith the LSTM LM, so it has the ability to model much longer term sequence\nlevel information. Experiments show that, the proposed new LSTM LM gets a\nbetter result on BLEU scores for long term sequence prediction. For the speech\nrecognition rescoring, although the proposed LSTM LM obtains very slight gains,\nthe new model seems obtain the great complementary with the conventional LSTM\nLM. Rescoring using both the new and conventional LSTM LMs can achieve a very\nlarge improvement on the word error rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 08:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-06"}

ABSs can improve the\ncoverage and/or capacity of a network by moving supply towards demand.\nDeploying ABSs in a network presents several challenges such as finding an\nefficient 3D-placement of ABSs that takes network objectives into account.\nAnother challenge is the limited wireless backhaul capacity of ABSs and\nconsequently, potentially higher latency incurred. Content caching is proposed\nto alleviate the backhaul congestion and decrease the latency. We consider a\nlimited backhaul capacity for ABSs due to varying position-dependent path loss\nvalues and define two groups of users (delay-tolerant and delay-sensitive) with\ndifferent data rate requirements. We study the problem of jointly determining\nbackhaul-aware 3D placement for ABSs, user-BS associations and corresponding\nbandwidth allocations while minimizing total downlink transmit power. Proposed\niterative algorithm applies a decomposition method. First, the 3D locations of\nABSs are found using semi-definite relaxation and coordinate descent methods,\nand then user-BS associations and bandwidth allocations are optimized. The\nsimulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and\nprovide insights about the impact of traffic distribution and content caching\non transmit power and backhaul usage of ABSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 03:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}
