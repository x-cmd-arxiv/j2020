Reading a snapshotted value of an individual CAS object using this\nhandle is wait-free, taking time proportional to the number of successful CASes\non the object since the snapshot was taken. Our fast, flexible snapshots yield\nsimple, efficient implementations of atomic multi-point queries on concurrent\ndata structures built from CAS objects. For example, in a search tree where\nchild pointers are updated using CAS, once a snapshot is taken, one can\natomically search for ranges of keys, find the first key that matches some\ncriteria, or check if a collection of keys are all present, simply by running a\nstandard sequential algorithm on a snapshot of the tree.\n  To evaluate the performance of our approach, we apply it to two search trees,\none balanced and one not.

Without beam-splitters, some basic operations such as decoupling modes\nand swapping states between modes can become highly non-trivial or not feasible\nat all. In this work, we develop novel interference-based protocols for\ndecoupling and swapping selected modes of a multimode bosonic system without\nrequiring beam-splitters. Specifically, for a given generic coupler\ncharacterized by a Gaussian unitary process, we show how to decouple a single\nmode or swap any pair of modes with a constant depth sequence of operations,\nwhile maintaining the coupling for the remaining system. These protocols\nrequire only multiple uses of the given coupler, interleaved with single-mode\nGaussian unitary operations, and thus enable efficient construction of\noperations crucial to quantum information science, such as high-fidelity\nquantum transduction.

The main idea of\nthis work is to combine the Kadanoff's mean-field approach with the model\npresented by one of us previously. The mean-field approximation is introduced\nwith the replacement of the central spin in Ising Hamiltonian with an average\nvalue of particular spin configuration, i.e, the approximation is taken into\naccount within each configuration. This approximation is used in two different\nmean-field-type approaches. The first consideration is a pure-mean-field-type\ntreatment in which all the neighboring spins are replaced with the assumed\nconfigurational average. The second consideration is introduced by the reduced\ntransfer matrix method. The estimations of critical coupling values of the\nsystems are evaluated both numerically and also analytically by the using of\nsaddle point approximation. The analytical estimation of critical values in the\nfirst and second considerations are $ K_{c}=\\frac{1}{z} $ and $ (z-2)\nK_{c}e^{2K_{c}} =1 $ respectively. Obviously, both of the considerations have\nsome significant deviation from the exact treatment. In this work, we conclude\nthat the method introduced here is more appropriate physical picture than\nself-consistent mean-field-type models, because the method introduced here does\nnot presume the presence of the phase transition from the outset. Consequently,\nthe introduced approach potentially makes our research very valuable\nmean-field-type picture for phase transition treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 16:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13"}

Unfortunately, this assumption is\noften violated in practice. Due to synchronization issues, manual event\nrecordings, or data corruption, events are only partially ordered.

Prior work has focused on parameter\nuncertainty for selective planning. In this work, we emphasize the importance\nof model inadequacy. We show that heteroscedastic regression can signal\npredictive uncertainty arising from model inadequacy that is complementary to\nthat which is detected by methods designed for parameter uncertainty,\nindicating that considering both parameter uncertainty and model inadequacy may\nbe a more promising direction for effective selective planning than either in\nisolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 18:51:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 22:32:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2021 21:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

This paper presents an\ninnovative local contextual-relation consistent domain adaptation (CrCDA)\ntechnique that aims to achieve local-level consistencies during the\nglobal-level alignment. The idea is to take a closer look at region-wise\nfeature representations and align them for local-level consistencies.\nSpecifically, CrCDA learns and enforces the prototypical local\ncontextual-relations explicitly in the feature space of a labelled source\ndomain while transferring them to an unlabelled target domain via\nbackpropagation-based adversarial learning. An adaptive entropy max-min\nadversarial learning scheme is designed to optimally align these hundreds of\nlocal contextual-relations across domain without requiring discriminator or\nextra computation overhead.

Yet, machine learning has not been able so far to realize an operating\nwarning system for flaring storms and the scientific literature of the last\ndecade suggests that its performances in the prediction of intense solar flares\nare not optimal.\n  The main difficulties related to forecasting solar flaring storms are\nprobably two. First, most methods are conceived to provide probabilistic\npredictions and not to send binary yes/no indications on the consecutive\noccurrence of flares along an extended time range. Second, flaring storms are\ntypically characterized by the explosion of high energy events, which are\nseldom recorded in the databases of space missions; as a consequence,\nsupervised methods are trained on very imbalanced historical sets, which makes\nthem particularly ineffective for the forecasting of intense flares.\n  Yet, in this study we show that supervised machine learning could be utilized\nin a way to send timely warnings about the most violent and most unexpected\nflaring event of the last decade, and even to predict with some accuracy the\nenergy budget daily released by magnetic reconnection during the whole time\ncourse of the storm.

Typically a LiDAR can only provide sparse\npoint cloud owing to a limited number of scanning lines. By employing depth\ncompletion, a dense depth map can be generated by assigning each camera pixel a\ncorresponding depth value. However, the existing depth completion convolutional\nneural networks are very complex that requires high-end GPUs for processing,\nand thus they are not applicable to real-time autonomous driving. In this\npaper, a light-weight network is proposed for the task of LiDAR point cloud\ndepth completion. With an astonishing 96.2% reduction in the number of\nparameters, it still achieves comparable performance (9.3% better in MAE but\n3.9% worse in RMSE) to the state-of-the-art network. For real-time embedded\nplatforms, depthwise separable technique is applied to both convolution and\ndeconvolution operations and the number of parameters decreases further by a\nfactor of 7.3, with only a small percentage increase in RMSE and MAE\nperformance. Moreover, a system-on-chip architecture for depth completion is\ndeveloped on a PYNQ-based FPGA platform that achieves real-time processing for\nHDL-64E LiDAR at the speed 11.1 frame per second.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 20:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

Though many general-purpose\nalgorithms were developed for prediction, dealing with highly correlated genes\nin the prediction model is still not well addressed. High correlation among\ngenes introduces technical problems, such as multi-collinearity issues, leading\nto unreliable prediction models. Furthermore, when a causal gene (whose\nvariants have an actual biological effect on a phenotype) is highly correlated\nwith other genes, most algorithms select the feature gene from the correlated\ngroup in a purely data-driven manner. Since the correlation structure among\ngenes could change substantially when condition changes, the prediction model\nbased on not correctly selected feature genes is unreliable. Therefore, we aim\nto keep the causal biological signal in the prediction process and build a more\nrobust prediction model.\n  Method: We propose a grouping algorithm, which treats highly correlated genes\nas a group and uses their common pattern to represent the group's biological\nsignal in feature selection. Our novel grouping algorithm can be integrated\ninto existing prediction algorithms to enhance their prediction performance.\nOur proposed grouping method has two advantages. First, using the gene group's\ncommon patterns makes the prediction more robust and reliable under condition\nchange. Second, it reports whole correlated gene groups as discovered\nbiomarkers for prediction tasks, allowing researchers to conduct follow-up\nstudies to identify causal genes within the identified groups.\n  Result: Using real benchmark scRNA-seq datasets with simulated cell\nphenotypes, we demonstrate our novel method significantly outperforms standard\nmodels in both (1) prediction of cell phenotypes and (2) feature gene\nselection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 22:14:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 20:19:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 23:02:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 01:04:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-11"}

Most existing dynamic\npricing policy, which focus on the faithfulness of adopted customer choice\nmodels, exhibit a limited capability for adapting the online uncertainty of\nlearned statistical model during pricing process. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel approach for designing dynamic pricing policy based regularized online\nstatistical learning with theoretical guarantees. The new approach overcomes\nthe challenge of continuous monitoring of online Lasso procedure and possesses\nseveral appealing properties. In particular, we make the decisive observation\nthat the always-validity of pricing decisions builds and thrives on the online\nregularization scheme. Our proposed online regularization scheme equips the\nproposed optimistic online regularized maximum likelihood pricing (OORMLP)\npricing policy with three major advantages: encode market noise knowledge into\npricing process optimism; empower online statistical learning with\nalways-validity over all decision points; envelop prediction error process with\ntime-uniform non-asymptotic oracle inequalities. This type of non-asymptotic\ninference results allows us to design more sample-efficient and robust dynamic\npricing algorithms in practice. In theory, the proposed OORMLP algorithm\nexploits the sparsity structure of high-dimensional models and secures a\nlogarithmic regret in a decision horizon. These theoretical advances are made\npossible by proposing an optimistic online Lasso procedure that resolves\ndynamic pricing problems at the process level, based on a novel use of\nnon-asymptotic martingale concentration. In experiments, we evaluate OORMLP in\ndifferent synthetic and real pricing problem settings, and demonstrate that\nOORMLP advances the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 23:52:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Jan 2022 02:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

With this\ninformation, they can infer the quality of products to reduce the risk of\npurchase. Specifically, items with high rating scores and good reviews tend to\nbe less risky, while items with low rating scores and bad reviews might be\nrisky to purchase. On the other hand, the purchase behaviors will also be\ninfluenced by consumers' tolerance of risks, known as the risk attitudes.\nEconomists have studied risk attitudes for decades. These studies reveal that\npeople are not always rational enough when making decisions, and their risk\nattitudes may vary in different circumstances.\n  Most existing works over recommendation systems do not consider users' risk\nattitudes in modeling, which may lead to inappropriate recommendations to\nusers. For example, suggesting a risky item to a risk-averse person or a\nconservative item to a risk-seeking person may result in the reduction of user\nexperience. In this paper, we propose a novel risk-aware recommendation\nframework that integrates machine learning and behavioral economics to uncover\nthe risk mechanism behind users' purchasing behaviors. Concretely, we first\ndevelop statistical methods to estimate the risk distribution of each item and\nthen draw the Nobel-award winning Prospect Theory into our model to learn how\nusers choose from probabilistic alternatives that involve risks, where the\nprobabilities of the outcomes are uncertain. Experiments on several e-commerce\ndatasets demonstrate that our approach can achieve better performance than many\nclassical recommendation approaches, and further analyses also verify the\nadvantages of risk-aware recommendation beyond accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 00:16:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

In turn, through a comprehensive\nanalysis of $\\ell_2$-regularized GD trajectories, we prove that for\noverparametrized one-hidden-layer ReLU neural network with the $\\ell_2$\nregularization: (1) the output is close to that of the kernel ridge regression\nwith the corresponding neural tangent kernel; (2) minimax {optimal} rate of\n$L_2$ estimation error can be achieved. Numerical experiments confirm our\ntheory and further demonstrate that the $\\ell_2$ regularization approach\nimproves the training robustness and works for a wider range of neural\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 01:02:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2021 12:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

Identifying the\ncondensed-matter Higgs mode is challenging because it is known in many cases to\ndecay rapidly into other low-energy bosonic modes, which renders the Higgs mode\ninvisible. Therefore, it is desirable to find a way to stabilize the Higgs\nmode, which can offer an insight into the stabilization mechanism of the Higgs\nmode in condensed matter physics. In quantum magnets, magnetic order caused by\nspontaneous symmetry breaking supports transverse (magnons) and longitudinal\n(Higgs modes) fluctuations. When a continuous symmetry is broken, the Goldstone\nmagnon mode generally has a lower excitation energy than the Higgs mode,\ncausing a rapid decay of the latter. In this work, we show that a stable Higgs\nmode exists in anisotropic quantum magnets near the quantum critical point\nbetween the dimerized and magnetically ordered phases. We find that an easy\naxis anisotropy increases the magnon gap such that the magnon mode is above the\nHiggs mode near the quantum critical point, and the decay of the Higgs mode\ninto the magnon mode is forbidden kinematically. Our results suggest that the\nanisotropic quantum magnets provide ideal platforms to explore the Higgs\nphysics in condensed matter systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 02:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-09"}

When a BIE on such a geometry is\ndiscretized using the Nystr\\\"{o}m method based on the Trapezoidal quadrature\nrule, the resulting scheme tends to converge only slowly, due to the\nsingularity in the kernel function. The key finding of the manuscript is that\nthe convergence order can be greatly improved by modifying only a very small\nnumber of elements in the coefficient matrix. Specifically, it is demonstrated\nthat by correcting only the diagonal entries in the coefficient matrix,\n$O(h^{3})$ convergence can be attained for the single and double layer\npotentials associated with both the Laplace and the Helmholtz kernels. A\nnine-point correction stencil leads to an $O(h^5)$ scheme.

To this end, we encode the\ntarget agent history trajectories as an attention mask and construct a social\nmap to encode the interactive relationship between the target agent and its\nsurrounding agents. Given a trajectory sequence, the LSTM networks are firstly\nutilized to extract the features for all agents, based on which the attention\nmask and social map are formed. Then, the attention mask and social map are\nfused to get the fusion feature map, which is processed by the social\nconvolution to obtain a fusion feature representation.

We note that the variable-length LSTM enables\nour model to handle the case that the number of agents in the sensing scope is\nhighly dynamic in traffic scenes.

A particularly famous example is the dressed state formalism proposed by\nKulish and Faddeev in quantum electrodynamics (QED). As pointed out by Hirai\nand Sugishita, however, this formalism has problems in gauge invariance and the\nIR divergence. These problems are mainly caused by the existence of ghosts or\nunphysical photon modes. Therefore, we start by studying the asymptotic states\nin the Coulomb gauge, which excludes ghosts and/or unphysical photon modes. In\nthis paper, we propose a formalism to construct the asymptotic states directly\nfrom the interaction of the theory by setting a sufficiently large time scale\n$T$. In this dressed state formalism, we define the asymptotic interaction\nremaining at $|t|>T$ in terms of some fixed order of $1/T$, and we are\nperforming all calculations according to that order. We study the asymptotic\nstates in QED specifically, but we can formally apply the dressed state\nformalism proposed in this paper to any perturbative QFT.

For each spherical\nharmonic of the magnetic field, the expansion contains a finite number of\nterms. A multipole magnetic field can provide an explanation for the stable\nsub-structures of pulses, and they offer a solution to the problem of current\nclosure in pulsar magnetospheres. Conclusions. This computation generalises the\nwidely used model of a rotating star in vacuum with a dipole field. It can be\nespecially useful as a first approximation to the electromagnetic environment\nof a compact star, for instance a neutron star, with an arbitrarily magnetic\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 05:50:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

Tidally\nlocked terrestrial planets around M dwarfs are the main targets of space\nmissions looking to discover habitable exoplanets. The question of whether\nhurricanes can form on this kind of planet is important for determining their\nclimate and habitability. Using a high-resolution global atmospheric\ncirculation model, we investigated whether there are hurricanes on tidally\nlocked terrestrial planets under fixed surface temperatures. The relevant\neffects of the planetary rotation rate, surface temperature, and bulk\natmospheric compositions were examined. We find that hurricanes can form on the\nplanets but not on all of them. For planets near the inner edge of the\nhabitable zone of late M dwarfs, there are more numerous and stronger\nhurricanes on both day and night sides. For planets in the middle and outer\nranges of the habitable zone, the possibility of hurricane formation is low or\neven close to zero, as has been suggested in recent studies. Earth-based\nhurricane theories are applicable to tidally locked planets only when the\natmospheric compositions are similar to that of Earth. However, if the\nbackground atmosphere is lighter than H2O, hurricanes can hardly be produced\nbecause convection is always inhibited due to the effect of the mean molecular\nweight, similarly to the case of Saturn. These results have broad implications\non the precipitation, ocean mixing, climate, and atmospheric characterization\nof tidally locked planets.

However, modeling the true dynamics of present-day increasingly\ncomplex systems can be an extremely challenging task; and the usually necessary\npractical approximations often render the automation system to operate in a\nnon-optimal condition. This problem can be greatly aggravated in the case of a\nmulti-axis magnetically-levitated nanopositioning system where the fully\nfloating behavior and multi-axis coupling make extremely accurate\nidentification of the motion dynamics largely impossible. On the other hand, in\nmany related industrial automation applications, e.g., the scanning process\nwith the maglev system, repetitive motions are involved which could generate a\nlarge amount of motion data under non-optimal conditions. These motion data\nessentially contain rich information; therefore, the possibility exists to\ndevelop an intelligent automation system to learn from these motion data and to\ndrive the system to operate towards optimality in a data-driven manner. Along\nthis line then, this paper proposes a data-driven controller optimization\napproach that learns from the past non-optimal motion data to iteratively\nimprove the motion control performance. Specifically, a novel data-driven\nmulti-objective optimization approach is proposed that is able to automatically\nestimate the gradient and Hessian purely based on the measured motion data; the\nmulti-objective cost function is suitably designed to take into account both\nsmooth and accurate trajectory tracking. Experiments are then conducted on the\nmaglev nanopositioning system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod, and the results show rather clearly the practical appeal of our\nmethodology for related complex robotic systems with no accurate model\navailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 09:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

We show that\nadding a random step to FGSM, as proposed in Wong et al.

However, little is known about how the fraction\nof compressive and solenoidal modes in the velocity field evolves over time and\nhow it depends on properties of the molecular cloud or the galactic\nenvironment. In this work, we carry out magnetohydrodynamical simulations of\ndisc galaxies and study the time evolution of the turbulence driving parameter\nfor an ensemble of clouds. We find that the time-averaged turbulence driving\nparameter is insensitive to the position of the cloud within the galaxy. The\nensemble-averaged driving parameter is found to be rather compressive with\n$b\\sim0.5-0.7$, indicating almost time-independent global star formation\nproperties. However, each individual cloud shows a highly fluctuating driving\nparameter, which would strongly affect the cloud's star formation rate. We find\nthat the mode of turbulence driving can rapidly change within only a few Myr,\nboth from solenoidal to compressive and vice versa. We attribute these changes\nto cloud collisions and to tidal interactions with clouds or overdensities in\nthe environment. Last, we find no significant differences in the average\ndriving parameter between hydrodynamic and initially strongly magnetised\ngalaxies. However, the magnetic field tends to reduce the overall fluctuation\nof the driving parameter. The average driving as well as its uncertainty are\nseen to be in agreement with recent constraints on the turbulence driving mode\nfor solar neighbourhood clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 10:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

The aim is to build a spectroscopic\ncalibration sample that is as representative as possible of the galaxies of the\nEuclid weak lensing sample. In order to minimise the number of spectroscopic\nobservations to fill the gaps in current knowledge of the P(z|C),\nself-organising map (SOM) representations of the galaxy colour space have been\nconstructed.

While there\nhave been some efforts in increasing the dynamic field range of xMR sensors,\nHall sensors remain to dominate high field applications due to their wide\nlinear range. Using a perpendicular magnetized reference system and an in-plane\nfree layer allows us to overcome this disadvantage of xMR sensors, and,\nfurthermore, investigate spin-canting effects in interlayer exchange coupled\nperpendicular synthetic antiferromagnets (p-SAF). We created p-SAFs with\nexchange coupling fields of up to 10 kOe, based on magnetic Co/Pt multilayer\nsystems. The p-SAFs are either designed as \"single\" p-SAFs, where two Co/Pt\nmultilayers are interlayer exchange coupled via a 4 {\\AA} thick Ru spacer, or\nas \"double\" p-SAFs, where an additional Co layer is interlayer exchange coupled\nto the top multilayer. These p-SAFs are used for giant magnetoresistance (GMR)\nsensors with wide dynamic field range. By using a p-SAF as the reference system\nand employing an in-plane magnetic layer as the GMR's free layer, the linear\nrange can be effectively increased limited only by the p-SAF's switching\nfields. Additionally, the magnetic anisotropy of the in-plane free layer is\nfully controlled, which allows saturation fields by design. Different\nconfigurations were investigated, ranging from free layer magnetic saturation\nat lower to far higher fields than the p-SAF's switching fields. We can show\nthrough micromagnetic simulations that certain GMR transfer curves are\ndominated by spin-canting effects in the interlayer exchange coupled reference\nsystem. Finally, our simulation results lay out the correlation of the p-SAF's\ndesign parameters and its magnetization reversal behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 11:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

Graph neural networks for HIN embeddings\ntypically adopt a hierarchical attention (including node-level and\nmeta-path-level attentions) to capture the information from meta-path-based\nneighbors. However, this complicated attention structure often cannot achieve\nthe function of selecting meta-paths due to severe overfitting. Moreover, when\npropagating information, these methods do not distinguish direct (one-hop)\nmeta-paths from indirect (multi-hop) ones. But from the perspective of network\nscience, direct relationships are often believed to be more essential, which\ncan only be used to model direct information propagation. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel neural network method via implicitly utilizing\nattention and meta-paths, which can relieve the severe overfitting brought by\nthe current over-parameterized attention mechanisms on HIN. We first use the\nmulti-layer graph convolutional network (GCN) framework, which performs a\ndiscriminative aggregation at each layer, along with stacking the information\npropagation of direct linked meta-paths layer-by-layer, realizing the function\nof attentions for selecting meta-paths in an indirect way. We then give an\neffective relaxation and improvement via introducing a new propagation\noperation which can be separated from aggregation. That is, we first model the\nwhole propagation process with well-defined probabilistic diffusion dynamics,\nand then introduce a random graph-based constraint which allows it to reduce\nnoise with the increase of layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the new approach over state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 11:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

By avoiding such costly transmissions, OTA computation schemes can\nachieve a better-than-linear (depending on the function, often logarithmic or\neven constant) scaling of the communication cost as the number of transmitters\ngrows. Among the most common functions computed OTA are linear functions such\nas weighted sums. In this work, we propose and analyze an analog OTA\ncomputation scheme for a class of functions that contains linear functions as\nwell as some nonlinear functions such as $p$-norms of vectors. We prove error\nbound guarantees that are valid for fast-fading channels and all distributions\nof fading and noise contained in the class of sub-Gaussian distributions. This\nclass includes Gaussian distributions, but also many other practically relevant\ncases such as Class A Middleton noise and fading with dominant line-of-sight\ncomponents. In addition, there can be correlations in the fading and noise so\nthat the presented results also apply to, for example, block fading channels\nand channels with bursty interference. We do not rely on any stochastic\ncharacterization of the distributed arguments of the OTA computed function; in\nparticular, there is no assumption that these arguments are drawn from\nidentical or independent probability distributions. Our analysis is\nnonasymptotic and therefore provides error bounds that are valid for a finite\nnumber of channel uses.

Therefore, to slow down the spread of this novel virus, the\nonly relevant initiatives are to maintain social distance, perform contact\ntracing, use proper safety gears, and impose quarantine measures.

Recent work has shown that magnetic fields are equally\nimportant for primordial clouds, which form the first stars in the Universe.\nWhile the primordial magnetic field strength on cosmic scales is largely\nunconstrained, theoretical models strongly suggest that a weak seed field\nexisted in the early Universe. We study how the amplification of such a weak\nfield can influence the evolution of accretion discs around first stars, and\nthus affect the primordial initial mass function (IMF). We perform a suite of\n3D ideal magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with different initial field\nstrengths and numerical resolutions. We find that, in simulations with\nsufficient spatial resolution to resolve the Jeans scale during the collapse,\neven initially weak magnetic fields grow exponentially to become dynamically\nimportant due to both the so-called 'small-scale turbulent dynamo' and the\n'large-scale mean-field dynamo'. Capturing the small-scale dynamo action\ndepends primarily on how well we resolve the Jeans length, while capturing the\nlarge-scale dynamo depends on the Jeans resolution as well as the maximum\nabsolute resolution. Provided enough resolution, we find that fragmentation\ndoes not depend strongly on the initial field strength, because even weak\nfields grow to become strong. However, fragmentation in runs with magnetic\nfields differs significantly from those without magnetic fields. We conclude\nthat the development of dynamically strong magnetic fields during the formation\nof the first stars is likely inevitable, and that these fields had a\nsignificant impact on the primordial IMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 12:24:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 22:25:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

In the real-world applications of e-commerce and social\nmedia, a sequence of user-item interactions generated within a certain period\nare grouped as a session, and these sessions consecutively arrive in the form\nof streams. Most of the recent SR research has focused on the static setting\nwhere the training data is first acquired and then used to train a\nsession-based recommender model. They need several epochs of training over the\nwhole dataset, which is infeasible in the streaming setting. Besides, they can\nhardly well capture long-term user interests because of the neglect or the\nsimple usage of the user information. Although some streaming recommendation\nstrategies have been proposed recently, they are designed for streams of\nindividual interactions rather than streams of sessions. In this paper, we\npropose a Global Attributed Graph (GAG) neural network model with a Wasserstein\nreservoir for the SSR problem. On one hand, when a new session arrives, a\nsession graph with a global attribute is constructed based on the current\nsession and its associate user. Thus, the GAG can take both the global\nattribute and the current session into consideration to learn more\ncomprehensive representations of the session and the user, yielding a better\nperformance in the recommendation. On the other hand, for the adaptation to the\nstreaming session scenario, a Wasserstein reservoir is proposed to help\npreserve a representative sketch of the historical data. Extensive experiments\non two real-world datasets have been conducted to verify the superiority of the\nGAG model compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 13:41:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 12:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-12"}

Our model is then applied to the study of\nthe post glitch rotational evolution in the Vela pulsar and in PSR J0537-6910.\nWe show that in both cases a turbulent model fits the evolution of the spin\nfrequency derivative better than a laminar one. We also predict that the second\nderivative of the frequency after a glitch should be correlated with the\nwaiting time since the previous glitch, which we find to be consistent with\nobservational data for these pulsars. The main conclusion of this paper is that\nin the post-glitch rotational evolution of these two pulsars we are most likely\nobserving the response to the glitch of a pinned turbulent region of the star\n(possibly the crust) and not the laminar response of a regular straight vortex\narray.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 13:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Those have to deal with completely different\nsituations, from atomically resolved phonon mapping to electron circular\ndichroism passing by surface plasmon mapping. All of them rely on very\ndifferent physical approximations and have not yet been reconciled, despite\nearly attempts to do so. As an effort in that direction, we report on the\ndevelopment of a scalar relativistic quantum electrodynamic (QED) approach of\nthe inelastic scattering of fast electrons. This theory can be adapted to\ndescribe all modern EELS experiments, and under the relevant approximations,\ncan be reduced to any of the last EELS theories. In that aim, we present in\nthis paper the state of the art and the basics of scalar relativistic QED\nrelevant to the electron inelastic scattering. We then give a clear relation\nbetween the two once antagonist descriptions of the EELS, the retarded green\nDyadic, usually applied to describe photonic excitations and the quasi-static\nmixed dynamic form factor (MDFF), more adapted to describe core electronic\nexcitations of material. We then use this theory to establish two important\nEELS-related equations. The first one relates the spatially resolved EELS to\nthe imaginary part of the photon propagator and the incoming and outgoing\nelectron beam wavefunction, synthesizing the most common theories developed for\nanalyzing spatially resolved EELS experiments. The second one shows that the\nevolution of the electron beam density matrix is proportional to the mutual\ncoherence tensor, proving that quite universally, the electromagnetic\ncorrelations in the target are imprinted in the coherence properties of the\nprobing electron beam.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 14:20:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 09:46:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 10:12:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

RSA\ntherefore first quantifies the representational geometry by calculating a\ndissimilarity measure for each pair of conditions, and then compares the\nestimated representational dissimilarities to those predicted by each model.\nHere we address two central challenges of RSA: First, dissimilarity measures\nsuch as the Euclidean, Mahalanobis, and correlation distance, are biased by\nmeasurement noise, which can lead to incorrect inferences.

In the former case, stream\nprocessing technologies are required to operate on the data; in the latter\nbatch analytics and queries are of common use.\n  This paper introduces a runtime to dynamically construct data stream\nprocessing topologies based on user-supplied code. These dynamic topologies are\nbuilt on-the-fly using a data subscription model defined by the applications\nthat consume data. Each user-defined processing unit is called a Service\nObject. Every Service Object consumes input data streams and may produce output\nstreams that others can consume. The subscription-based programing model\nenables multiple users to deploy their own data-processing services. The\nruntime does the dynamic forwarding of data and execution of Service Objects\nfrom different users. Data streams can originate in real-world devices or they\ncan be the outputs of Service Objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 15:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

Researchers and technology companies such as Google and\nApple have offered to develop such tools in the form of contact tracing\napplications. The goal of these applications is to continuously track people's\nproximity and to make the smartphone users aware if they have ever been in\ncontact with positively diagnosed people, so that they could self-quarantine\nand possibly have an infection test. A fundamental challenge with these\nsmartphone-based contact tracing technologies is to ensure the security and\nprivacy of their users. Moving from manual to smartphone-based contact tracing\ncreates new cyber risks that could suddenly affect the entire population. Major\nrisks include for example the abuse of the people's private data by companies\nand/or authorities, or the spreading of wrong alerts by malicious users in\norder to force individuals to go into quarantine.

The sub-class of conformal theories for which the\nnumber of fundamental hypermultiplets does not scale with N differs in the\nplanar limit from the N=4 SYM theory only in observables involving chiral\noperators of odd dimension.

The Higgs field enters the symmetry break to\nrelate the strong and electroweak energy scales by exchange of one quantum of\naction between the two sectors. This shapes the Higgs potential to fourth\norder. Recently intrinsic quantum mechanics has given a suggestion for the\nCabibbo angle from theory (EPL124-2018) and a prediction for the Higgs\ncouplings to gauge bosons (EPL125-2019).

By analyzing recent research, we observe\nthat bypasses of defensive solutions that enforce control-flow integrity or\nattempt to detect return-oriented programming require memory disclosure attacks\nas a fundamental first step. However, research lags behind in detecting such\ninformation leaks.\n  In this paper, we tackle this problem and present a system for fine-grained,\nautomated detection of memory disclosure attacks against scripting engines. The\nbasic insight is as follows: scripting languages, such as JavaScript in web\nbrowsers, are strictly sandboxed. They must not provide any insights about the\nmemory layout in their contexts. In fact, any such information potentially\nrepresents an ongoing memory disclosure attack. Hence, to detect information\nleaks, our system creates a clone of the scripting engine process with a\nre-randomized memory layout. The clone is instrumented to be synchronized with\nthe original process. Any inconsistency in the script contexts of both\nprocesses appears when a memory disclosure was conducted to leak information\nabout the memory layout.

The construction of this phase field model is informed\nby micromechanical modeling through the homogenization theory, where the\nrepresentative volume element (RVE) has a planar crack in the center. The\nproposed model is made closely match the response of the RVE, including the\nfrictionless self-contact condition. This homogenization approach allows to\nidentify a direction-dependent phase field model with the tension-compression\nsplit obtained from cracked microstructures. One important feature of the\nproposed model is that unlike most other models, the material degradation is\nconsistently determined without artificial assumptions or ad hoc parameters\nwith no physical interpretation, thus, a more realistic modeling is resulted.\nWith standard tests such as uniaxial loadings, three-point bending, simple\nshear, and through-crack tests, the proposed model predicts reasonable crack\npaths. Moreover, with the RVE response as a benchmark, the proposed model gives\nrise to an accurate stress-strain curve under shear loads, more accurate than\nmost existing models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 15:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

Firstly, their calculations arbitrarily cut\noff after 13 weeks, without costing the epidemic end state. That is, they\nassume indifference between mid-September states of 13 or 7500 weekly deaths\nand corresponding infection rates.

Even under\nthese assumptions it is very questionable. Secondly, they ignore the costs of\nserious illness, possible long-term lowering of life quality and expectancy for\nsurvivors. These are uncertain, but plausibly at least as large as the costs in\ndeaths.\n  In summary, policy on tackling COVID-19 cannot be rationally made without\nestimating probabilities of future medical interventions and long-term illness\ncosts.
