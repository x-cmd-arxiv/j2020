The phonon spectrum reveals parity breaking while preserving\ntime-reversal symmetry, i.e. it possesses true chirality. We find that\nhybridization of the micro-rotational and translational modes gives rise to the\nacoustic phonon branch with a \"roton\" minimum reminiscent of the elementary\nexcitations in the superfluid helium-4.

The comparison between the two approaches after a laser pulse\nexcitation shows a good agreement in the weak and the intermediate photo-doping\nregime.

The outflow is resolved, revealing a 150\npc long, clumpy, high-velocity, collimated molecular jet. The molecular\nemission is emerging from the spine of the jet with an average diameter of 3-7\npc. A narrow-angle, rotating molecular wind surrounds the jet and is enveloped\nby a larger-scale, slower CO-emitting structure. The jet and narrow wind are\nturbulent ($\\sigma>$40 kms$^{-1}$) and have steep radial gas excitation\ngradients. The jet shows velocity reversals that we propose are caused by\nprecession, or episodic directional changes. We suggest that an important\nprocess powering the outflow is magneto-centrifugal driving. In contrast, the\nlarge-scale CO-envelope may be a slow wind, or cocoon that stems from jet-wind\ninteractions.

Direct imaging provides a steady flow of newly discovered giant\nplanets and brown dwarf companions. These multi-object systems can provide\ninformation about the formation of low-mass companions in wide orbits and/or\nhelp us to speculate about possible migration scenarios. Accurate\nclassification of companions is crucial for testing formation pathways. Aims.\nIn this work we further characterise the recently discovered candidate for a\nplanetary-mass companion CS Cha b and determine if it is still accreting.\nMethods. MUSE is a four-laser-adaptive-optics-assisted medium-resolution\nintegral-field spectrograph in the optical part of the spectrum. We observed\nthe CS Cha system to obtain the first spectrum of CS Cha b. The companion is\ncharacterised by modelling both the spectrum from 6300 $\\unicode{x212B}$ to\n9300 $\\unicode{x212B}$ and the photometry using archival data from the visible\nto the near-infrared (NIR).

Conclusions. Our results show that CS Cha B is most likely a\nmid-M-type star that is obscured by a highly inclined disc, which has led to\nits previous classification using broadband NIR photometry as a planetary-mass\ncompanion. This shows that it is important and necessary to observe over a\nbroad spectral range to constrain the nature of faint companions\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 16:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

A class of graphs $C$ is monadically stable\nif it is impossible to define arbitrarily long linear orders in vertex-colored\ngraphs from $C$ using a fixed first-order formula. Similarly, monadic\ndependence corresponds to the impossibility of defining all graphs in this way.\nExamples of monadically stable graph classes are nowhere dense classes, which\nprovide a robust theory of sparsity. Examples of monadically dependent classes\nare classes of bounded rankwidth (or equivalently, bounded cliquewidth), which\ncan be seen as a dense analog of classes of bounded treewidth.

Yet, any such\nrepresentative sample should sufficiently portray the underlying dialect\ndiversity to present the voices of different participating communities\nrepresenting the dialects. Extractive summarization algorithms perform the task\nof constructing subsets that succinctly capture the topic of any given set of\nposts. However, we observe that there is dialect bias in the summaries\ngenerated by common summarization approaches, i.e., they often return summaries\nthat under-represent certain dialects.\n  The vast majority of existing \"fair\" summarization approaches require\nsocially salient attribute labels (in this case, dialect) to ensure that the\ngenerated summary is fair with respect to the socially salient attribute.\nNevertheless, in many applications, these labels do not exist. Furthermore, due\nto the ever-evolving nature of dialects in social media, it is unreasonable to\nlabel or accurately infer the dialect of every social media post. To correct\nfor the dialect bias, we employ a framework that takes an existing text\nsummarization algorithm as a blackbox and, using a small set of dialect-diverse\nsentences, returns a summary that is relatively more dialect-diverse.\nCrucially, this approach does not need the posts being summarized to have\ndialect labels, ensuring that the diversification process is independent of\ndialect classification/identification models.

The control parameters of the crossover is the ratio\nbetween persistence length of the active motion and the typical length scale of\nthe circular domain. We explore the possibility of taking advantage of this\nfinding for sorting active particles by motility parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 17:35:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

We have used the photochromic reaction of a\nspiropyran surfactant to render interfacial, rising bubble as well as foaming\nproperties active to light stimuli. In order to address the air-water\ninterface, we have applied sum-frequency generation (SFG) which has provided\nqualitative information on the surface excess and the interfacial charging\nstate as a function of light irradiation and pH. Under blue light, the\nsurfactant forms a closed ring spiro form (SP), whereas under dark conditions\nthe ring opens and the merocyanine (MC) form is generated. Using SFG, we show\nthat different pH conditions of the bulk solution lead to changes in the\ninterfacial charging state. We have exploited the fact that the MC surfactant's\nO-H group can be deprotonated with pH, and used that to tune the molecules net\ncharge at the interface. In fact, SFG shows that with increasing pH the\nintensity of the OH stretching band from interfacial water molecules increases\nwhich we associate to an increase in surface net charge. At a pH of 5.3,\nirradiation with blue light leads to a reversible decrease of OH intensities,\nwhereas the CH intensities were unchanged compared to the corresponding\nintensities under dark conditions. These results are indicative of changes in\nthe surface net charge with light, which are also expected to influence the\nfoam stability via changes in the electrostatic disjoining pressure. In fact,\nmeasurements of the foam stabilities are consistent with this hypothesis with\nhigher foam stability in the dark. At pH 2.7 this behavior is reversed. This is\ncorroborated by rising bubble experiments, which demonstrated an unprecedented\nreduction of ~30% in bubble velocity when the bubbles were irradiated with blue\nlight compared to the velocity of bubbles with the surfactants in the dark\nstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 17:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-16"}

The most prominent approach for anomaly estimation is to compute the\nMaximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of the anomaly; however, it was recently\nobserved that for normally distributed data, the MLE is a $\\textit{biased}$\nestimator for some anomaly families. In this work, we demonstrate that in the\nnormal means setting, the bias of the MLE depends on the size of the anomaly\nfamily.

We test this prediction with simultaneous\nNuSTAR and Fermi/LAT observations of nova V906 Car, which exhibited the\nbrightest GeV gamma-ray emission to date. The nova is detected in hard X-rays\nwhile it is still gamma-ray bright, but contrary to simple theoretical\nexpectations, the detected 3.5-78 keV emission of V906 Car is much weaker than\nthe simultaneously observed >100 MeV emission. No non-thermal X-ray emission is\ndetected, and our deep limits imply that the gamma-rays are likely hadronic.\nAfter correcting for substantial absorption (N_H ~ 2 x 10^23 cm^-2), the\nthermal X-ray luminosity (from a 9 keV optically-thin plasma) is just ~2% of\nthe gamma-ray luminosity. We consider possible explanations for the low thermal\nX-ray luminosity, including the X-rays being suppressed by corrugated,\nradiative shock fronts or the X-rays from the gamma-ray producing shock are\nhidden behind an even larger absorbing column (N_H >10^25 cm^-2). Adding\nXMM-Newton and Swift/XRT observations to our analysis, we find that the\nevolution of the intrinsic X-ray absorption requires the nova shell to be\nexpelled 24 days after the outburst onset. The X-ray spectra show that the\nejecta are enhanced in nitrogen and oxygen, and the nova occurred on the\nsurface of a CO-type white dwarf. We see no indication of a distinct super-soft\nphase in the X-ray lightcurve, which, after considering the absorption effects,\nmay point to a low mass of the white dwarf hosting the nova.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 17:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

Recent observations from ALMA suggest that planet formation\nmay already be well under way after only 1 Myr of a star's life. However, stars\ndo not form in isolation; they form from the collapse and fragmentation of\ngiant molecular clouds several parsecs in size. This results in young stars\nforming in groups - often referred to as 'clusters'. In these star-forming\nregions the stellar density is much higher than the location of the Sun, and\nother stars in the Galactic disc that host exoplanets. As such, the environment\nwhere stars form has the potential to influence the planet formation process.\nIn star-forming regions, protoplanetary discs can be truncated or destroyed by\ninteractions with passing stars, as well as photoevaporation from the radiation\nfields of very massive stars. Once formed, the planets themselves can have\ntheir orbits altered by dynamical encounters - either directly from passing\nstars or through secondary effects such as the Kozai-Lidov mechanism. In this\ncontribution, I review the different processes that can affect planet formation\nand stability in star-forming regions.

We revisit the original topological dark matter scenario, focusing\non hidden-sector magnetic monopoles, and consider more general cosmological\nhistories. We find that a monopole mass of order ($1-10^5$) PeV is generic for\nthe thermal histories considered here, if monopoles are to entirely reproduce\nthe current abundance of dark matter. In particular, in a scenario involving an\nearly era of matter domination, the monopole number density is always less than\nor equal to that in a pure radiation dominated equivalent provided a certain\ncondition on critical exponents is satisfied. This results in a larger monopole\nmass needed to account for a fixed relic abundance in such cosmologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 18:02:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 04:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

In accordance to their nature, the premise is that they provide\nboth good estimates for class overlap, and great correlations with the\nclassification performance. For that purpose, a novel family of metrics have\nbeen developed. Being based on ball coverage by classes, they are named after\nOverlap Number of Balls. Finally, some prospects for the adaptation of the\nformer family of metrics to singular (more complex) problems are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 18:21:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

The extraordinary coronal flaring activity is thought\nto be the origin of compact radio emission and other associated phenomena as\nlarge slingshot prominences. Aim: We aim to investigate the radio emission\nmechanism and the milliarcsecond radio structure around AB Dor A. Methods: We\nperformed phase-referenced VLBI observations at 22.3 GHz, 8.4 GHz, and 1.4 GHz\nover more than one decade using the Australian VLBI array. Results: Our 8.4 GHz\nimages show a double core-halo morphology, similar at all epochs, with emission\nextending at heights between 5 and 18 stellar radii. Furthermore, the sequence\nof the 8.4 GHz maps shows a clear variation of the source structure within the\nobserving time. However, images at 1.4 GHz and 22.3 GHz are compatible with a\ncompact source. The phase-reference position at 8.4 GHz and 1.4 GHz are\ncoincident with those expected from the well-known milliarcsecond-precise\nastrometry of this star, meanwhile the 22.3 GHz position is 4$\\sigma$ off the\nprediction in the north-west direction.

Conclusions: We have considered several models to explain the\nmorphology and evolution of the inner radio structure detected in AB Dor A\nwhich include emission from the stellar polar caps, a flaring,\nmagnetically-driven loop structure, and the presence of helmet streamers. A\npossible close companion to AB Dor A has been also investigated.

Implementation of active tunability of\nmetasurfaces promises compact flat optics capable of reconfigurable wavefront\nshaping. Phase-change materials (PCMs), such as germanium telluride or\ngermanium antimony telluride, are a prominent material class enabling\nreconfigurable metasurfaces due to their large refractive index change upon\nstructural transition. However, commonly employed laser-induced switching of\nPCMs limits the achievable feature sizes and thus, restricts device\nminiaturization. Here, we propose thermal scanning-probe-induced local\nswitching of germanium telluride to realize near-infrared metasurfaces with\nfeature sizes far below what is achievable with diffraction-limited optical\nswitching. Our design is based on a planar multilayer stack and does not\nrequire fabrication of protruding dielectric or metallic resonators as commonly\napplied in the literature. Instead, we numerically demonstrate that a\nbroad-band tuning of perfect absorption could be realized by the localized and\ncontrolled tip-induced crystallization of the PCM layer. The spectral response\nof the metasurface is explained using simple resonance mode analysis and\nnumerical simulations. To facilitate experimental realization, we provide a\ndetailed theoretical description of the tip-induced crystallization employing\nmultiphysics simulations to demonstrate the great potential for fabricating\ncompact reconfigurable metasurfaces. Our concept allows for tunable perfect\nabsorption and can be applied not only for thermal imaging or sensing, but also\nfor spatial frequency filtering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 18:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-17"}

Although many studies focus on $\\eta$, less work has\nbeen devoted to $m$. It has been recently demonstrated [M. Masmoudi \\textit{et\nal}. Granular Matter 18 (2016) 71.] that $m$ non-linearly depends on the\ndriving acceleration $\\gamma$ according to a power law, $m\\propto\\gamma^k$.\nExperiments using 3D packings of particles suggest $k=-2$. However, simulations\nwith 1D columns of particles on a vibrating plate and theoretical predictions\nbased on the inelastic bouncing ball model (IBBM) suggest that $k=-1$. These\nfindings left open questions whether m may depend on the dimensionality of the\npacking or on lateral interactions between walls and grains. In turn, $\\eta$\nwas shown to follow a universal curve, $\\eta\\propto\\gamma^{-1}$, whatever the\ndimensionality and the constraints in the motion of the grains. In this work,\nwe consider PD under different confinement conditions in the motion of the\nparticles (1D, quasi-1D, quasi-2D and 3D). We find that the dynamical response\nof the PD ($m$ and $\\eta$) is not sensitive to the lateral confinement or\ndimensionality. However, we have observed two distinct regimes: (i) In the\ninertial regime, $\\eta$ decays according to the IBBM for all dimensions,\n$\\eta\\propto\\gamma^{-1}$, while $m$ falls with an apparent power law behaviour\nthat matches Masmoudi's experiments, $m\\propto\\gamma^{-2}$, for all dimensions\nbut only in the range of moderate acceleration, before becoming negative for\nvery high accelerations. (ii) In the quasi-static regime, both $m$ and $\\eta$\ndisplay a complex behavior as functions of the excitation amplitude, but tend\nto the IBBM prediction, $m\\propto\\gamma^{-1}$ and $\\eta\\propto\\gamma^{-1}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 19:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-17"}

An important issue is to determine whether this spatial pattern is a\nconsequence of environmental heterogeneities, such as the climatic conditions,\nduring the course of the outbreak. Another fundamental issue is to understand\nthe spatial spreading of COVID-19. To address these questions, we consider four\ncandidate epidemiological models with varying complexity in terms of initial\nconditions, contact rates and non-local transmissions, and we fit them to\nFrench mortality data with a mixed probabilistic-ODE approach. Using standard\nstatistical criteria, we select the model with non-local transmission\ncorresponding to a diffusion on the graph of counties that depends on the\ngeographic proximity, with time-dependent contact rate and spatially constant\nparameters. This original spatially parsimonious model suggests that in a\ngeographically middle size centralized country such as France, once the\nepidemic is established, the effect of global processes such as restriction\npolicies, sanitary measures and social distancing overwhelms the effect of\nlocal factors. Additionally, this modeling approach reveals the latent\nepidemiological dynamics including the local level of immunity, and allows us\nto evaluate the role of non-local interactions on the future spread of the\ndisease.

An\nimportant aspect of query expansion is choosing an appropriate way to combine\nthe images into a new query. Interestingly, despite the undeniable empirical\nsuccess of query expansion, ad-hoc methods with different caveats have\ndominated the landscape, and not a lot of research has been done on learning\nhow to do query expansion. In this paper we propose a more principled framework\nto query expansion, where one trains, in a discriminative manner, a model that\nlearns how images should be aggregated to form the expanded query. Within this\nframework, we propose a model that leverages a self-attention mechanism to\neffectively learn how to transfer information between the different images\nbefore aggregating them. Our approach obtains higher accuracy than existing\napproaches on standard benchmarks. More importantly, our approach is the only\none that consistently shows high accuracy under different regimes, overcoming\ncaveats of existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 22:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-17"}

Thanks to the\nremarkable behaviour of glide symmetry, the meta-structures are used both as\nwide-band EBG material to confine the field in the guide and as low-dispersive\nguiding medium filling the guide itself. The reconfigurability is achieved by\nadjusting the displacement between the metasurfaces. A higher displacement\nenables propagation within the waveguide and a lower displacement suppresses\nit. A two-state reconfigurability is therefore designed, allowing the device to\nact as an on-off switch in the V-band. In particular, a dispersion analysis\nhighlights the potential of such technology to achieve switching operating over\na 55-66 GHz frequency range. A complete design including matching mechanism and\nWR15 feeding is also described and shown to exhibit a $S_{11}<-10$ dB bandwidth\nfrom 57.4 to 62.8 GHz.

Detecting such patterns is the\ncentral objective of the variational approach to conformational dynamics (VAC),\nas well as the related methods of time-lagged independent component analysis\nand Markov state modeling. In VAC, the search for slowly decorrelating patterns\nis formalized as a variational problem solved by the eigenfunctions of the\nsystem's transition operator. VAC computes solutions to this variational\nproblem by optimizing a linear or nonlinear model of the eigenfunctions using\ntime series data. Here, we build on VAC's success by addressing two practical\nlimitations. First, VAC can give poor eigenfunction estimates when the lag time\nparameter is chosen poorly. Second, VAC can overfit when using flexible\nparameterizations such as artificial neural networks with insufficient\nregularization.

Agents trained by current approaches typically suffer from\nthis and would consequently struggle to avoid random and inefficient actions at\nevery step.

The goals of this\nadaptive-optics imaging study were threefold: to characterize the shape of\nEuphrosyne, to constrain its density, and to search for the large craters that\nmay be associated with the family formation event. We obtained disk-resolved\nimages of Euphrosyne using SPHERE/ZIMPOL at ESO's 8.2-m VLT as part of our\nlarge program (ID: 199.C-0074, PI: Vernazza).

One crucial component to support effective\nride-sharing is the matching mechanism that pairs up suitable commuters.\nTraditionally, matching has been performed in a centralized manner, whereby an\noperator arranges ride-sharing according to a global objective (e.g., total\ncost of all commuters). However, ride-sharing is a decentralized\ndecision-making paradigm, where commuters are self-interested and only\nmotivated to team up based on individual payments.

Recent work has\nmade use of a generalized hypergraph cut function which for a hypergraph\n$\\mathcal{H} = (V,E)$ can be defined by associating each hyperedge $e \\in E$\nwith a splitting function ${\\bf w}_e$, which assigns a penalty to each way of\nseparating the nodes of $e$. When each ${\\bf w}_e$ is a submodular\ncardinality-based splitting function, meaning that ${\\bf w}_e(S) = g(|S|)$ for\nsome concave function $g$, previous work has shown that a generalized\nhypergraph cut problem can be reduced to a directed graph cut problem on an\naugmented node set. However, existing reduction procedures often result in a\ndense graph, even when the hypergraph is sparse, which leads to slow runtimes\nfor algorithms that run on the reduced graph.\n  We introduce a new framework of sparsifying hypergraph-to-graph reductions,\nwhere a hypergraph cut defined by submodular cardinality-based splitting\nfunctions is $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximated by a cut on a directed graph. Our\ntechniques are based on approximating concave functions using piecewise linear\ncurves.

The general trend for the burst rate\nis qualitatively the same for all sources; the burst rate first increases with\nthe accretion rate up to a maximum, above which the burst rate declines,\ndespite the increasing accretion rate. At higher accretion rates, when the\nburst rate decreases, the {\\alpha}-value (the ratio of accretion energy and\nburst energy) increases by up to a factor of 10 above that in the rising burst\nrate regime.

In this approach, we achieve\ntracking of the position and orientation (pose) of a cable-like object, the\npose of its tip, and the pose of the selected grasp point on the object, which\nenables closed-loop manipulation of the object. We demonstrate the feasibility\nof our approach by completing the Plug Task used in the 2015 DARPA Robotics\nChallenge Finals, which involves unplugging a power cable from one socket and\nplugging it into another. Experiments show that we can successfully complete\nthe task autonomously within 30 seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 02:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-17"}

We hope that our work will\ninspire future research on characterizing and removing social biases from\nwidely adopted sentence representations for fairer NLP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 04:22:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-17"}

For a 4-f lens system, the\nspectral DOP at the back focal plane is independent of the transverse position\nof the beam, whereas it depends on the beam parameters such as mean value of\nrms beam-width, rms width of correlation function, and size of aperture placed\nat the Fourier plane of the lens system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 05:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-17"}

In particular, the surface\nexcess $\\Gamma$ of the surfactants changed drastically between E/Z isomers for\nAAP-TB (maximum change of $\\Gamma$: 2.15 $\\mu$mol/m$^2$); for Azo-TB the change\nwas only moderate (maximum change of $\\Gamma$: 1.02 $\\mu$mol/m$^2$).

In\ncontrast, only $\\Gamma$ and not the molecular order varied for Azo-TB.

Recently, meta-learning based methods have been shown as a\npromising direction for FSIC. Commonly, they train a meta-learner\n(meta-learning model) to learn easy fine-tuning weight, and when solving an\nFSIC task, the meta-learner efficiently fine-tunes itself to a task-specific\nmodel by updating itself on few images of the task. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel meta-learning based layer-wise adaptive updating (LWAU) method for FSIC.\nLWAU is inspired by an interesting finding that compared with common deep\nmodels, the meta-learner pays much more attention to update its top layer when\nlearning from few images. According to this finding, we assume that the\nmeta-learner may greatly prefer updating its top layer to updating its bottom\nlayers for better FSIC performance. Therefore, in LWAU, the meta-learner is\ntrained to learn not only the easy fine-tuning model but also its favorite\nlayer-wise adaptive updating rule to improve its learning efficiency. Extensive\nexperiments show that with the layer-wise adaptive updating rule, the proposed\nLWAU: 1) outperforms existing few-shot classification methods with a clear\nmargin; 2) learns from few images more efficiently by at least 5 times than\nexisting meta-learners when solving FSIC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 06:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

Current developments of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), offer a\nnovel approach for fetal landmarks detection. In this task 15 agents are\ndeployed to detect 15 landmarks simultaneously by DRL.

In this paper, we study subcarrier-wise backscatter\ncommunication over ambient OFDM signals. This new AmBC is to exploit the\nspecial spectrum structure of OFDM to transmit data over its squeezed\northogonal subcarriers. We propose a basis transmission scheme and its two\nmodifications to support a higher data rate with superior BER performance\ncompared to existing methods. The basis scheme can transmit one bit per\nsubcarrier using on-off keying (OOK) modulation in the frequency domain. In the\nfirst modification, interleaved subcarrier block transmission model is employed\nto improve the BER performance of the system in frequency-selective channels.\nIt results in a trade-off between the size of the blocks and data rate. Thus,\nin the second modification, interleaved index modulation (IM) is employed to\nmitigate the data rate decrementation of the former modification. It also\nstabilizes and controls the power of the signal to result in interference\nreduction for a legacy receiver.

Merging\ninformation from different sources opens up new possibilities for the\nestimation of causal effects. We show how causal effects can be identified and\nestimated by combining experiments and observations in real and realistic\nscenarios. As a new tool, we present do-search, a recently developed\nalgorithmic approach that can determine the identifiability of a causal effect.\nThe approach is based on do-calculus, and it can utilize data with non-trivial\nmissing data and selection bias mechanisms. When the effect is identifiable,\ndo-search outputs an identifying formula on which numerical estimation can be\nbased. When the effect is not identifiable, we can use do-search to recognize\nadditional data sources and assumptions that would make the effect\nidentifiable. Throughout the paper, we consider the effect of salt-adding\nbehavior on blood pressure mediated by the salt intake as an example. The\nidentifiability of this effect is resolved in various scenarios with different\nassumptions on confounding. There are scenarios where the causal effect is\nidentifiable from a chain of experiments but not from survey data, as well as\nscenarios where the opposite is true. As an illustration, we use survey data\nfrom NHANES 2013--2016 and the results from a meta-analysis of randomized\ncontrolled trials and estimate the reduction in average systolic blood pressure\nunder an intervention where the use of table salt is discontinued.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 08:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-17"}

Pre-specification of which covariates will be adjusted for (and how)\nis difficult, thus prompting the use of data-driven variable selection\nprocedures, which may impede valid inferences to be drawn.

One main reason is due to the filter-class entanglement -- an\nintricate many-to-many correspondence between filters and classes. Most\nexisting works attempt post-hoc interpretation on a pre-trained model, while\nneglecting to reduce the entanglement underlying the model. In contrast, we\nfocus on alleviating filter-class entanglement during training. Inspired by\ncellular differentiation, we propose a novel strategy to train interpretable\nCNNs by encouraging class-specific filters, among which each filter responds to\nonly one (or few) class.

The gate allows a filter's activation to pass only\nwhen the input samples come from the specific class. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the fabulous performance of our method in generating a sparse and\nhighly class-related representation of the input, which leads to stronger\ninterpretability. Moreover, comparing with the standard training strategy, our\nmodel displays benefits in applications like object localization and\nadversarial sample detection.

This model is\nbased on the multiplicative random cascade, which is designed to replicate the\nmultifractal nature of intermittency in developed turbulence. We present a\nmodified version of the multiplicative process where the spatial fluctuations\nas a function of scales are produced with the wavelet transforms of a\nfractional Brownian motion realisation. This simple approach produces naturally\na log-normal distribution function and hierarchical coherent structures.\nDespite the highly contrasted aspect of these coherent structures against a\nsmoother background, their Fourier power spectrum can be fitted by a single\npower law. As reported in previous works using the multiscale non-Gaussian\nsegmentation (MnGSeg) technique, it is proven that the fit of a single power\nlaw reflects the inability of the Fourier power spectrum to detect the\nprogressive non-Gaussian contributions that are at the origin of these\nstructures across the inertial range of the power spectrum. The mutifractal\nnature of these coherent structures is discussed, and an extension of the\nMnGSeg technique is proposed to calculate the multifractal spectrum that is\nassociated with them. Using directional wavelets, we show that filamentary\nstructures can easily be produced without changing the general shape of the\npower spectrum. The cumulative effect of random multiplicative sequences\nsucceeds in producing the general aspect of filamentary structures similar to\nthose associated with star-forming regions. The filamentary structures are\nformed through the product of a large number of random-phase linear waves at\ndifferent spatial wavelengths. Dynamically, this effect might be associated\nwith the collection of compressive processes that occur in the interstellar\nmedium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 09:31:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

To this end, firstly focusing on data\nprivacy, we propose heteromodal split learning with feature aggregation\n(HetSLAgg) that splits neural network (NN) models into camera-side and base\nstation (BS)-side segments. The BS-side NN segment fuses RF signals and\nuploaded image features without collecting raw images. However, the usage of\nmultiple visual data leads to an increase in NN input dimensions, which gives\nrise to additional communication and energy costs. To overcome additional\ncommunication and energy costs due to image interpolation to blend different\nframe rates, we propose a novel BS-side manifold mixup technique that offloads\nthe interpolation operations from cameras to a BS. Subsequently, we confront\nenergy costs for operating a larger size of the BS- side NN segment due to\nconcatenating image features across cameras and propose an energy-efficient\naggregation method. This is done via a linear combination of image features\ninstead of concatenating them, where the NN size is independent of the number\nof cameras. Comprehensive test-bed experiments with measured channels\ndemonstrate that HetSLAgg reduces the prediction error by 44% compared to a\nbaseline leveraging only RF received power. Moreover, the experiments show that\nthe designed HetSLAgg achieves over 20% gains in terms of communication and\nenergy cost reduction compared to several baseline designs within at most 1% of\naccuracy loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 09:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-17"}

The difficulty of this task is exacerbated\nin low resource settings that may not have access to biotechnology tests.\nFurthermore, Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health problem in several low-\nand middle-income countries and its common symptoms include fever, cough and\ntiredness, similarly to COVID-19. In order to help in the detection of\nCOVID-19, we propose the extraction of deep features (DF) from chest X-ray\nimages, a technology available in most hospitals, and their subsequent\nclassification using machine learning methods that do not require large\ncomputational resources. We compiled a five-class dataset of X-ray chest images\nincluding a balanced number of COVID-19, viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia,\nTB, and healthy cases. We compared the performance of pipelines combining 14\nindividual state-of-the-art pre-trained deep networks for DF extraction with\ntraditional machine learning classifiers. A pipeline consisting of ResNet-50\nfor DF computation and ensemble of subspace discriminant classifier was the\nbest performer in the classification of the five classes, achieving a detection\naccuracy of 91.6+ 2.6% (accuracy + 95% Confidence Interval). Furthermore, the\nsame pipeline achieved accuracies of 98.6+1.4% and 99.9+0.5% in simpler\nthree-class and two-class classification problems focused on distinguishing\nCOVID-19, TB and healthy cases; and COVID-19 and healthy images, respectively.\nThe pipeline was computationally efficient requiring just 0.19 second to\nextract DF per X-ray image and 2 minutes for training a traditional classifier\nwith more than 2000 images on a CPU machine. The results suggest the potential\nbenefits of using our pipeline in the detection of COVID-19, particularly in\nresource-limited settings and it can run with limited computational resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 09:49:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

Solar parks are built to increase renewable energy\npenetration and to supply local communities that become increasingly\nself-sufficient. These parks are generally installed in rural areas where\nelectricity grid distribution capacity is limited. This causes the produced\nenergy to create grid congestion. Temporary storage can be a solution. In\naddition to batteries, which are most suitable for intraday storage, hydrogen\nprovides a long-term storage option and can be used to overcome seasonal\nmismatches in supply and demand. In this paper, we examine the operational\ndecisions related to storing energy using hydrogen, and buying from or selling\nto the grid considering grid capacity limitations. We model the problem as a\nMarkov decision process taking into account seasonal production and demand\npatterns, uncertain solar energy generation, and local electricity prices. We\nshow that ignoring seasonal demand and production patterns is suboptimal. In\naddition, we show that the introduction of a hydrogen storage facility for a\nsolar farm in rural areas may lead to positive profits, whereas this is\nloss-making without storage facilities. In a sensitivity analysis, we show that\nonly if distribution capacity is too small, hydrogen storage does not lead to\nprofits and reduced congestion at the cable connection. When the distribution\ncapacity is constrained, a higher storage capacity leads to more buying-related\nactions from the electricity grid to prevent future shortages and to exploit\nprice differences. This leads to more congestion at the connected cable and is\nan important insight for policy-makers and net-operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 10:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

In standard, gas-dominated protoplanetary discs, low-mass planets or\nplanetary cores undergo rapid inwards migration and are lost to the central\nstar. However, several recent studies indicate that the solid component in\nprotoplanetary discs can have a significant dynamical effect on disc-planet\ninteraction, especially when the solid-to-gas mass ratio approaches unity or\nlarger and the dust-on-gas drag forces become significant. As there are several\nways to raise the solid abundance in protoplanetary discs, for example through\ndisc winds and dust-trapping in pressure bumps, it is important to understand\nhow planets migrate through a dusty environment. To this end, we study planet\nmigration in dust-rich discs via a systematic set of high-resolution,\ntwo-dimensional numerical simulations. We show that the inwards migration of\nlow-mass planets can be slowed down by dusty dynamical corotation torques. We\nalso identify a new regime of stochastic migration applicable to discs with\ndust-to-gas mass ratios $\\gtrsim 0.3$ and particle Stokes numbers $\\gtrsim\n0.03$. In these cases, disc-planet interaction leads to the continuous\ndevelopment of small-scale, intense dust vortices that scatter the planet,\nwhich can potentially halt or even reverse the inwards planet migration. We\nbriefly discuss the observational implications of our results and highlight\ndirections for future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 10:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

We used U-Net\nas the base architecture and modified that to improve its image segmentation\nperformance. In the proposed architecture (mrU-Net), the input image and its\ndown-sampled versions were used as the network inputs.

This information\nis encoded in the data, but most of it is lost when using conventional tools,\nsuch as one-point statistics and power spectra. The wavelet scattering\ntransform (WST), a low-variance statistical descriptor of non-Gaussian\nprocesses introduced in data science, opens a path towards this goal. We\napplied the WST to noise-free maps of dust polarized thermal emission computed\nfrom a numerical simulation of MHD turbulence. We analyzed normalized complex\nStokes maps and maps of the polarization fraction and polarization angle. The\nWST yields a few thousand coefficients; some of them measure the amplitude of\nthe signal at a given scale, and the others characterize the couplings between\nscales and orientations. The dependence on orientation can be fitted with the\nreduced WST (RWST), an angular model introduced in previous works. The RWST\nprovides a statistical description of the polarization maps, quantifying their\nmultiscale properties in terms of isotropic and anisotropic contributions. It\nallowed us to exhibit the dependence of the map structure on the orientation of\nthe mean magnetic field and to quantify the non-Gaussianity of the data.

Two intradecadal\noscillations, with 5.9yr and 8.5yr periods (referred to as SYO and EYO,\nrespectively), have been detected in previous studies. However, whether the SYO\nand the EYO have stable damping trends since 1962 and whether geomagnetic jerks\nare possible excitation sources for the SYO/EYO are still debated. In this\nstudy, based on different methods and dLOD records with different time span, we\nshow robust evidences to prove that the SYO and the EYO have no stable damping\ntrends since 1962, and we find that there is also a possible 7.6yr signal. To\nprove whether it is a periodic signal, we use the optimal sequence estimation\nmethod to stack 35 global geomagnetic records, the results also show an 7.6yr\nperiodic signal which has an Y2,-2 spatial distribution, and it has a high\ndegree of consistent synchronicity with the 7.6yr signal in dLOD.

In contrast to\nexisting counting models that directly output count values, we divide one-step\nestimation into a sequence of much easier and more tractable sub-decision\nproblems. Such sequential decision nature corresponds exactly to a physical\nprocess in reality scale weighing. Inspired by scale weighing, we propose a\nnovel 'counting scale' termed LibraNet where the count value is analogized by\nweight. By virtually placing a crowd image on one side of a scale, LibraNet\n(agent) sequentially learns to place appropriate weights on the other side to\nmatch the crowd count. At each step, LibraNet chooses one weight (action) from\nthe weight box (the pre-defined action pool) according to the current crowd\nimage features and weights placed on the scale pan (state). LibraNet is\nrequired to learn to balance the scale according to the feedback of the needle\n(Q values).

The power consumed in conversion grows with the\nsampling rate and quantization resolution, imposing a major challenge in\npower-limited systems. A common ADC architecture is based on sample-and-hold\n(S/H) circuits, where the analog signal is being tracked only for a fraction of\nthe sampling period. In this paper, we propose the concept of eSampling ADCs,\nwhich harvest energy from the analog signal during the time periods where the\nsignal is not being tracked. This harvested energy can be used to supplement\nthe ADC itself, paving the way to the possibility of zero-power consumption and\npower-saving ADCs. We analyze the tradeoff between the ability to recover the\nsampled signal and the energy harvested, and provide guidelines for setting the\nsampling rate in the light of accuracy and energy constraints. Our analysis\nindicates that eSampling ADCs operating with up to 12 bits per sample can\nacquire bandlimited analog signals such that they can be perfectly recovered\nwithout requiring power from the external source. Furthermore, our theoretical\nresults reveal that eSampling ADCs can in fact save power by harvesting more\nenergy than they consume. To verify the feasibility of eSampling ADCs, we\npresent a circuit-level design using standard complementary metal oxide\nsemiconductor (CMOS) 65 nm technology. An eSampling 8-bit ADC which samples at\n40 MHZ is designed on a Cadence Virtuoso platform.

We show that there is a bounded-error quantum\nalgorithm that determines all connected components of $G$ after making\n$O(\\log(n)^6)$ many cut queries. In contrast, it follows from results in\ncommunication complexity that any randomized algorithm even just to decide\nwhether the graph is connected or not must make at least $\\Omega(n/\\log(n))$\nmany cut queries. We further show that with $O(\\log(n)^8)$ many cut queries a\nquantum algorithm can with high probability output a spanning forest for $G$.\n  En route to proving these results, we design quantum algorithms for learning\na graph using cut queries. We show that a quantum algorithm can learn a graph\nwith maximum degree $d$ after $O(d \\log(n)^2)$ many cut queries, and can learn\na general graph with $O(\\sqrt{m} \\log(n)^{3/2})$ many cut queries.

The backreaction of the heliospheric state\nis to make the coronal mass ejections (CMEs) appear physically bigger than in\nSC 23, but their magnetic content has been diluted resulting in a lower\ngeoeffectiveness. The heliospheric magnetic field is also lower in SC 24,\nleading to the dearth of high-energy solar energetic particle (SEP) events.\nThese space weather events closely follow fast and wide (FW) CMEs. All but FW\nCMEs are higher in number in SC 24. The CME rate vs. sunspot number (SSN)\ncorrelation is high in both cycles but the rate increases faster in SC 24. We\nrevisit the study of limb CMEs (those with source regions within 30 degrees\nfrom the limb) previously studied over partial cycles.

To efficiently\naccess data, they apply sophisticated optimizations. Incorrect optimizations\ncan result in logic bugs, which cause a query to compute an incorrect result\nset. We propose Non-Optimizing Reference Engine Construction (NoREC), a\nfully-automatic approach to detect optimization bugs in DBMS. Conceptually,\nthis approach aims to evaluate a query by an optimizing and a non-optimizing\nversion of a DBMS, to then detect differences in their returned result set,\nwhich would indicate a bug in the DBMS. Obtaining a non-optimizing version of a\nDBMS is challenging, because DBMS typically provide limited control over\noptimizations. Our core insight is that a given, potentially randomly-generated\noptimized query can be rewritten to one that the DBMS cannot optimize.\nEvaluating this unoptimized query effectively corresponds to a non-optimizing\nreference engine executing the original query. We evaluated NoREC in an\nextensive testing campaign on four widely-used DBMS, namely PostgreSQL,\nMariaDB, SQLite, and CockroachDB. We found 159 previously unknown bugs in the\nlatest versions of these systems, 141 of which have been fixed by the\ndevelopers.

This paper concentrates on an attractive application which aims to\npredict the object-tag links in the KG for better tag recommendation and object\nexplanation. When predicting the object-tag links, both the first-order and\nhigh-order proximities between entities in the KG propagate essential\nsimilarity information for better prediction. Most existing methods focus on\npreserving the first-order proximity between entities in the KG. However, they\ncannot capture the high-order proximities in an explicit way, and the adopted\nmargin-based criterion cannot measure the first-order proximity on the global\nstructure accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Dual\nGraph Embedding (DGE) that models both the first-order and high-order\nproximities in the KG via an auto-encoding architecture to facilitate better\nobject-tag relation inference. Here the dual graphs contain an object graph and\na tag graph that explicitly depict the high-order object-object and tag-tag\nproximities in the KG. The dual graph encoder in DGE then encodes these\nhigh-order proximities in the dual graphs into entity embeddings. The decoder\nformulates a skip-gram objective that maximizes the first-order proximity\nbetween observed object-tag pairs over the global proximity structure. With the\nsupervision of the decoder, the embeddings derived by the encoder will be\nrefined to capture both the first-order and high-order proximities in the KG\nfor better link prediction. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that DGE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 12:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-17"}

Exploring relational learning\non multiple bipartite graphs has been receiving attention because of its\npopular applications such as recommendations. How to make efficient relation\ninference with few observed links is the main problem on multiple bipartite\ngraphs. Most existing approaches attempt to solve the sparsity problem via\nlearning shared representations to integrate knowledge from multi-source data\nfor shared entities. However, they merely model the correlations from one\naspect (e.g. distribution, representation), and cannot impose sufficient\nconstraints on different relations of the shared entities.

For the analysis we adopt the notion of energetic evolution, based on\nglobal minimisation of the involved energy. Due to the presence of the cohesive\nzone, as already emerged in literature, compactness issues lead to the\nintroduction of a fictitious variable replacing the physical one which\nrepresents the maximal opening of the interface displacement discontinuity\nreached during the evolution.

Several models of Jupiter's\nstructure that fit the probe's data suggest that the planet has a diluted core,\nwith a total heavy-element mass ranging from ten to a few tens of Earth masses\n(~5-15 % of the Jovian mass), and that heavy elements (elements other than H\nand He) are distributed within a region extending to nearly half of Jupiter's\nradius. Planet-formation models indicate that most heavy elements are accreted\nduring the early stages of a planet's formation to create a relatively compact\ncore and that almost no solids are accreted during subsequent runaway gas\naccretion. Jupiter's diluted core, combined with its possible high\nheavy-element enrichment, thus challenges standard planet-formation theory. A\npossible explanation is erosion of the initially compact heavy-element core,\nbut the efficiency of such erosion is uncertain and depends on both the\nimmiscibility of heavy materials in metallic hydrogen and on convective mixing\nas the planet evolves. Another mechanism that can explain this structure is\nplanetesimal enrichment and vaporization during the formation process, although\nrelevant models typically cannot produce an extended diluted core. Here we show\nthat a sufficiently energetic head-on collision (giant impact) between a large\nplanetary embryo and the proto-Jupiter could have shattered its primordial\ncompact core and mixed the heavy elements with the inner envelope. Models of\nsuch a scenario lead to an internal structure that is consistent with a diluted\ncore, persisting over billions of years.

The method consists in jointly\napplying Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition and conditioned structure functions to\nanalyzing turbulent velocity fields.

To emphasize the influence of combustion-induced thermal\nexpansion on turbulent flow of unburned mixture upstream of a premixed flame,\nthe focus of analysis is placed on structure functions conditioned to the\nunburned mixture in both points. Two decomposition techniques, i.e. (i) a\nwidely used orthogonal Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition and (ii) a recently\nintroduced natural Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, are probed, with results\nobtained using them being similar in the largest part of the computational\ndomain with the exception of narrow zones near the inlet and outlet boundaries.\nComputed results indicate that combustion-induced thermal expansion can\nsignificantly change turbulent flow of unburned mixture upstream of a premixed\nflame by generating anisotropic potential velocity fluctuations whose spatial\nstructure differ substantially from spatial structure of the incoming\nturbulence. The magnitude of such potential velocity fluctuations is greater\nthan the magnitude of the solenoidal velocity fluctuations in the largest part\nof the mean flame brush in the case of the high density ratio.

Thus, ad-hoc measures are employed to estimate the\nrepetitiveness of strings, e.g., the size $z$ of the Lempel-Ziv parse or the\nnumber $r$ of equal-letter runs of the Burrows-Wheeler transform. A more recent\none is the size $\\gamma$ of a smallest string attractor. Unfortunately, Kempa\nand Prezza [STOC 2018] showed that computing $\\gamma$ is NP-hard. Kociumaka et\nal. [LATIN 2020] considered a new measure that is based on the function $S_T$\ncounting the cardinalities of the sets of substrings of each length of $T$,\nalso known as the substring complexity. This new measure is defined as $\\delta=\n\\sup\\{S_T(k)/k, k\\geq 1\\}$ and lower bounds all the measures previously\nconsidered. In particular, $\\delta\\leq \\gamma$ always holds and $\\delta$ can be\ncomputed in $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time using $\\Omega(n)$ working space.

This paper presents a deep learning-based spoofing attack to\ngenerate synthetic wireless signals that cannot be statistically distinguished\nfrom intended transmissions. The adversary is modeled as a pair of a\ntransmitter and a receiver that build the generator and discriminator of the\ngenerative adversarial network, respectively, by playing a minimax game over\nthe air. The adversary transmitter trains a deep neural network to generate the\nbest spoofing signals and fool the best defense trained as another deep neural\nnetwork at the adversary receiver.

Signals are spoofed by jointly\ncapturing waveform, channel, and radio hardware effects that are inherent to\nwireless signals under attack.

The adversary transmitter can increase the\nspoofing attack success by using multiple antennas, while the attack success\ndecreases when the defender receiver uses multiple antennas.

This result implies a\nsharp improvement to a similar inequality proved by\nLinial-Samorodnitsky-Wigderson in 2000, which was crucial to the analysis of\ntheir permanent approximation algorithm. Such inequalities have played an\nimportant role in the recent work on operator scaling and its generalizations\nand applications, and in fact we use our bound to construct a new scaling\nalgorithm for real stable polynomials.\n  In addition, we give a strong improvement on previous lower bounds of the\ncapacity of a non-homogeneous real stable polynomial, depending only on the\nvalue of its gradient at $x = 1$. Crucially, this new bound is independent of\nthe degree of the polynomial, and has singly exponential dependence on the\nnumber of variables. This compares favorably to the bounds used recently in the\nfantastic work of Karlin-Klein-Oveis Gharan to give an improved approximation\nfactor for metric TSP, where this dependence is doubly exponential. Such bounds\nwere conjectured to exist by the authors, and thus our new bound should imply\nfurther improvement to the approximation factor for metric TSP.\n  The new technique we develop to prove this bound is productization, which\nsays that any real stable polynomial can be approximated at any point in the\npositive orthant by a product of linear forms. Beyond the results of this\npaper, our main hope is that this new technique will allow us to avoid\n\"frightening technicalities\", in the words of Laurent and Schrijver, that often\naccompany combinatorial lower bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 15:08:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 19:27:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 16:30:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 01:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-23"}

Addressing to this concern, various approaches\nhave been proposed to formally verify the robustness of DNNs. Most of these\napproaches reduce the verification problem to optimization problems of\nsearching an adversarial example for a given input so that it is not correctly\nclassified to the original label. However, they are limited in accuracy and\nscalability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that can accelerate the\nrobustness verification techniques by guiding the verification with target\nlabels. The key insight of our approach is that the robustness verification\nproblem of DNNs can be solved by verifying sub-problems of DNNs, one per target\nlabel. Fixing the target label during verification can drastically reduce the\nsearch space and thus improve the efficiency. We also propose an approach by\nleveraging symbolic interval propagation and linear relaxation techniques to\nsort the target labels in terms of chances that adversarial examples exist.\nThis often allows us to quickly falsify the robustness of DNNs and the\nverification for remaining target labels could be avoided. Our approach is\northogonal to, and can be integrated with, many existing verification\ntechniques. For evaluation purposes, we integrate it with three recent\npromising DNN verification tools, i.e., MipVerify, DeepZ, and Neurify.\nExperimental results show that our approach can significantly improve these\ntools by 36X speedup when the perturbation distance is set in a reasonable\nrange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 00:51:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 00:04:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

Differently from the non-adaptive influence maximization problem,\nwhere all the seeds must be selected beforehand, here nodes are selected\nsequentially one by one, and the decision on the $i$th seed is based on the\nobserved cascade produced by the first $i-1$ seeds. We focus on the myopic\nfeedback model, in which we can only observe which neighbors of previously\nselected seeds have been influenced and on the independent cascade model, where\neach edge is associated with an independent probability of diffusing influence.\nPrevious works showed that the adaptivity gap is at most $4$, which implies\nthat the non-adaptive greedy algorithm guarantees an approximation factor of\n$\\frac{1}{4}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{e}\\right)$ for the adaptive problem.

It is found that many of these newly-found\nstable periodic orbits have the mass ratios close to those of the hierarchical\ntriple systems that have been measured by the astronomical observation. It\nimplies that these stable periodic orbits of the non-hierarchical triple system\nwith distinctly unequal masses can be quite possibly observed in practice.

On the basis of it, a sample set is constructed. Second, each of these\nfour ML algorithms learns from the sample set to obtain the corresponding\noptimal classified results, respectively. The experimental results show that:\nRF performs better than other three algorithms, and the former algorithm\nclassifies whether an individual has CS with an accuracy of 95.7% (=90/94).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 04:56:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 11:49:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 23:38:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 12:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

In this paper, we make the novel contribution of\nproposing and evaluating a design for the early processing layers in the deep\nCNN for multichannel sEMG. Specifically, we propose a novel temporal-to-spatial\n(TtS) CNN architecture, where the first layer performs convolution separately\non each sEMG channel to extract temporal features. This is motivated by the\nidea that sEMG signals in each channel are mediated by one or a small subset of\nmuscles, whose temporal activation patterns are associated with the signature\nfeatures of a gesture. The temporal layer captures these signature features for\neach channel separately, which are then spatially mixed in successive layers to\nrecognise a specific gesture. A practical advantage is that this approach also\nmakes the CNN simple to design for different sample rates. We use NinaPro\ndatabase 1 (27 subjects and 52 movements + rest), sampled at 100 Hz, and\ndatabase 2 (40 subjects and 40 movements + rest), sampled at 2 kHz, to evaluate\nour proposed CNN design.

One criticism sometimes\nlobbed at these interventions invokes the spirit of Malthus. The good done, the\ncharge goes, is offset by the harm of spreading the earth's limited resources\nmore thinly: more people, and more misery per person. To the extent this holds,\nthe net benefit of savings lives is lower than it appears at first. On the\nother hand, if lower mortality, especially in childhood, leads families to have\nfewer children, life-saving interventions could reduce population. This\ndocument critically reviews the evidence. It finds that the impact of\nlife-saving interventions on fertility and population growth varies by context,\nand is rarely greater than 1:1. In places where lifetime births/woman has been\nconverging to 2 or lower, saving one child's life should lead parents to avert\na birth they would otherwise have. The impact of mortality drops on fertility\nwill be nearly 1:1, so population growth will hardly change. In the\nincreasingly exceptional locales where couples appear not to limit fertility\nmuch, such as Niger and Mali, the impact of saving a life on total births will\nbe smaller, and may come about mainly through the biological channel of\nlactational amenorrhea. Here, mortality-drop-fertility-drop ratios of 1:0.5 and\n1:0.33 appear more plausible. But in the long-term, it would be surprising if\nthese few countries do not join the rest of the world in the transition to\nlower and more intentionally controlled fertility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 00:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-23"}
