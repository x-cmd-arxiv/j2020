The main design\nchallenge here is setting optimal system parameters such as number of serving\nbeams, beam directions and sizes, and transmit power. This paper aims at\ndeveloping a tool, multibeam satellite traffic simulator, that helps addressing\nthese fundamental challenges, and more importantly, provides an understanding\nto the spatial-temporal traffic pattern of satellite networks in large-scale\nenvironments. Specifically, traffic demand distribution is investigated by\nprocessing credible datasets included three major input categories of\ninformation: (i) population distribution for broadband Fixed Satellite Services\n(FSS), (ii) aeronautical satellite communications, and (iii) vessel\ndistribution for maritime services. This traffic simulator combines this\nthree-dimensional information in addition to time, locations of terminals, and\ntraffic demand. Moreover, realistic satellite beam patterns have been\nconsidered in this work, and thus, an algorithm has been proposed to delimit\nthe coverage boundaries of each satellite beam, and then compute the\nheterogeneous traffic demand at the footprint of each beam. Furthermore,\nanother algorithm has been developed to capture the inherent attributes of\nsatellite channels and the effects of multibeam interference. Data-driven\nmodeling for satellite traffic is crucial nowadays to design innovative\ncommunication systems, e.g., precoding and beam hopping, and to devise\nefficient resource management algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

For a general spectral sparsification problem,\ne.g., positive subset selection problem from a set of $m$ vectors from\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$, we propose a nonnegative UGA algorithm which needs $O(mn^2+\nn^3/\\epsilon^2)$ time to find a\n$\\frac{1+\\epsilon/\\beta}{1-\\epsilon/\\beta}$-spectral sparsifier with positive\ncoefficients with sparsity $\\le\\lceil\\frac{n}{\\epsilon^2}\\rceil$, where $\\beta$\nis the ratio between the smallest length and largest length of the vectors.

Traditional control systems employ\nresilient/fault-tolerant controllers that counter these attacks by correcting\nthe system via error observations. However, in some applications, a resilient\ncontroller may not be sufficient to avoid a catastrophic failure. Ideally, a\nrobust approach is more useful in these scenarios where a system is inherently\nrobust (by design) to adversarial attacks. While robust control has a long\nhistory of development, robust ML is an emerging research area that has already\ndemonstrated its relevance and urgency. However, the majority of robust ML\nresearch has focused on perception tasks and not on decision and control tasks,\nalthough the ML (specifically RL) models used for control applications are\nequally vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that a\nwell-performing DRL agent that is initially susceptible to action space\nperturbations (e.g. actuator attacks) can be robustified against similar\nperturbations through adversarial training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:50:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Nevertheless, the\npowerful expressivity of neural networks comes to naught if one is unable to\neffectively train (choose) the parameters defining the network. In general,\nneural networks are trained by gradient descent type optimization methods, or a\nstochastic variant thereof. In practice, such methods result in the loss\nfunction decreases rapidly at the beginning of training but then, after a\nrelatively small number of steps, significantly slow down. The loss may even\nappear to stagnate over the period of a large number of epochs, only to then\nsuddenly start to decrease fast again for no apparent reason. This so-called\nplateau phenomenon manifests itself in many learning tasks.\n  The present work aims to identify and quantify the root causes of plateau\nphenomenon. No assumptions are made on the number of neurons relative to the\nnumber of training data, and our results hold for both the lazy and adaptive\nregimes. The main findings are: plateaux correspond to periods during which\nactivation patterns remain constant, where activation pattern refers to the\nnumber of data points that activate a given neuron; quantification of\nconvergence of the gradient flow dynamics; and, characterization of stationary\npoints in terms solutions of local least squares regression lines over subsets\nof the training data. Based on these conclusions, we propose a new iterative\ntraining method, the Active Neuron Least Squares (ANLS), characterised by the\nexplicit adjustment of the activation pattern at each step, which is designed\nto enable a quick exit from a plateau.

In the standard\nsecretary problem, a sequence of arbitrary awards arrive online, in a random\norder, and a single decision maker makes an immediate and irrevocable decision\nwhether to accept each award upon its arrival. The requirement to make\nimmediate decisions arises in many cases due to an implicit assumption\nregarding competition. Namely, if the decision maker does not take the offered\naward immediately, it will be taken by someone else. The novelty in this paper\nis in introducing a multi-agent model in which the competition is endogenous.\nIn our model, multiple agents compete over the arriving awards, but the\ndecisions need not be immediate; instead, agents may select previous awards as\nlong as they are available (i.e., not taken by another agent). If an award is\nselected by multiple agents, ties are broken either randomly or according to a\nglobal ranking. This induces a multi-agent game in which the time of selection\nis not enforced by the rules of the games, rather it is an important component\nof the agent's strategy. We study the structure and performance of equilibria\nin this game. For random tie breaking, we characterize the equilibria of the\ngame, and show that the expected social welfare in equilibrium is nearly\noptimal, despite competition among the agents. For ranked tie breaking, we give\na full characterization of equilibria in the 3-agent game, and show that as the\nnumber of agents grows, the winning probability of every agent under\nnon-immediate selections approaches her winning probability under immediate\nselections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 17:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

An important example in radiology is generalizing from non-contrast\nCT to contrast enhanced CTs. Contrast enhanced CT scans at different phases are\nused to enhance certain pathologies or organs. Many existing cross-domain\nimage-to-image translation models have been shown to improve cross-domain\nsegmentation of large organs.

We compare our image translation framework to several\nstate-of-the-art methods on cross-domain image translation and show our model\ndoes a better job preserving fine structures. The superior performance of our\nmodel is verified by performing two tasks with the translated images -\ndetection and segmentation of aortic plaques and pancreas segmentation.

Thus, they often simply enlarge the input texture, rather\nthan perform reasonable synthesis. As a compromise, many recent methods\nsacrifice generalizability by training and testing on the same single (or fixed\nset of) texture image(s), resulting in huge re-training time costs for unseen\nimages. In this work, based on the discovery that the assembling/stitching\noperation in traditional texture synthesis is analogous to a transposed\nconvolution operation, we propose a novel way of using transposed convolution\noperation. Specifically, we directly treat the whole encoded feature map of the\ninput texture as transposed convolution filters and the features'\nself-similarity map, which captures the auto-correlation information, as input\nto the transposed convolution. Such a design allows our framework, once\ntrained, to be generalizable to perform synthesis of unseen textures with a\nsingle forward pass in nearly real-time. Our method achieves state-of-the-art\ntexture synthesis quality based on various metrics. While self-similarity helps\npreserve the input textures' regular structural patterns, our framework can\nalso take random noise maps for irregular input textures instead of\nself-similarity maps as transposed convolution inputs. It allows to get more\ndiverse results as well as generate arbitrarily large texture outputs by\ndirectly sampling large noise maps in a single pass as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 17:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

In\nbinary systems, they also shape the stars' evolution by modifying the orbit. In\nthis paper, we use hydrodynamic simulations to study the emergence of\nnearly-isothermal winds from identical-twin binaries. We vary the degree to\nwhich model stars fill their Roche lobes and the temperature of the wind.\nInitialized at rest on the stellar surfaces, winds accelerate away from the\nbinary components through a sonic surface to supersonic outward velocities. In\ncases where the binary fills its Roche lobe, a shared subsonic region surrounds\nboth components. We find that mass loss rates from close twin-star binaries are\nenhanced relative to the expectation from two single-object winds. This binary\nenhancement is best modeled as a function of the ratio of wind velocity to\norbital velocity. Similarly, we find that the specific angular momentum with\nwhich winds emerge can vary between that of the binary components and that of\nthe outer Lagrange points depending on the ratio of wind velocity to orbital\nvelocity. Given that mass and angular momentum loss can be modeled as simple\nfunctions of wind velocity, our results may be broadly applicable to the\nevolution of close, equal-mass binaries. One particularly important potential\napplication is to massive, close binaries which may be progenitors of binary\nblack hole mergers through the chemically-homogeneous evolution channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

We used the parallaxes and proper motions of YSOs\nfrom Gaia DR2 as a proxy for gas distance and proper motion, and the gas radial\nvelocities from archival CO data, to compute the space motions of the different\nstar-forming clouds in the complex, including subregions in Orion A, Orion B,\nand two outlying cometary clouds. From the analysis of the clouds' orbits in\nspace and time, we find that they were closest about 6 Myr ago and are moving\nradially away from roughly the same region in space. This coherent 100-pc scale\nradial motion supports a scenario where the entire complex is reacting to a\nmajor feedback event, which we name the Orion-BB (big blast) event. This event,\nwhich we tentatively associate with the recently discovered Orion X stellar\npopulation, shaped the distribution and kinematics of the gas we observe today,\nalthough it is unlikely to have been the sole major feedback event in the\nregion. We argue that the dynamics of most of the YSOs carry the memory of the\nfeedback-driven star formation history in Orion and that the majority of the\nyoung stars in this complex are a product of large-scale triggering, which can\nraise the star formation rate by at least an order of magnitude, as for the\nhead of Orion A (the Integral Shape Filament).

However, in solid\nstate materials other spin interactions are present, and among such additional\ninteractions, the off-diagonal symmetric Gamma interaction, another type of\nbond-dependent term, has been particularly challenging to fully understand. A\nminimal Kitaev-Gamma (KG) model has been investigated by various numerical\ntechniques under a magnetic field, but definite conclusions about field-induced\nspin liquids remain elusive and one reason may lie in the limited sizes of the\ntwo-dimensional geometry it is possible to access numerically. We therefore\nfocus on the KG model defined on a two-leg ladder which is much more amenable\nto a complete study, and determine the entire phase diagram in the presence of\na magnetic field along [111]-direction. Due to the competition between the\ninteractions and the field, an extremely rich phase diagram emerges with\nfifteen distinct phases. Focusing near the antiferromagnetic Kitaev region, we\nidentify nine different phases solely within this region: several\nincommensurate magnetically ordered phases, spin nematic, and two chiral phases\nwith enhanced entanglement. Of particular interest is a highly entangled phase\nwith staggered chirality with zero-net flux occurring at intermediate field,\nwhich along with its companion phases outline a heart-shaped region of high\nentanglement, the heart of entanglement. We compare our results for the ladder\nwith a C3 symmetric cluster of the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, and offer\ninsights into possible spin liquids in the two-dimensional limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

This leads to a hybrid configuration with an\ninner magnetized disk, driven by angular momentum losses to an MHD outflow,\nsharply transiting to an outer weakly-magnetized turbulent disk, where the\neruptions are triggered. The dynamical impact is equivalent to truncating a\nviscous disk so that it does not extend down to the compact object, with the\ntruncation radius dependent on the magnetic flux and evolving as\n$\\dot{M}^{-2/3}$. Models of DNe and LMXBs lightcurves typically require the\nouter, viscous disk to be truncated in order to match observations. There is no\ngeneric explanation for this truncation. We propose that it is a natural\noutcome of the presence of large-scale magnetic fields in both DNe and LMXBs,\nthe magnetic flux accumulating towards the center to produce a magnetized disk\nwith a fast accretion timescale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 18:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

For this purpose, the photometric data of 40 nearby ultra-cool dwarfs\nwere reanalysed in a self-consistent and fully automated manner starting from\nthe raw images. The pipeline developed specifically for this task generates\ndifferential light curves, removes non-planetary photometric features and\nstellar variability, and searches for transits. It identifies the transits of\nTRAPPIST-1b and TRAPPIST-1c without any human intervention. To test the\npipeline and the potential output of similar surveys, we injected planetary\ntransits into the light curves on a star-by-star basis and tested whether the\npipeline is able to detect them. The achieved photometric precision enables us\nto identify Earth-sized planets orbiting ultra-cool dwarfs as validated by the\ninjection tests.

We use this to merge hundreds\nof individual maps covering the 2008-2018 ACT observing seasons, resulting in\nby far the deepest ACT maps released so far. We also combine the maps with the\nfull Planck maps, resulting in maps that have the best features of both Planck\nand ACT: Planck's nearly white noise on intermediate and large angular scales\nand ACT's high-resolution and sensitivity on small angular scales. The maps\ncover over 18,000 square degrees, nearly half the full sky, at 100, 150 and 220\nGHz. They reveal 4,000 optically-confirmed clusters through the Sunyaev\nZel'dovich effect (SZ) and 18,500 point source candidates at $> 5\\sigma$, the\nlargest single collection of SZ clusters and millimeter wave sources to date.\nThe multi-frequency maps provide millimeter images of nearby galaxies and\nindividual Milky Way nebulae, and even clear detections of several nearby\nstars. Other anticipated uses of these maps include, for example, thermal SZ\nand kinematic SZ cluster stacking, CMB cluster lensing and galactic dust\nscience. The method itself has negligible bias. However, due to the preliminary\nnature of some of the component data sets, we caution that these maps should\nnot be used for precision cosmological analysis.

As a result, stars do not move in straight lines. This obvious\nfact severely complicates the kinetic theory of stellar systems because\nposition and velocity turn out to be poor coordinates with which to describe\nstellar orbits - instead, one must use angle-action variables. Moreover, the\nslow relaxation of star clusters and galaxies can be enhanced or suppressed by\ncollective interactions ('polarisation' effects) involving many stars\nsimultaneously. These collective effects are also present in plasmas; in that\ncase, they are accounted for by the Balescu-Lenard (BL) equation, which is a\nkinetic equation in velocity space. Recently several authors have shown how to\naccount for both inhomogeneity and collective effects in the kinetic theory of\nstellar systems by deriving an angle-action generalisation of the BL equation.\nUnfortunately their derivations are long and complicated, involving multiple\ncoordinate transforms, contour integrals in the complex plane, and so on. On\nthe other hand, Rostoker's superposition principle allows one to pretend that a\nlong-range interacting $N$-body system, such as a plasma or star cluster,\nconsists merely of uncorrelated particles that are 'dressed' by polarisation\nclouds. In this paper we use Rostoker's principle to provide a simple,\nintuitive derivation of the BL equation for stellar systems which is much\nshorter than others in the literature. It also allows us to straightforwardly\nconnect the BL picture of self-gravitating kinetics to the classical 'two-body\nrelaxation' theory of uncorrelated flybys pioneered by Chandrasekhar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 18:41:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 10:50:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

We further demonstrate a screening-induced transition from volume\n(transverse) to surface (longitudinal) photoemission with red detuning of the\nexcitation laser and determine the relative cross-sections of the two\nmechanisms via combined volume and surface multiphoton photoemission modelling.\nBased on these results, we are able to identify geometry- and material-specific\ncontributions to the photoemission cross-sections and offer general principles\nfor designing nanoplasmonic systems to control hot electron excitation and\nemission distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 19:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Since GRAND\ndoes not depend on the structure of the code, it can be used for any code\nencountered in contemporary communication standards or may even be used for\nrandom linear network coding. This property makes this new algorithm\nparticularly appealing. Instead of trying to decode the received vector, GRAND\nattempts to identify the noise that corrupted the codeword. To that end, GRAND\nrelies on the generation of test error patterns that are successively applied\nto the received vector.

Upscaling from one unique pore\nto a nanoporous membrane is not straightforward when we consider low aspect\nratio nanopore because of 3D entrance effects, which lead to interactions\nbetween the pores. Whereas these interactions have already been considered for\ndirect transport (hydrodynamic permeability of the membrane, ionic\nconductance), specific effects appear when coupled transports are considered.\nWe obtain here the expression of the electroosmotic mobility for a nanoporous\nmembrane including surface conduction, and by a numerical evaluation of our\nresults, we show that (i) it depends mainly of the distance between the pores\nand (ii) it is sublinear with the number of pores.

GHT thereby enables\nthe continuous interpolation between those three algorithms, which allows\nthresholding accuracy to be improved significantly. GHT also provides a\nclarifying interpretation of the common practice of coarsening a histogram's\nbin width during thresholding. We show that GHT outperforms or matches the\nperformance of all algorithms on a recent challenge for handwritten document\nimage binarization (including deep neural networks trained to produce per-pixel\nbinarizations), and can be implemented in a dozen lines of code or as a trivial\nmodification to Otsu's method or MET.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 20:55:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 04:27:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 03:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-20"}

In real-world surveillance\nenvironments, the actions in videos are captured at a wide range of\nresolutions. Most activities occur at a distance with a small resolution and\nrecognizing such activities is a challenging problem. In this work, we focus on\nrecognizing tiny actions in videos. We introduce a benchmark dataset,\nTinyVIRAT, which contains natural low-resolution activities. The actions in\nTinyVIRAT videos have multiple labels and they are extracted from surveillance\nvideos which makes them realistic and more challenging. We propose a novel\nmethod for recognizing tiny actions in videos which utilizes a progressive\ngenerative approach to improve the quality of low-resolution actions.

Previously, it was shown that maximizing mutual\ninformation between agent actuators and future states, known as the empowerment\nprinciple, enables unsupervised stabilization of dynamical systems at upright\npositions, which is a prototypical intrinsically motivated behavior for upright\nstanding and walking. This follows from the coincidence between the objective\nof stabilization and the objective of empowerment. Unfortunately, sample-based\nestimation of this kind of mutual information is challenging. Recently, various\nvariational lower bounds (VLBs) on empowerment have been proposed as solutions;\nhowever, they are often biased, unstable in training, and have high sample\ncomplexity. In this work, we propose an alternative solution based on a\ntrainable representation of a dynamical system as a Gaussian channel, which\nallows us to efficiently calculate an unbiased estimator of empowerment by\nconvex optimization. We demonstrate our solution for sample-based unsupervised\nstabilization on different dynamical control systems and show the advantages of\nour method by comparing it to the existing VLB approaches. Specifically, we\nshow that our method has a lower sample complexity, is more stable in training,\npossesses the essential properties of the empowerment function, and allows\nestimation of empowerment from images. Consequently, our method opens a path to\nwider and easier adoption of empowerment for various applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 21:10:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 May 2021 06:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

However,\nthey may result in sampling highly biased, redundant transitions since they\ncompute the sampling rate for each transition independently, without\nconsideration of its importance in relation to other transitions. In this\npaper, we aim to address the issue by proposing a new learning-based sampling\nmethod that can compute the relative importance of transition.

When the streaks reach high amplitudes, they\nindirectly amplify streamwise-elongated vortices through modulating small-scale\nfluctuations and pressure fields. These stronger vortices in turn stir the\nboundary layer more effectively and further intensify streaks via the lift-up\nmechanism. This nonlinear feedback loop increases the sensitivity of the\nboundary layer to the roughness level and yields dramatic variations among\ncases sharing the same Reynolds number with differing roughness height. Three\ndifferent local breakdown scenarios are observed depending on the amplitude of\nthe streaks: (i) two-dimensional wave instabilities in the regions with weak\nstreaks; (ii) inner shear-layer instabilities in the regions with\nmoderate-amplitude streaks; (iii) rapidly growing outer shear-layer\ninstabilities in the regions with highly elevated high-amplitude streaks. Inner\ninstabilities have the slowest growth rate among all transition paths, which\nconfirms the previous predictions on the stabilising role of moderate-amplitude\nstreaks (\\\"Onder & Liu, J.

In this\npaper, we use quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques to formulate a systematic\nprocedure for translating any sequence of $d$ quantum gates acting on $n$\nq-bits into a Boltzmann machine (BM) having $n+g(d)$ classical spins or p-bits\nwith two values \"0\" and \"1\", but with a complex energy function $E$.

Even larger problems should be accessible on dedicated Ising\nMachines.

For example, a straightforward\nprobabilistic implementation of Shor's algorithm with $n$ q-bits leads to an\n$S_{\\text{Total}} \\sim \\exp{(-n/2)}$, making the computation time for the\nprobabilistic Shor's algorithm scale exponentially as $2^{n/2}$ instead of the\npolynomial scaling expected for true quantum computers.

Such a high-purity\nsqueezed light can be realized with broad parameters and low pump power,\nproviding a robust approach to generate large-scale quantum resource.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 22:35:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

The emoji prediction task aims at predicting the proper set of emojis\nassociated with a piece of text.

In this paper, we extend the\nexisting setting of the emoji prediction task to include a richer set of emojis\nand to allow multi-label classification on the task.

Near a dozen star-forming galaxies have been detected in gamma-rays\nby the Fermi observatory in the last decade. A remarkable property of this\nsample is the quasi-linear relation between the gamma-ray luminosity and the\nstar formation rate, obtained assuming that the latter is well traced by the\ninfra-red luminosity of the galaxies. The non-linearity of this relation has\nnot been fully explained yet.\n  Aims. We aim at determining the biases derived from the use of the infrared\nluminosity as a proxy for the star formation rate, and shed light onto the more\nfundamental relation between the latter and the gamma-ray luminosity. We expect\nto quantify and explain some trends observed in this relation.\n  Methods. We compile from the literature a near-homogeneous set of distances,\nultraviolet, optical, infra-red, and gamma-ray fluxes for all known gamma-ray\nemitting star-forming galaxies. From these data we compute the infra-red and\ngamma-ray luminosities, and star formation rates. We determine the best-fitting\nrelation between the latter two, and describe the trend using simple,\npopulation-oriented models for cosmic-ray transport and cooling.\n  Results. We find that the gamma-ray luminosity-star formation rate relation\nobtained from infra-red luminosities is biased to shallower slopes. The actual\nrelation is steeper than previous estimates, having a power-law index of 1.35\n+- 0.05, in contrast to 1.23 +- 0.06.\n  Conclusions. The unbiased gamma-ray luminosity-star formation rate relation\ncan be explained at high star formation rates by assuming that the cosmic ray\ncooling region is kiloparsec-sized, and pervaded by mild to fast winds.\nCombined with previous results about the scaling of wind velocity with star\nformation rate, our work provides support to advection as the dominant cosmic\nray escape mechanism in low-star formation rate galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 01:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

The\nKIF aims to find a balance between the excellent merits of Gas-Kinetic Scheme\n(GKS) and the lower computational costs. The idea of KIF can be viewed as an\ninviscid-viscous splitting version of the gas-kinetic scheme, and Shu and\nOhwada have made the fundamental contribution. The combination of Totally\nThermalized Transport (TTT) scheme and Kinetic Flux Vector Splitting (KFVS)\nmethod are achieved in KIF. Using a coefficient which is related to time step\n$\\delta t$ and averaged collision time $\\tau$, KIF can adjust the weights of\nTTT and KFVS flux in the simulation adaptively. By doing the inviscid-viscous\nsplitting, KIF is very suitable and easy to integrate into the existing\nframework. The well understood FR framework is used widely for the advantages\nof robustness, economical costs and compactness. The combination of KIF and FR\nis originated by three motivations. The first purpose is to develop a high\norder method based on the gas kinetic theory. The second reason is to keep the\nadvantages of GKS. The last aim is that the designed method should be more\nefficient. In present work, we use the KIF method to replace the Riemann flux\nsolver applied in the interfaces of elements. The common solution at the\ninterface is computed according to the gas kinetic theory, which makes the\ncombination of KIF and FR scheme more reasonable and available. The accuracy\nand performance of present method are validated by several numerical cases.

In this paper, our goal is to\naddress the fundamental question about its sample complexity. We study arguably\nthe most basic MARL setting: two-player discounted zero-sum Markov games, given\nonly access to a generative model. We show that model-based MARL achieves a\nsample complexity of $\\tilde O(|S||A||B|(1-\\gamma)^{-3}\\epsilon^{-2})$ for\nfinding the Nash equilibrium (NE) value up to some $\\epsilon$ error, and the\n$\\epsilon$-NE policies with a smooth planning oracle, where $\\gamma$ is the\ndiscount factor, and $S,A,B$ denote the state space, and the action spaces for\nthe two agents. We further show that such a sample bound is minimax-optimal (up\nto logarithmic factors) if the algorithm is reward-agnostic, where the\nalgorithm queries state transition samples without reward knowledge, by\nestablishing a matching lower bound. This is in contrast to the usual\nreward-aware setting, with a\n$\\tilde\\Omega(|S|(|A|+|B|)(1-\\gamma)^{-3}\\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound, where\nthis model-based approach is near-optimal with only a gap on the $|A|,|B|$\ndependence. Our results not only demonstrate the sample-efficiency of this\nbasic model-based approach in MARL, but also elaborate on the fundamental\ntradeoff between its power (easily handling the more challenging\nreward-agnostic case) and limitation (less adaptive and suboptimal in\n$|A|,|B|$), particularly arises in the multi-agent context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 03:25:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2020 03:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

To deal\nwith this, they either drive to a park-and-ride location to take transit, use\ncarpooling, or drive directly to their destination to avoid inconvenience.\nRidesharing, an emerging mode of transportation, can solve the transit first\nmile/last mile problem. In this setup, a driver can drive a ride-seeker to a\ntransit station, from where the rider can take transit to her respective\ndestination. The problem requires solving a ridesharing matching problem with\nthe routing of riders in a multimodal transportation network. We develop a\ntransit-based ridesharing matching algorithm to solve this problem. The method\nleverages the schedule-based transit shortest path to generate feasible matches\nand then solves a matching optimization program to find an optimal match\nbetween riders and drivers. The proposed method not only assigns an optimal\ndriver to the rider but also assigns an optimal transit stop and a transit\nvehicle trip departing from that stop for the rest of the rider's itinerary. We\nalso introduce the application of space-time prism (STP) (the geographical area\nwhich can be reached by a traveler given the time constraints) in the context\nof ridesharing to reduce the computational time by reducing the network search.\nAn algorithm to solve this problem dynamically using a rolling horizon approach\nis also presented.

The noisy permutation channel model constitutes a standard discrete\nmemoryless channel (DMC) followed by an independent random permutation that\nreorders the output codeword of the DMC. While coding theoretic aspects of this\nmodel have been studied extensively, particularly in the context of reliable\ncommunication in network settings where packets undergo transpositions, and\nclosely related models of DNA based storage systems have also been analyzed\nrecently, we initiate an information theoretic study of this model by defining\nan appropriate notion of noisy permutation channel capacity. Specifically, on\nthe achievability front, we prove a lower bound on the noisy permutation\nchannel capacity of any DMC in terms of the rank of the stochastic matrix of\nthe DMC. On the converse front, we establish two upper bounds on the noisy\npermutation channel capacity of any DMC whose stochastic matrix is strictly\npositive (entry-wise). Together, these bounds yield coding theorems that\ncharacterize the noisy permutation channel capacities of every strictly\npositive and \"full rank\" DMC, and our achievability proof yields a conceptually\nsimple, computationally efficient, and capacity achieving coding scheme for\nsuch DMCs. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the relation between the output\ndegradation preorder over channels and noisy permutation channel capacity. In\nfact, the proof of one of our converse bounds exploits a degradation result\nthat constructs a symmetric channel for any DMC such that the DMC is a degraded\nversion of the symmetric channel. Finally, we illustrate some examples such as\nthe special cases of binary symmetric channels and (general) erasure channels.\nSomewhat surprisingly, our results suggest that noisy permutation channel\ncapacities are generally quite agnostic to the parameters that define the DMCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 06:50:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-16"}

For large engineering manipulators, the main challenge is to\naccurately recognize the posture of all arm segments. In classical sensing\nmethods, the accuracy of an inclinometer is easily affected by the elastic\ndeformation in the manipulator's arms. This results in big error accumulations\nwhen sensing the angle of joints between arms one by one. In addition, the\nsensing method based on machine vision is not suitable for such kind of outdoor\nworking situation yet.

The posture sensing problem is formulated as a\nNearest-Euclidean-Distance-Matrix (NEDM) model. The resulting approach is\nreferred to as EDM-based posture positioning approach (EPP) and it satisfies\nthe following guiding principles: (i) The posture of each arm segment on a\nmulti-joint manipulator must be estimated as accurately as possible; (ii) The\napproach must be computationally fast; (iii) The designed approach should not\nbe susceptible to obstructions. To further improve accuracy, we explore the\ninherent structure of manipulators, i.e., fixed-arm length. This is naturally\npresented as linear constraints in the NEDM model. For concrete pumps, a\ntypical multi-joint manipulator, the mechanical property that all arm segments\nalways lie in a 2D plane is used for dimension-reduction operation. Simulation\nand experimental results show that the proposed method provides efficient\nsolutions for posture sensing problem and can obtain preferable localization\nperformance with faster speed than applying the existing localization methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-16"}

To that end, machine\nlearning models are trained using historical data of each single asset leading\nto the development of asset-based models. To elevate machine learning models to\na higher level of learning capability, domain adaptation has opened the door\nfor extracting relevant patterns from several assets combined together. In this\nresearch we are focusing on translating the specific asset-based historical\ndata (source domain) into data corresponding to one reference asset (target\ndomain), leading to the creation of a multi-assets global dataset required for\ntraining domain invariant generic machine learning models. This research is\nconducted to apply domain adaptation to the ironmaking industry, and\nparticularly for the creation of a domain invariant dataset by gathering data\nfrom different blast furnaces. The blast furnace data is characterized by\nmultivariate time series. Domain adaptation for multivariate time series data\nhasn't been covered extensively in the literature.

When the two\noutput modes are observed by a single photon detector, the generated clicks can\nbe interpreted as ones and zeros - and a raw random bit stream is obtained.\nHere we implement such a random bit generator based on single photons from a\ndefect center in diamond.

However, it performs poorly on\ncontextless texts (e.g., random character sequences) which is unacceptable in\nmost of real application scenarios. In this paper, we first deeply investigate\nthe decoding process of the decoder. We empirically find that a representative\ncharacter-level sequence decoder utilizes not only context information but also\npositional information. Contextual information, which the existing approaches\nheavily rely on, causes the problem of attention drift. To suppress such\nside-effect, we propose a novel position enhancement branch, and dynamically\nfuse its outputs with those of the decoder attention module for scene text\nrecognition. Specifically, it contains a position aware module to enable the\nencoder to output feature vectors encoding their own spatial positions, and an\nattention module to estimate glimpses using the positional clue (i.e., the\ncurrent decoding time step) only. The dynamic fusion is conducted for more\nrobust feature via an element-wise gate mechanism. Theoretically, our proposed\nmethod, dubbed \\emph{RobustScanner}, decodes individual characters with dynamic\nratio between context and positional clues, and utilizes more positional ones\nwhen the decoding sequences with scarce context, and thus is robust and\npractical.

A subgraph $G'$ is a distance preserver with respect to $P$ if and only\nif every pair $(u, w) \\in P$ satisfies $dist_{G'} (u, w) = dist_{G}(u, w)$.

For this purpose, the flow dynamics are separated in\ndeterministic contributions representing the global mode and a stochastic\ncontribution representing the intrinsic turbulent forcing. Stochastic models\nare developed that account for the interaction between the two and that allow\ndetermining the dynamic properties of the flow from stationary data. The\ndeterministic contributions are modelled by an amplitude equation, which\ndescribes the oscillatory dynamics of the instability, and in a second approach\nby a mean-field model, which additionally captures the interaction between the\ninstability and the mean-flow corrections. The stochastic contributions are\nconsidered as coloured noise forcing, representing the spectral characteristics\nof the stochastic turbulent perturbations. The methodology is applied to a\nturbulent swirling jet with a dominant global mode. PIV measurements are\nconducted to ensure that the mode is the most dominant coherent structure and\nfurther pressure measurements provide long time series for the model\ncalibration. The supercritical Hopf bifurcation is identified from the linear\ngrowthrate of the global mode and the excellent agreement between measured and\nestimated statistics suggest that the model captures the relevant dynamics.\nThis work demonstrates that the sole observation of limit-cycle oscillations is\nnot sufficient to determine the stability of turbulent flows since the\nstochastic perturbations obscure the actual bifurcation point. However, the\nproposed separation of deterministic and stochastic contributions in the\ndynamical model allows identifying the flow sate from stationary measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 09:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

The physics\nof how these lasers interact with matter is highly nonlinear, relativistic, and\ncan involve lowest-order quantum effects. The current tool of choice for\nmodeling these interactions is the particle-in-cell (PIC) method. In strong\nfields, the motion of charged particles and their spin is affected by radiation\nreaction. Standard PIC codes usually use Boris or its variants to advance the\nparticles, which requires very small time steps in the strong-field regime to\nobtain accurate results. In addition, some problems require tracking the spin\nof particles, which creates a 9D particle phase space (x, u, s). Therefore,\nnumerical algorithms that enable high-fidelity modeling of the 9D phase space\nin the strong-field regime are desired.

Computing the width dates\nback to Dilworth's and Fulkerson's results in the 1950s, and is doable in\nquadratic time in the worst case. Since $k$ can be small in practical\napplications, research has also studied algorithms whose complexity is\nparameterized on $k$. Despite these efforts, it is still open whether there\nexists a linear-time $O(f(k)(|V| + |E|))$ parameterized algorithm computing the\nwidth. We answer this question affirmatively by presenting an $O(k^24^k|V| +\nk2^k|E|)$ time algorithm, based on a new notion of frontier antichains. As we\nprocess the vertices in a topological order, all frontier antichains can be\nmaintained with the help of several combinatorial properties, paying only\n$f(k)$ along the way. The fact that the width can be computed by a single\n$f(k)$-sweep of the DAG is a new surprising insight into this classical\nproblem.

Since closed formulae don't exist in general, practitioners often\nhave to resort to numerical schemes. Ladder methods are a popular class of\nalgorithms that rely on iterative constructions of geodesic parallelograms. And\nyet, the literature lacks a clear analysis of their convergence performance. In\nthis work, we give Taylor approximations of the elementary constructions of\nSchild's ladder and the pole ladder with respect to the Riemann curvature of\nthe underlying space. We then prove that these methods can be iterated to\nconverge with quadratic speed, even when geodesics are approximated by\nnumerical schemes. We also contribute a new link between Schild's ladder and\nthe Fanning Scheme which explains why the latter naturally converges only\nlinearly. The extra computational cost of ladder methods is thus easily\ncompensated by a drastic reduction of the number of steps needed to achieve the\nrequested accuracy. Illustrations on the 2-sphere, the space of symmetric\npositive definite matrices and the special Euclidean group show that the\ntheoretical errors we have established are measured with a high accuracy in\npractice. The special Euclidean group with an anisotropic left-invariant metric\nis of particular interest as it is a tractable example of a non-symmetric space\nin general , which reduces to a Riemannian symmetric space in a particular\ncase.

Operating an efficient quantum memory requires achieving critical\ncoupling between the spin ensemble and a suitable high-quality factor resonator\n-- this in turn requires a thorough understanding of the lineshapes for the\nrelevant spin resonance transitions, particularly considering the influence of\nthe resonator itself on line broadening. Here, we present pulsed electron spin\nresonance measurements of ensembles of bismuth donors in natural silicon, above\nwhich niobium superconducting resonators have been patterned. By studying spin\ntransitions across a range of frequencies and fields we identify distinct line\nbroadening mechanisms, and in particular those which can be suppressed by\noperating at magnetic-field-insensitive `clock transitions'. Given the donor\nconcentrations and resonator used here, we measure a cooperativity $C\\sim 0.2$\nand based on our findings we discuss a route to achieve unit cooperativity, as\nrequired for a quantum memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 10:28:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 12:52:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 09:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

Traditionally, cybersecurity experts assess and improve a company's\ncapabilities. However, many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) consider\nsuch services not to be affordable. We explore an alternative do-it-yourself\n(DIY) approach to bringing cybersecurity to SMBs. Our method and tool, CYSEC,\nimplements the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to guide and motivate SMBs to\nadopt good cybersecurity practices. CYSEC uses assessment questions and\nrecommendations to communicate cybersecurity knowledge to the end-user SMBs and\nencourage self-motivated change. In this paper, the operationalisation of SDT\nin CYSEC is presented and the results of a multi-case study shown that offer\ninsight into how SMBs adopted cybersecurity practices with CYSEC. Effective\nautomated cybersecurity communication depended on the SMB's hands-on skills,\ntools adaptedness, and the users' willingness to documenting confidential\ninformation. The SMBs wanted to learn in simple, incremental steps, allowing\nthem to understand what they do. An SMB's motivation to improve security\ndepended on the fitness of assessment questions and recommendations with the\nSMB's business model and IT infrastructure. The results of this study indicate\nthat automated counselling can help many SMBs in security adoption.

For the stochastic process of L\\'evy walks, a\nspecific range of optimal efficiencies was suggested under variation of search\nintrinsic and extrinsic environmental parameters. In this article, we study\nfractional Brownian motion as a search process, which under parameter variation\ngenerates all three basic types of diffusion, from sub- to normal to\nsuperdiffusion. In contrast to L\\'evy walks, fractional Brownian motion defines\na Gaussian stochastic process with power law memory yielding anti-persistent,\nrespectively persistent motion. Computer simulations of search by time-discrete\nfractional Brownian motion in a uniformly random distribution of targets show\nthat maximising search efficiencies sensitively depends on the definition of\nefficiency, the variation of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, the\nperception of targets, the type of targets, whether to detect only one or many\nof them, and the choice of boundary conditions. In our simulations we find that\ndifferent search scenarios favour different modes of motion for optimising\nsearch success, defying a universality across all search situations.

Two vertices of an undirected graph with real edge weights\nare cospectral iff the underlying weighted adjacency matrix $M$ fulfills\n$[M^k]_{u,u} = [M^k]_{v,v}$ for all non-negative integer $k$, and as a result\nany eigenvector $\\phi$ of $M$ has (or, in the presence of degeneracies, can be\nchosen to have) definite parity on $u$ and $v$. We here show that the powers of\na matrix with cospectral vertices induce further local relations on its\neigenvectors, and also can be used to design cospectrality preserving\nmodifications. To this end, we introduce the concept of \\emph{walk equivalence}\nof cospectral vertices with respect to \\emph{walk multiplets} which are special\nvertex subsets of a graph. Walk multiplets allow for systematic and flexible\nmodifications of a graph with a given cospectral pair while preserving this\ncospectrality. The set of modifications includes the addition and removal of\nboth vertices and edges, such that the underlying topology of the graph can be\naltered. In particular, we prove that any new vertex connected to a walk\nmultiplet by suitable connection weights becomes a so-called unrestricted\nsubstitution point (USP), meaning that any arbitrary graph may be connected to\nit without breaking cospectrality. Also, suitable interconnections between walk\nmultiplets within a graph are shown to preserve the associated cospectrality.\nImportantly, we demonstrate that the walk equivalence of cospectral vertices\n$u,v$ imposes a local structure on every eigenvector $\\phi$ obeying $\\phi_{u} =\n\\pm \\phi_{v} \\ne 0$ (in the case of degeneracies, a specific choice of the\neigenvector basis is needed).

The fundamental challenge in this\nlearning paradigm is catastrophic forgetting previously learned tasks when the\nmodel is optimized for a new task, especially when their data is not\naccessible. Current architectural-based methods aim at alleviating the\ncatastrophic forgetting problem but at the expense of expanding the capacity of\nthe model. Regularization-based methods maintain a fixed model capacity;\nhowever, previous studies showed the huge performance degradation of these\nmethods when the task identity is not available during inference (e.g. class\nincremental learning scenario). In this work, we propose a novel\narchitectural-based method referred as SpaceNet for class incremental learning\nscenario where we utilize the available fixed capacity of the model\nintelligently. SpaceNet trains sparse deep neural networks from scratch in an\nadaptive way that compresses the sparse connections of each task in a compact\nnumber of neurons. The adaptive training of the sparse connections results in\nsparse representations that reduce the interference between the tasks.\nExperimental results show the robustness of our proposed method against\ncatastrophic forgetting old tasks and the efficiency of SpaceNet in utilizing\nthe available capacity of the model, leaving space for more tasks to be\nlearned. In particular, when SpaceNet is tested on the well-known benchmarks\nfor CL: split MNIST, split Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10/100, it outperforms\nregularization-based methods by a big performance gap. Moreover, it achieves\nbetter performance than architectural-based methods without model expansion and\nachieved comparable results with rehearsal-based methods, while offering a huge\nmemory reduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 11:21:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 18:09:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 08:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

However,\nthe neural network architectures adopted by existing works suffer from poor\nscalability, generalization, and lack of interpretability. A long-standing\napproach to improve scalability and generalization is to incorporate the\nstructures of the target task into the neural network architecture. In this\npaper, we propose to apply graph neural networks (GNNs) to solve large-scale\nradio resource management problems, supported by effective neural network\narchitecture design and theoretical analysis. Specifically, we first\ndemonstrate that radio resource management problems can be formulated as graph\noptimization problems that enjoy a universal permutation equivariance property.\nWe then identify a class of neural networks, named \\emph{message passing graph\nneural networks} (MPGNNs). It is demonstrated that they not only satisfy the\npermutation equivariance property, but also can generalize to large-scale\nproblems while enjoying a high computational efficiency.

In a\nheterogeneous scenario, where control systems may tolerate only specific levels\nof sensor-to-controller latency, delay sensitivities need to be considered in\nthe design of control and network policies to achieve the desired performance\nguarantees. We propose a cross-layer optimal co-design of control, sampling and\nresource management policies for an NCS consisting of multiple stochastic\nlinear time-invariant systems which close their sensor-to-controller loops over\na shared network. Aligned with advanced communication technology, we assume\nthat the network offers a range of latency-varying transmission services for\ngiven prices. Local samplers decide either to pay higher cost to access a\nlow-latency channel, or to delay sending a state sample at a reduced price. A\nresource manager residing in the network data-link layer arbitrates channel\naccess and re-allocates resources if link capacities are exceeded. The\nperformance of the local closed-loop systems is measured by a combination of\nlinear-quadratic Gaussian cost and a suitable communication cost, and the\noverall objective is to minimize a defined social cost by all three policy\nmakers. We derive optimal control, sampling and resource allocation policies\nunder different cross-layer awareness models, including constant and\ntime-varying parameters, and show that higher awareness generally leads to\nperformance enhancement at the expense of higher computational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 11:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-16"}

The cross sections and polarization\nasymmetries, along with other asymmetries (forward-backward, azimuthal), are\nused to obtain simultaneous limits on the anomalous couplings using\nMarkov-Chain--Monte-Carlo (MCMC) method in each process. The polarization\nasymmetries can distinguish between $CP$-even and $CP$-odd couplings and help\nto put tighter constraints on the couplings. The polarization of the initial\n$e^-$ and $e^+$ beam, in case of $e^+e^-$ collider, are used to increase the\nsignal to background ratio, putting tighter constraints on the anomalous\ncouplings. The polarization asymmetries are instrumental in the measurement of\nanomalous couplings should a deviation from the SM be observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 12:16:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2023 20:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

This principle asserts that the complete state of the world\nsupervenes on the intrinsic properties of its most fundamental components and\ntheir spatiotemporal relations (the so-called Humean mosaic). There are\nwell-known arguments in the literature purporting to show that in quantum\nmechanics the Humean supervenience principle is violated, due to the existence\nof entangled states. Recently, however, arguments have been presented to the\neffect that the supervenience principle can be defended in Bohmian mechanics.\nThe key element of this strategy lies in the observation that according to\nBohmian mechanics the fundamental facts about particles are facts about their\nspatial locations, and moreover, for any proper subsystem of the world its\nstate may non-trivially depend on the spatial configuration of the rest of the\nuniverse. Thus quantum-mechanical states of subsystems do not represent their\nintrinsic properties but rather characterize their relations with the\nenvironment. In this paper we point out the worry that this Bohmian strategy\n--known as Bohumianism-- saves the letter but not the spirit of the Humean\ndoctrine of supervenience, since it prima facie violates another seemingly\nimportant Humean principle, which we call Strong Supervenience and whose denial\nimplies the existence of necessary connections among distinct individuals. We\nargue that the best defense for Bohumians is to question the fundamental\nexistence of complex physical systems and their states by treating any\nreference to them as a convenient description of the underlying collection of\nBohmian particles. We consider several pros and cons of this strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 12:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-16"}

The task is extremely challenging because of the vast areas of\nnon-texture regions in these scenes. These areas could overwhelm the\noptimization process in the commonly used unsupervised depth estimation\nframework proposed for outdoor environments. However, even when those regions\nare masked out, the performance is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we\nargue that the poor performance suffers from the non-discriminative point-based\nmatching. To this end, we propose P$^2$Net. We first extract points with large\nlocal gradients and adopt patches centered at each point as its representation.\nMultiview consistency loss is then defined over patches.

Furthermore,\nbecause those textureless regions in indoor scenes (e.g., wall, floor, roof,\n\\etc) usually correspond to planar regions, we propose to leverage superpixels\nas a plane prior.

We created synthetic transit light curves in seven different wavelength\nbands, from the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and fit them with\ntransit models parameterized by fixed deviating values of the impact parameter\n$b$. Our simulations show a wavelength-dependent offset that is more pronounced\nat the blue wavelengths where the limb-darkening effect is stronger.

Variations of $b$ by positive or negative\nvalues within its uncertainty interval introduce positive or negative slopes,\nthus the formation of an error envelope. The amplitude from blue optical to\nnear-infrared wavelength for a typical uncertainty on $b$ corresponds to one\natmospheric pressure scale height and more. This impact parameter degeneracy is\nconfirmed for different host types; K stars present prominently steeper slopes,\nwhile M stars indicate features at the blue wavelengths.

As MacKay and McCulloch proposed, spike-trains can be\nrepresented as bits sequences coming from Information Sources. Previously, we\nstudied relations between Information Transmission Rates (ITR) carried out by\nthe spikes, their correlations, and frequencies. Here, we concentrate on the\nproblem of how spikes fluctuations affect ITR. The Information Theory Method\ndeveloped by Shannon is applied. Information Sources are modeled as stationary\nstochastic processes. We assume such sources as two states Markov processes. As\na spike-trains' fluctuation measure, we consider the Standard Deviation SD,\nwhich, in fact, measures average fluctuation of spikes around the average spike\nfrequency. We found that character of ITR and signal fluctuations relation\nstrongly depends on parameter s which is a sum of transitions probabilities\nfrom no spike state to spike state and vice versa. It turned out that for\nsmaller s (s<1) the quotient ITR/SD has a maximum and can tend to zero\ndepending on transition probabilities. While for s large enough 1<s the ITR/SD\nis separated from 0 for each s. Similar behavior was observed when we replaced\nShannon entropy terms in Markov entropy formula by their approximation with\npolynomials. We also show that the ITR quotient by Variance behaves in a\ncompletely different way. We show that for large transition parameter s the\nInformation Transmission Rate by SD will never decrease to 0. Specifically, for\n1<s<1.7 the ITR will be always, independently on transition probabilities which\nform this s, above the level of fluctuations, i.e. we have SD<ITR.

Though functions of IFFLs\nare well studied, most previous computational analysis of IFFLs used ordinary\ndifferential equation (ODE) models where retroactivity, the effect downstream\nbinding sites exert on the dynamics of an upstream transcription factor (TF),\nwas not considered. It remains an open question to understand the behavior of\nIFFLs in contexts with high levels of retroactivity, e.g., in cells\ntransformed/transfected with high-copy plasmids, or in eukaryotic cells where a\nTF binds to numerous high-affinity binding sites in addition to one or more\nfunctional target sites. Here we study the behavior of IFFLs by simulating and\ncomparing ODE models with different levels of retroactivity. We find that\nincreasing retroactivity in an IFFL can increase, decrease, or keep the\nnetwork's response time and pulse amplitude constant. This suggests that\nincreasing retroactivity, traditionally considered as an impediment to\ndesigning robust synthetic systems, could be exploited to improve the\nperformance of IFFLs. We compare the behaviors of IFFLs to negative\nautoregulatory loops, another sign-sensitive response-accelerating network\nmotif, and find that increasing retroactivity in a negative autoregulated\ncircuit can only slow the response. The inability of a negative autoregulatory\nloop to flexibly handle retroactivity may have contributed to its lower\nabundance in eukaryotic relative to bacterial regulatory networks, a sharp\ncontrast to the significant abundance of IFFLs in both cell types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 15:09:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2020 13:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

Despite similar liquid\nproperties and impact conditions, differences in the splashing limit, the crown\nextension and the duration of the ascending phase are observed. These\ndifferences are related to the interfacial tension of the droplet/wall-film\nliquid pairs, which is linked to their miscibility and wettability. More\nprecisely, by calculating the crown surface energy, we show that the energy\nstored in the interface between droplet and wall-film (if any) is not\nnegligible and leads to smaller crown extensions and the need of more kinetic\nenergy to initiate splashing. Similarly, by calculating a modified capillary\ntime taking into account all surface and interfacial tensions, we show that the\ninterfacial tension acts as a non-negligible recoiling force, which reduces the\nduration of the ascending phase. The dynamics of this ascending phase is well\ncaptured for different wall-film thicknesses if accounting for the variations\nof the liquid masses in movement.

These learning theories place the learner as the sole\nconstructor of knowledge and emphasize the importance of the learner's inquiry\nprocess (Yilmaz, 2008). In constructivist inquiry-based science education, lab\nexperiences frequently play an important role in instruction as they provide\nstudents with opportunities to observe and make sense of the world around them\n(National Research Council, 2000), which raises the question of how\ninquiry-based science instruction can be translated to online environments.\nThere are several models for lab experiences in online science courses,\nincluding hands-on labs where students directly manipulate materials, remote\nlabs where students manipulate materials through a computer, and virtual labs\nand simulations where students work with simulated materials (Powell, et al.,\n2010). Hands-on labs play an important role, especially given constructivist\nviews that students construct meaning by making observations of the world\naround them, but there is evidence that simulated and virtual labs can play an\nimportant role and may even be better suited to some instructional goals than\nhands-on labs. Constructivist instruction also requires students to make their\nprocess visible and teachers to be responsive to student thinking, both of\nwhich are more challenging in online environments (Crippen, et al., 2013).\nHowever, with intentional design, these features can be incorporated into\nonline science courses (Jaber, et al., 2018; Jang, 2009).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 15:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-16"}

To address these issues, we propose a new\ntwo-level joint maximization idea to augment the generative network with an\ninference network during training which helps our model capture the several\nmodes of the data and generate features that better represent the underlying\ndata distribution. This provides strong cross-modal interaction for effective\ntransfer of knowledge between visual and semantic domains.

Our main results are the following.\n  1. We obtain near-optimal extractors for small-space sources in the\npolynomial error regime. For space $s$ sources over $n$ bits, our extractors\nrequire just $k\\geq s\\cdot$polylog$(n)$ entropy. This is an exponential\nimprovement over the previous best result, which required $k\\geq\ns^{1.1}\\cdot2^{\\log^{0.51} n}$ (Chattopadhyay and Li, STOC'16).\n  2.

Our main tool\nis a significantly improved extractor for adversarial sources, which is built\nvia a simple framework that makes novel use of a certain kind of\nleakage-resilient extractors (known as cylinder intersection extractors), by\ncombining them with a general type of extremal designs.

In previous works, the existence of antiskyrmions in\nMn$_{1.4}$PtSn was unambiguously demonstrated in real space by means of Lorentz\ntransmission electron microscopy on thin-plate samples ($\\sim$100~nm thick). In\nthe present study, we used small-angle neutron scattering and magnetic force\nmicroscopy to perform reciprocal- and real-space imaging of the magnetic\ntexture of bulk Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn single-crystals at different temperatures and in\napplied magnetic field. We found that the magnetic texture in the bulk differs\nsignificantly from that of thin-plate samples. Instead of spin helices or an\nantiskyrmion lattice, we observe an anisotropic fractal magnetic pattern of\nclosure domains in zero field above the spin-reorientation transition\ntemperature, which transforms into a set of bubble domains in high field. Below\nthe spin-reorientation transition temperature the strong in-plane anisotropy as\nwell as the fractal self-affinity in zero field is gradually lost, while the\nformation of bubble domains in high field remains robust.

We establish clinical drug effect vectors (i.e., drug-laboratory test\nassociations) by applying a continuous self-controlled case series model on a\nlongitudinal electronic health record data. We establish clinical disease sign\nvectors (i.e., disease-laboratory test associations) by applying a Wilcoxon\nrank sum test on a large-scale national survey data. Finally, we compute a\nrepurposing possibility score for each drug-disease pair by applying a dot\nproduct-based scoring function on clinical disease sign vectors and clinical\ndrug effect vectors.

However, these models require an\navalanche of expensive human labeled training data and many iterations to train\ntheir large number of parameters. This severely limits their scalability to the\nreal-world long-tail distributed categories, some of which are with a large\nnumber of instances, but with only a few manually annotated. Learning from such\nextremely limited labeled examples is known as Few-shot learning (FSL).\nDifferent to prior arts that leverage meta-learning or data augmentation\nstrategies to alleviate this extremely data-scarce problem, this paper presents\na statistical approach, dubbed Instance Credibility Inference (ICI) to exploit\nthe support of unlabeled instances for few-shot visual recognition. Typically,\nwe repurpose the self-taught learning paradigm to predict pseudo-labels of\nunlabeled instances with an initial classifier trained from the few shot and\nthen select the most confident ones to augment the training set to re-train the\nclassifier. This is achieved by constructing a (Generalized) Linear Model\n(LM/GLM) with incidental parameters to model the mapping from (un-)labeled\nfeatures to their (pseudo-)labels, in which the sparsity of the incidental\nparameters indicates the credibility of the corresponding pseudo-labeled\ninstance. We rank the credibility of pseudo-labeled instances along the\nregularization path of their corresponding incidental parameters, and the most\ntrustworthy pseudo-labeled examples are preserved as the augmented labeled\ninstances. Theoretically, under mild conditions of restricted eigenvalue,\nirrepresentability, and large error, our approach is guaranteed to collect all\nthe correctly-predicted instances from the noisy pseudo-labeled set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 03:38:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 05:08:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 08:38:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 03:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

MIR is becoming\nincreasingly helpful due to the wide use of digital imaging modalities and the\ngrowth of the medical image repositories. However, the popularity of various\ndigital imaging modalities in hospitals also poses several challenges to MIR.\nUsually, one image retrieval model is only trained to handle images from one\nmodality or one source. When there are needs to retrieve medical images from\nseveral sources or domains, multiple retrieval models need to be maintained,\nwhich is cost ineffective. In this paper, we study an important but unexplored\ntask: how to train one MIR model that is applicable to medical images from\nmultiple domains? Simply fusing the training data from multiple domains cannot\nsolve this problem because some domains become over-fit sooner when trained\ntogether using existing methods. Therefore, we propose to distill the knowledge\nin multiple specialist MIR models into a single multi-domain MIR model via\nuniversal embedding to solve this problem.

There are many effective techniques for\nreducing a network's computational footprint (quantisation, pruning, knowledge\ndistillation), but these lead to models whose computational cost is the same\nregardless of their input. Our human reaction times vary with the complexity of\nthe tasks we perform: easier tasks (e.g. telling apart dogs from boat) are\nexecuted much faster than harder ones (e.g. telling apart two similar looking\nbreeds of dogs). Driven by this observation, we develop a method for adaptive\nnetwork complexity by attaching a small classification layer, which we call\nSideNet, to a large pretrained network, which we call MainNet. Given an input,\nthe SideNet returns a classification if its confidence level, obtained via\nsoftmax, surpasses a user determined threshold, and only passes it along to the\nlarge MainNet for further processing if its confidence is too low. This allows\nus to flexibly trade off the network's performance with its computational cost.\nExperimental results show that simple single hidden layer perceptron SideNets\nadded onto pretrained ResNet and BERT MainNets allow for substantial decreases\nin compute with minimal drops in performance on image and text classification\ntasks.

For the resolution of the\nabove issue, recommender systems have emerged, which much help users go through\nthe process of decision-making and selecting relevant data. A recommender\nsystem predicts users behavior to be capable of detecting their interests and\nneeds, and it often uses the classification technique for this purpose. It may\nnot be sufficiently accurate to employ individual classification, where not all\ncases can be examined, which makes the method inappropriate to specific\nproblems. In this research, group classification and the ensemble learning\ntechnique were used for increasing prediction accuracy in recommender systems.\nAnother issue that is raised here concerns user analysis. Given the large size\nof the data and a large number of users, the process of user needs analysis and\nprediction (using a graph in most cases, representing the relations between\nusers and their selected items) is complicated and cumbersome in recommender\nsystems. Graph embedding was also proposed for resolution of this issue, where\nall or part of user behavior can be simulated through the generation of several\nvectors, resolving the problem of user behavior analysis to a large extent\nwhile maintaining high efficiency. In this research, individuals most similar\nto the target user were classified using ensemble learning, fuzzy rules, and\nthe decision tree, and relevant recommendations were then made to each user\nwith a heterogeneous knowledge graph and embedding vectors. This study was\nperformed on the MovieLens datasets, and the obtained results indicated the\nhigh efficiency of the presented method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 12:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

By considering the\nPoisson process parameter to be a mixed random variable, we capture the\nheterogeneity of foreseeable and unforeseeable risks. To illustrate, we\nestimate the weights for the two risk streams for a real dataset from a\nPortuguese insurer. To calculate the premium, we set the frequency and severity\nas distributions that belong to the linear exponential family. Under a Bayesian\nsetup , we show that when working with a finite mixture of conjugate priors,\nthe premium can be estimated by a mixture of posterior means, with updated\nparameters, depending on claim histories. We emphasise the riskiness of the\nunforeseeable trend, by choosing heavy-tailed distributions. After estimating\ndistribution parameters involved using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm,\nwe found that Bayesian premiums derived are more reactive to claim trends than\ntraditional ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 10:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

One\nof the most widely applied application of ML is facial recognition as it is\nrunning on millions of devices.

This discrepancy and\nthe lack of policy increases the uncertainty in the ML community about the\nfuture direction of facial recognition research and development. In this paper\nwe present results from a cross-national survey about public acceptance,\nprivacy, and discrimination of the use of facial recognition technology (FRT)\nin the public. This study provides insights about the opinion towards FRT from\nChina, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US), which can\nserve as input for policy makers and legal regulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 14:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

Based on the frustrated total internal\nreflection, a new apparatus is designed to measure the real contact area. For\nbrass samples with various surface topographies, the relation between normal\nload and real contact area is measured. Our experiments verify the linear\nrelationship between load and real contact area during loading process. More\nimportantly, the unloading process is firstly considered to distinguish the\ncontribution of elasticity and plasticity in contact of rough surfaces. It is\nfound that both elasticity and plasticity are involved throughout the\ncontinuous loading process, different from some present understanding and\nassumptions that they play at different loading stages. A quantitative\nparameter is proposed to indicate the contribution of plasticity. The present\nwork not only provides an experimental method to measure real contact area but\nfigure out how elastic and plastic deformation works in contact of rough\nsurfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}
