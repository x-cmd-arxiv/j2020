Various attacks and defenses are proposed to improve the\nadversarial robustness of modern-day deep learning architectures. While all\nthese approaches help improve the robustness, one promising direction for\nimproving adversarial robustness is unexplored, i.e., the complex topology of\nthe neural network architecture. In this work, we address the following\nquestion: Can the complex topology of a neural network give adversarial\nrobustness without any form of adversarial training?. We answer this\nempirically by experimenting with different hand-crafted and NAS-based\narchitectures. Our findings show that, for small-scale attacks, NAS-based\narchitectures are more robust for small-scale datasets and simple tasks than\nhand-crafted architectures. However, as the size of the dataset or the\ncomplexity of task increases, hand-crafted architectures are more robust than\nNAS-based architectures. Our work is the first large-scale study to understand\nadversarial robustness purely from an architectural perspective. Our study\nshows that random sampling in the search space of DARTS (a popular NAS method)\nwith simple ensembling can improve the robustness to PGD attack by nearly~12\\%.\nWe show that NAS, which is popular for achieving SoTA accuracy, can provide\nadversarial accuracy as a free add-on without any form of adversarial training.\nOur results show that leveraging the search space of NAS methods with methods\nlike ensembles can be an excellent way to achieve adversarial robustness\nwithout any form of adversarial training.

However, substances such as\nketamine and psychedelics have recently shown promising results and even\nreceived the grade of Breakthrough therapy for this indication. The accurate\nmechanisms of action underlying the efficacy of these substances are still to\nbe defined, but some similarities appear to be shared on different levels\nacross these substances. These include their structural, functional and\nbehavioral plasticity promoting abilities, as well as their capacity to promote\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor overexpression, which seems to constitute a\nkey element underlying their immediate and long-lasting action. From this\nobservation, the present review aims to examine and connect the pharmacological\npathways involved in these therapies to the neurobiological, cognitive and\npsychological responses that could be shared by both 5-HT2AR agonists and NMDA\nantagonists. It is suggested that BDNF overexpression resulting from mTOR\nactivation mediates both structural and functional plasticity, resulting in\nconnectivity changes among high-level cognitive networks such as the Default\nMode Network, finally leading to an increased and long-lasting psychological\nflexibility. Connecting these pieces of evidence could provide insights about\ntheir precise mechanisms of action and help researchers to develop biomarkers\nfor antidepressant response.

Yet, the dark side of\nsuch deepfakes, the malicious use of generated media, raises concerns about\nvisual misinformation. While existing research work on deepfake detection\ndemonstrates high accuracy, it is subject to advances in generation techniques\nand adversarial iterations on detection countermeasure techniques. Thus, we\nseek a proactive and sustainable solution on deepfake detection, that is\nagnostic to the evolution of generative models, by introducing artificial\nfingerprints into the models.\n  Our approach is simple and effective. We first embed artificial fingerprints\ninto training data, then validate a surprising discovery on the transferability\nof such fingerprints from training data to generative models, which in turn\nappears in the generated deepfakes.

However, cosmic variance generally limits\nthe statistical precision that can be achieved when constraining model\nparameters using these modes as measured in galaxy surveys, and moreover, these\nmodes are sometimes inaccessible due to observational systematics or\nforegrounds. For some applications, both limitations can be circumvented by\nreconstructing large-scale modes using the correlations they induce between\nsmaller-scale modes of an observed tracer (such as galaxy positions). In this\npaper, we further develop a formalism for this reconstruction, using a\nquadratic estimator similar to the one used for lensing of the cosmic microwave\nbackground.

The 3D treatments\npresented here differ somewhat from those used in the 2D CNN-PCA procedure.\nSpecifically, we introduce a new supervised-learning-based reconstruction loss,\nwhich is used in combination with style loss and hard data loss. The style loss\nuses features extracted from a 3D CNN pretrained for video classification. The\n3D CNN-PCA algorithm is applied for the generation of conditional 3D\nrealizations, defined on $60\\times60\\times40$ grids, for three geological\nscenarios (binary and bimodal channelized systems, and a three-facies\nchannel-levee-mud system). CNN-PCA realizations are shown to exhibit geological\nfeatures that are visually consistent with reference models generated using\nobject-based methods. Statistics of flow responses ($\\text{P}_{10}$,\n$\\text{P}_{50}$, $\\text{P}_{90}$ percentile results) for test sets of 3D\nCNN-PCA models are shown to be in consistent agreement with those from\nreference geomodels. Lastly, CNN-PCA is successfully applied for history\nmatching with ESMDA for the bimodal channelized system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 17:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Furthermore,\nsince a list of remotely sensed data sources is available, efficient\nexploitation of useful information from multi-source data for better vehicle\ndetection is challenging. To solve the above issues, a multi-source active\nfine-tuning vehicle detection (Ms-AFt) framework is proposed, which integrates\ntransfer learning, segmentation, and active classification into a unified\nframework for auto-labeling and detection.

While it is\nwell established that turbulence imprints a self-similar structure to the\nclouds, other processes, such as gravity and stellar feedback, can break their\nscale-free nature. The break of self-similarity can manifest itself in the\nexistence of characteristic scales that stand out from the underlying structure\ngenerated by turbulent motions.

In the standard paradigm of DM as weakly interacting\nmassive particle, subhalos are expected to shine in gamma rays and to provide a\nsignal detectable with current instruments, notably with the Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi~satellite. This is the main motivation behind\nsearches for DM signals towards dwarf spheroidal galaxies and unidentified\nFermi-LAT sources. A significant angular extension detected from unassociated\nsources located at relatively high latitudes is considered a \"smoking gun\"\nsignature for identifying DM subhalos. In the present work, we systematically\nexplore, by means of state-of-the-art models of cold DM halos in the Galaxy,\nthe detectability of extended subhalos with Fermi-LAT. We simulate a DM signal\nexploring different assumptions of subhalos distribution in the Galaxy and DM\nprofile, and reconstruct its flux through a realistic Fermi-LAT analysis\npipeline. In the most optimistic case, we show that a detection of extended DM\nsubhalos can be made for annihilation cross sections higher than $3 \\times\n10^{-26}$ cm$^3$/s (for a 100 GeV DM mass), still compatible with existing\ngamma-ray constraints, and that, in this case, the preference for extension of\nthe source (vs point-like hypothesis) is significant. For fainter signals,\ninstead, halos not only do not show significant extension, but they are not\neven detectable significantly as point-like sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

We\nfirst show that the behavior modification problem (BMP), i.e., the problem of\nsynthesizing an incentive sequence that induces a desired agent behavior at\nminimum total cost to the principal, is PSPACE-hard. Moreover, we show that by\nimposing certain restrictions on the incentive sequences available to the\nprincipal, one can obtain two NP-complete variants of the BMP. We also provide\na sufficient condition on the set of possible reward functions under which the\nBMP can be solved via linear programming. Finally, we propose two algorithms to\ncompute globally and locally optimal solutions to the NP-complete variants of\nthe BMP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 18:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

Non-rigid deformation makes it difficult\nto remove mismatches because no parametric transformation can be found. To\nsolve this problem, we first propose an algorithm based on the re-weighting and\n1-point RANSAC strategy (R1P-RNSC), which is a parametric method under a\nreasonable assumption that the non-rigid deformation can be approximately\nrepresented by multiple locally rigid transformations. R1P-RNSC is fast but\nsuffers from a drawback that the local smoothing information cannot be taken\ninto account. Then, we propose a non-parametric algorithm based on the\nexpectation maximization algorithm and dual quaternion (EMDQ) representation to\ngenerate the smooth deformation field. The two algorithms compensate for the\ndrawbacks of each other. Specifically, EMDQ needs good initial values provided\nby R1P-RNSC, and R1P-RNSC needs EMDQ for refinement. Experimental results with\nreal-world data demonstrate that the combination of the two algorithms has the\nbest accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods, which can handle up\nto 85% of outliers in real-time.

Quantum cryptography is a\ncapability that allows guaranteed security. Such capabilities can be\nimplemented in control of autonomous mechanical systems where, for instance, an\n'Alice Autonomous System' can control a 'Bob Autonomous System' for\napplications of automation and robotics. The applications of quantum\ntechnologies to mechanical systems, at a scale larger than the atomistic scale,\nfor control and automation, is a novel contribution of this paper. Notably, the\nfeedback control transfer function of an integrated classical dynamic system\nand a quantum state is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 19:04:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 01:47:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 05:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-27"}

There is strong evidence that comets\nincorporated pristine interstellar material as well as processed nebular\nmatter, providing insights into the composition and prevailing conditions over\nwide swaths of the solar nebula at the time of planet formation. Dynamically\nnew Oort cloud comets harbor primitive ices that have been stored thousands of\nastronomical units from the Sun and have suffered minimal thermal or radiative\nprocessing since their emplacement ~4.5 Gyr ago. Periodic, more dynamically\nevolved comets such as the Halley-type and Jupiter-family comets reveal the\neffects of lives spent over a range of heliocentric distances, including\nperihelion passages into the very inner solar system.

The coexistence of these noisy\nblock patterns limits the reliability of routinely-used community detection\nalgorithms, and requires extensions of model-based solutions to realistically\ncharacterize the node partition process, incorporate information from node\nattributes, and provide improved strategies for estimation and uncertainty\nquantification. To cover these gaps, we develop a new class of extended\nstochastic block models (ESBM) that infer groups of nodes having common\nconnectivity patterns via Gibbs-type priors on the partition process. This\nchoice encompasses many realistic priors for criminal networks, covering\nsolutions with fixed, random and infinite number of possible groups, and\nfacilitates the inclusion of node attributes in a principled manner. Among the\nnew alternatives in our class, we focus on the Gnedin process as a realistic\nprior that allows the number of groups to be finite, random and subject to a\nreinforcement process coherent with criminal networks. A collapsed Gibbs\nsampler is proposed for the whole ESBM class, and refined strategies for\nestimation, prediction, uncertainty quantification and model selection are\noutlined. The ESBM performance is illustrated in realistic simulations and in\nan application to an Italian mafia network, where we unveil key complex block\nstructures, mostly hidden from state-of-the-art alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 19:06:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 11:51:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 10:38:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 13:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

The prevailing reduced-order model of the leading EOF\n(EOF1) of zonal-mean zonal wind, called the annular mode, consists of an\neddy-mean flow interaction mechanism that results in a positive feedback of\nEOF1 onto itself. However, a few studies have pointed out that under some\ncircumstances in observations and GCMs, strong couplings exist between EOF1 and\nEOF2 at some lag times, resulting in decaying-oscillatory, or propagating,\nannular modes. Here, we introduce a reduced-order model for coupled EOF1 and\nEOF2 that accounts for potential cross-EOF eddy-zonal flow feedbacks. Using the\nanalytical solution of this model, we derive conditions for the existence of\nthe propagating regime based on the feedback strengths. Using this model, and\nidealized GCMs and stochastic prototypes, we show that cross-EOF feedbacks play\nan important role in controlling the persistence of the annular modes by\nsetting the frequency of the oscillation.

Unfortunately, we show\nthat this mechanism opens up a loophole that could be exploited to conduct a\nsingle-shard flooding attack, a type of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, to\noverwhelm a single shard that ends up reducing the performance of the system as\na whole.\n  To counter the single-shard flooding attack, we propose a countermeasure that\nessentially eliminates the loophole by rejecting the use of hash-based\ntransaction sharding. The countermeasure leverages the Trusted Execution\nEnvironment (TEE) to let blockchain's validators securely execute a transaction\nsharding algorithm with a negligible overhead. We provide a formal\nspecification for the countermeasure and analyze its security properties in the\nUniversal Composability (UC) framework. Finally, a proof-of-concept is\ndeveloped to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of our solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 19:58:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 15:39:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 19:07:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 14:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

However, an individual CMLR\ntends to give distinct M* for a same galaxy when it is applied in different\nbands. Examining five representative CMLRs from literature, we find that the\ndifference in M* predicted in different bands from optical to near-infrared by\na CMLR is 0.1-0.3 dex. Therefore, based on a sample of low surface brightness\ngalaxies (LSBG) that covers a wide range of color and luminosity, we\nre-calibrated each original CMLR in r, i, z, J, H, and K bands to give\ninternally self-consistent M* for a same galaxy. The g-r is the primary color\nindicator in the re-calibrated relations which show little dependenceon red (r\n- z) or near-infrared (J - K) colors.Additionally, the external discrepancies\nin the originally predicted stellar mass-to-light ratio (M*/L) by the five\nindependent CMLRs have been greatly reduced after re-calibration, especially in\nnear-infrared bands, implying that the near-infrared luminosities are more\nrobust to predict M*/L. For each CMLR, the re-calibrated relations provided in\nthis work could produce internally self-consistent M* from divergent\nphotometric bands, and are extensions of the re-calibrations from\nJohnson-Cousin filter system by the pioneering work of McGaugh & Schombert\n(2014) to SDSS filter system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 20:19:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

The Dagger architecture\nrelies on an FPGA-based NIC, closely coupled with the processor over a\nconfigurable memory interconnect, designed to offload and accelerate RPC\nstacks. Unlike the traditional cloud systems that use PCIe links as the NIC I/O\ninterface, we leverage memory-interconnected FPGAs as networking devices to\nprovide the efficiency, transparency, and programmability needed for\nfine-grained microservices. We show that this considerably improves CPU\nutilization and performance for cloud RPCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 20:43:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 08:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-14"}

However, the RT-PCR test which is\nconsidered to be a gold standard in the diagnosis of COVID-19 suffers from a\nhigh false-negative rate. Chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis has emerged as a\nfeasible and effective diagnostic technique towards this objective. In this\nwork, we propose the COVID-19 classification problem as a three-class\nclassification problem to distinguish between COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia\nclasses. We propose a three-stage framework, named COV-ELM. Stage one deals\nwith preprocessing and transformation while stage two deals with feature\nextraction.

As bigger and diverse datasets become\navailable, ELM can be quickly retrained as compared to its gradient-based\ncompetitor models. The proposed model achieved a macro average F1-score of 0.95\nand the overall sensitivity of ${0.94 \\pm 0.02} at a 95% confidence interval.\nWhen compared to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the COV-ELM is\nfound to outperform its competitors in this three-class classification\nscenario.

Adaptive dynamic\nprogramming methods provide a means to circumvent this issue. However, the few\nexisting approaches for port-Hamiltonian systems hinge on very specific\nsub-classes of either performance indices or system dynamics or require the\nintransparent guessing of stabilizing initial weights.

Concerns over reproducing societal bias should be informed by an\nunderstanding of the ways that inequality is continually reproduced in society\n-- processes that AI systems are either complicit in, or can be designed to\ndisrupt and counter.

For radio emission we assume a\ncanonical conal beam with a fixed emission height of 300~km across all spin\nperiods and a luminosity law which depends on Edot^{0.25}. For gamma-ray\nemission we assume the outer-gap model and a luminosity law which depends on\nEdot^{0.5}. We synthesise a population of fast-spinning pulsars with a birth\nrate of one per 100 years. We find that this simple model can reproduce most\ncharacteristics of the observed population with two caveats. The first is a\ndeficit of gamma-ray pulsars at the highest Edot which we surmise to be an\nobservational selection effect due to the difficulties of finding gamma-ray\npulsars in the presence of glitches without prior knowledge from radio\nfrequencies. The second is a deficit of radio pulsars with interpulse emission,\nwhich may be related to radio emission physics. We discuss the implications of\nthese findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 22:58:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

We found that the host galaxies are massive, with stellar mass\nMstar > 10^(10) Msun, and are mainly located on the green valley. This trend is\nconsistent with a scenario in which star formation of the host galaxies is\nsuppressed by AGN feedback, that is, AGN activity may be responsible for the\ntransition of these galaxies from the blue cloud to the red sequence.

To this end, an LfO\nsystem encodes a human demonstration into a series of execution units for a\nrobot, which are referred to as task models. Although previous research has\nproposed successful task-model encoders, there has been little discussion on\nhow to guide a task-model encoder in a scene with spatio-temporal noises, such\nas cluttered objects or unrelated human body movements. Inspired by the\nfunction of verbal instructions guiding an observer's visual attention, we\npropose a verbal focus-of-attention (FoA) system (i.e., spatio-temporal\nfilters) to guide a task-model encoder. For object manipulation, the system\nfirst recognizes the name of a target object and its attributes from verbal\ninstructions. The information serves as a where-to-look FoA filter to confine\nthe areas in which the target object existed in the demonstration. The system\nthen detects the timings of grasp and release that occurred in the filtered\nareas. The timings serve as a when-to-look FoA filter to confine the period of\nobject manipulation. Finally, a task-model encoder recognizes the task models\nby employing FoA filters. We demonstrate the robustness of the verbal FoA in\nattenuating spatio-temporal noises by comparing it with an existing action\nlocalization network. The contributions of this study are as follows: (1) to\npropose a verbal FoA for LfO, (2) to design an algorithm to calculate FoA\nfilters from verbal input, and (3) to demonstrate the effectiveness of a verbal\nFoA in localizing an action by comparing it with a state-of-the-art vision\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 00:57:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 05:49:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 11:16:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 15:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

Based on previous studies\non the effects of radiation on SOI pixel sensors, the positive charges trapped\nin the oxide layer significantly affect the performance of the sensor. To\nimprove the radiation hardness of the SOI pixel sensors, we introduced a\ndouble-SOI (D-SOI) structure containing an additional middle Si layer in the\noxide layer. The negative potential applied on the middle Si layer compensates\nfor the radiation effects, due to the trapped positive charges. Although the\nradiation hardness of the D-SOI pixel sensors for applications in high-energy\naccelerators has been evaluated, radiation effects for astronomical application\nin the D-SOI sensors has not been evaluated thus far. To evaluate the radiation\neffects of the D-SOI sensor, we perform an irradiation experiment using a 6-MeV\nproton beam with a total dose of ~ 5 krad, corresponding to a few tens of years\nof in-orbit operation. This experiment indicates an improvement in the\nradiation hardness of the X- ray D-SOI devices.

The period of the oscillation does not depend on the Fermi\nenergy. These behaviors cannot be described by the famous Lifshitz-Kosevich\nformula.

The standard method to construct the pre-IC is\nto place the particles on the lattice grids evenly spaced in the\nthree-dimensional spatial coordinates. However, even after the initial\ndisplacement of each particle according to cosmological perturbations, the\nparticle distribution remains to display an artificial anisotropy. Such an\nartifact causes systematic effects in simulations at later time until the\nevolved particle distribution sufficiently erases the initial anisotropy. In\nthis paper, we study the impacts of the pre-IC on the anisotropic separate\nuniverse simulation, where the effect of large-scale tidal field on structure\nformation is taken into account using the anisotropic expansion in a local\nbackground (simulation volume). To quantify the impacts, we compare the\nsimulations employing the standard grid pre-IC and the glass one, where the\nlatter is supposed to suppress the initial anisotropy. We show that the\nartificial features in the grid pre-IC simulations are seen until $z\\sim 9$,\nwhile the glass pre-IC simulations appear to be stable and accurate over the\nrange of scales we study. From these results we find that a coupling of the\nlarge-scale tidal field with matter clustering is enhanced compared to the\nleading-order prediction of perturbation theory in the quasi non-linear regime\nin the redshift range $5\\lesssim z\\lesssim 15$, indicating the importance of\ntidal field on structure formation at such high redshifts, e.g. during the\nepoch of reionization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 02:42:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 08:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-26"}

The key idea of\nmeta-learning for few-shot classification is to mimic the few-shot situations\nfaced at test time by randomly sampling classes in meta-training data to\nconstruct few-shot tasks for episodic training. While a rich line of work\nfocuses solely on how to extract meta-knowledge across tasks, we exploit the\ncomplementary problem on how to generate informative tasks. We argue that the\nrandomly sampled tasks could be sub-optimal and uninformative (e.g., the task\nof classifying \"dog\" from \"laptop\" is often trivial) to the meta-learner. In\nthis paper, we propose an adaptive task sampling method to improve the\ngeneralization performance. Unlike instance based sampling, task based sampling\nis much more challenging due to the implicit definition of the task in each\nepisode. Therefore, we accordingly propose a greedy class-pair based sampling\nmethod, which selects difficult tasks according to class-pair potentials. We\nevaluate our adaptive task sampling method on two few-shot classification\nbenchmarks, and it achieves consistent improvements across different feature\nbackbones, meta-learning algorithms and datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 03:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

Existing multivariate learning models take two\ntasks equivalently and optimize simultaneously. However, in addition to lesion\nfeatures, we observe that there is another type of feature, which is commonly\nintroduced during the procedure of preprocessing steps, which can improve the\nprediction result. We call such a type of feature as procedural bias.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose that the features/voxels in neuroimage\ndata are consist of three orthogonal parts: lesion features, procedural bias,\nand null features. To stably select lesion features and leverage procedural\nbias into prediction, we propose an iterative algorithm (termed GSplit LBI) as\na discretization of differential inclusion of inverse scale space, which is the\ncombination of Variable Splitting scheme and Linearized Bregman Iteration\n(LBI). Specifically, with a variable the splitting term, two estimators are\nintroduced and split apart, i.e. one is for feature selection (the sparse\nestimator) and the other is for prediction (the dense estimator). Implemented\nwith Linearized Bregman Iteration (LBI), the solution path of both estimators\ncan be returned with different sparsity levels on the sparse estimator for the\nselection of lesion features. Besides, the dense the estimator can additionally\nleverage procedural bias to further improve prediction results. To test the\nefficacy of our method, we conduct experiments on the simulated study and\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The validity and\nthe benefit of our model can be shown by the improvement of prediction results\nand the interpretability of visualized procedural bias and lesion features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 03:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

We have to admit, however, that high\nspectral dimension inevitably brings some drawbacks, such as expensive data\nstorage and transmission, information redundancy, etc. Therefore, to reduce the\nspectral dimensionality effectively and learn more discriminative spectral\nlow-dimensional embedding, in this paper we propose a novel hyperspectral\nembedding approach by simultaneously considering spatial and spectral\ninformation, called spatial-spectral manifold embedding (SSME). Beyond the\npixel-wise spectral embedding approaches, SSME models the spatial and spectral\ninformation jointly in a patch-based fashion. SSME not only learns the spectral\nembedding by using the adjacency matrix obtained by similarity measurement\nbetween spectral signatures, but also models the spatial neighbours of a target\npixel in hyperspectral scene by sharing the same weights (or edges) in the\nprocess of learning embedding.

It has recently been shown that\nvariational autoencoders, with Bernoulli latent representations parametrized by\nneural nets, can be successfully trained to learn such codes in supervised and\nunsupervised scenarios, improving on more traditional methods thanks to their\nability to handle the binary constraints architecturally. However, the scenario\nwhere labels are scarce has not been studied yet.\n  This paper investigates the robustness of hashing methods based on\nvariational autoencoders to the lack of supervision, focusing on two\nsemi-supervised approaches currently in use. The first augments the variational\nautoencoder's training objective to jointly model the distribution over the\ndata and the class labels. The second approach exploits the annotations to\ndefine an additional pairwise loss that enforces consistency between the\nsimilarity in the code (Hamming) space and the similarity in the label space.\nOur experiments show that both methods can significantly increase the hash\ncodes' quality. The pairwise approach can exhibit an advantage when the number\nof labelled points is large. However, we found that this method degrades\nquickly and loses its advantage when labelled samples decrease. To circumvent\nthis problem, we propose a novel supervision method in which the model uses its\nlabel distribution predictions to implement the pairwise objective.

These approaches, however, can result in substantial accuracy losses\ndue to fixed-point representation of the data and computation overflows. To\naddress these critical issues, we propose a novel algorithm to solve the\nproblem when data is in the analog domain, e.g., the field of real/complex\nnumbers. We characterize the privacy of the data from both\ninformation-theoretic and cryptographic perspectives, while establishing a\nconnection between the two notions in the analog domain. More specifically, the\nwell-known connection between the distinguishing security (DS) and the mutual\ninformation security (MIS) metrics is extended from the discrete domain to the\ncontinues domain. This is then utilized to bound the amount of information\nabout the data leaked to the servers in our protocol, in terms of the DS\nmetric, using well-known results on the capacity of single-input\nmultiple-output (SIMO) channel with correlated noise. It is shown how the\nproposed framework can be adopted to do computation tasks when data is\nrepresented using floating-point numbers. We then show that this leads to a\nfundamental trade-off between the privacy level of data and accuracy of the\nresult. As an application, we also show how to train a machine learning model\nwhile keeping the data as well as the trained model private. Then numerical\nresults are shown for experiments on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore,\nexperimental advantages are shown comparing to fixed-point implementations over\nfinite fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 07:56:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

Cellular\nVehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication technology has been one of the\nprominent services for 5G. For C-V2X transmission mode, there is a newly\ndefined communication channel (sidelink) that can support direct C-V2X\ncommunication. Direct C-V2X communication is a technology that allows vehicles\nto communicate and share safety-related information with other traffic\nparticipates directly without going through the cellular network. The C-V2X\ndata packet will be delivered to all traffic Users (UE) in the proximity of the\nTransmitter (Tx). Some UEs might not successfully receive the data packets\nduring one transmission but the sidelink Tx is not able to check whether the\nReceivers (Rxs) get the information or not due to the lack of feedback channel.\nFor enabling the strict requirements in terms of reliability and latency for\nC-V2X communication, we propose and evaluate one retransmission scheme and\nretransmission with different traffic speed scheme. These schemes try to\nimprove the reliability of the safety-related data by one blind retransmission\nwithout requiring feedback. Although this retransmission scheme is essential to\nC-V2X communication, the scheme has a limitation in the performance aspect\nbecause of its redundant retransmission. Since radio resources for CV2X\ncommunication are limited, we have to detect the effect of retransmission on\nthe performance of the communication system. To the end, the simulator for\nevaluating the proposed schemes for the C-V2X communication has been\nimplemented, and the performances of the different communication schemes are\nshown through the Packet Reception Ratio (PRR).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 08:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

The\nproposed model is parsimonious with only input information of the total lane\nlength of the network, the in-flux of demand, and the travel distance\ndistributions.

If in addition one assumes local energy equality,\nthis is equivalent to expressing the structure functions in terms of the local\ndissipation. Our precompactness assumption is also shown to produce stationary\nmartingale solutions of the Euler equations with the same type of forcing in\nthe vanishing viscosity limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 09:08:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 21:27:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

In a broad range of areas hand gesture\ntechniques can be applied specifically in sign language recognition, robotic\nsurgery, etc. In the process of hand gesture recognition, proper detection, and\ntracking of the moving hand become challenging due to the varied shape and size\nof the hand. Here the objective is to track the movement of the hand\nirrespective of the shape, size, and color of the hand. And, for this, a motion\ntemplate guided by optical flow (OFMT) is proposed. OFMT is a compact\nrepresentation of the motion information of a gesture encoded into a single\nimage. In the experimentation, different datasets using bare hand with an open\npalm, and folded palm wearing green-glove are used, and in both cases, we could\ngenerate the OFMT images with equal precision. Recently, deep network-based\ntechniques have shown impressive improvements as compared to conventional\nhand-crafted feature-based techniques. Moreover, in the literature, it is seen\nthat the use of different streams with informative input data helps to increase\nthe performance in the recognition accuracy. This work basically proposes a\ntwo-stream fusion model for hand gesture recognition and a compact yet\nefficient motion template based on optical flow. Specifically, the two-stream\nnetwork consists of two layers: a 3D convolutional neural network (C3D) that\ntakes gesture videos as input and a 2D-CNN that takes OFMT images as input. C3D\nhas shown its efficiency in capturing spatio-temporal information of a video.\nWhereas OFMT helps to eliminate irrelevant gestures providing additional motion\ninformation. Though each stream can work independently, they are combined with\na fusion scheme to boost the recognition results. We have shown the efficiency\nof the proposed two-stream network on two databases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 09:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

However, state-of-the-art SNNs\nrequire a large memory footprint to achieve high accuracy, thereby making them\ndifficult to be deployed on embedded systems, for instance on battery-powered\nmobile devices and IoT Edge nodes. Towards this, we propose FSpiNN, an\noptimization framework for obtaining memory- and energy-efficient SNNs for\ntraining and inference processing, with unsupervised learning capability while\nmaintaining accuracy. It is achieved by (1) reducing the computational\nrequirements of neuronal and STDP operations, (2) improving the accuracy of\nSTDP-based learning, (3) compressing the SNN through a fixed-point\nquantization, and (4) incorporating the memory and energy requirements in the\noptimization process. FSpiNN reduces the computational requirements by reducing\nthe number of neuronal operations, the STDP-based synaptic weight updates, and\nthe STDP complexity. To improve the accuracy of learning, FSpiNN employs\ntimestep-based synaptic weight updates, and adaptively determines the STDP\npotentiation factor and the effective inhibition strength. The experimental\nresults show that, as compared to the state-of-the-art work, FSpiNN achieves\n7.5x memory saving, and improves the energy-efficiency by 3.5x on average for\ntraining and by 1.8x on average for inference, across MNIST and Fashion MNIST\ndatasets, with no accuracy loss for a network with 4900 excitatory neurons,\nthereby enabling energy-efficient SNNs for edge devices/embedded systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 09:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

Recently,\ntwin-field (TF) QKD has been proposed and intensively studied, since it can\nbeat the rate-distance limit and greatly increase the achievable distance of\nQKD. Remarkalebly, K.

This approach enables a\nsmooth transition from the inertia-driven to the viscous-controlled regime of\ncrown propagation. The modelling strategy is based on the stagnation-point\nflow, because it resembles closely the hydrodynamic flow in the lamella and\noffers two main advantages. First, it allows a simple estimation of the\nwall-film thinning rate, caused by the impulse transfer from the impacting\ndroplet to the wall film. Second, thanks to the self-similarity of the\nsolution, it enables a straightforward estimation of momentum losses during\nfilm spreading along the wall. By incorporating this estimation into existing\ninviscid models, an excellent agreement with experiments is found during the\nentire crown elevation phase. In general, the analysis shows that momentum\nlosses due to viscous effects cannot be neglected during a significant portion\nof crown propagation, particularly for thin wall films. The proposed\nmethodology paves the way for predicting the inception of crown bottom breakup\n(CBB). In this case, the crown lamella disintegrates directly at its base due\nto the spontaneous creation of holes that create a web-like structure in the\nlamella prior to its break-up.

The main issue is that, often, data are collected,\ntransferred, and processed by third parties. These transactions violate new\nregulations, such as GDPR. Furthermore, users usually are not willing to share\nprivate data such as their visited locations, the text messages they wrote, or\nthe photo they took with a third party. On the other hand, users appreciate\nservices that work based on their behaviors and preferences. In order to\naddress these issues, Federated Learning (FL) has been recently proposed as a\nmeans to build ML models based on private datasets distributed over a large\nnumber of clients, while preventing data leakage. A federation of users is\nasked to train a same global model on their private data, while a central\ncoordinating server receives locally computed updates by clients and aggregate\nthem to obtain a better global model, without the need to use clients' actual\ndata. In this work, we extend the FL approach by pushing forward the\nstate-of-the-art approaches in the aggregation step of FL, which we deem\ncrucial for building a high-quality global model. Specifically, we propose an\napproach that takes into account a suite of client-specific criteria that\nconstitute the basis for assigning a score to each client based on a priority\nof criteria defined by the service provider. Extensive experiments on two\npublicly available datasets indicate the merits of the proposed approach\ncompared to standard FL baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 10:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

When\ndeveloping machine-learning based methods for automated segmentation, manual\nannotations are usually used as the ground truth toward which the models learn\nto mimic. While the bulky parts of the segmentation targets are relatively easy\nto label, the peripheral areas are often difficult to handle due to ambiguous\nboundaries and the partial volume effect, etc., and are likely to be labeled\nwith uncertainty. This uncertainty in labeling may, in turn, result in\nunsatisfactory performance of the trained models. In this paper, we propose\nsuperpixel-based label softening to tackle the above issue. Generated by\nunsupervised over-segmentation, each superpixel is expected to represent a\nlocally homogeneous area. If a superpixel intersects with the annotation\nboundary, we consider a high probability of uncertain labeling within this\narea. Driven by this intuition, we soften labels in this area based on signed\ndistances to the annotation boundary and assign probability values within [0,\n1] to them, in comparison with the original \"hard\", binary labels of either 0\nor 1. The softened labels are then used to train the segmentation models\ntogether with the hard labels.

Here we empirically show that\nchanging the balance between the attractive and the repulsive forces in t-SNE\nusing the exaggeration parameter yields a spectrum of embeddings, which is\ncharacterized by a simple trade-off: stronger attraction can better represent\ncontinuous manifold structures, while stronger repulsion can better represent\ndiscrete cluster structures and yields higher $k$NN recall.

In this\narticle, the behavior of a large number of ferrimagnetic spheres coupled to a\nsingle cavity is put under test. We use second-quantization modeling of\nharmonic oscillators to theoretically describe our experimental setup and\nunderstand the influence of several parameters. The magnon-polariton dispersion\nrelation is used to characterize the system, with a particular focus on the\nvacuum Rabi mode splitting due to multiple spheres. We combine the results\nobtained with simple hybrid systems to analyze the behavior of a more complex\none, and show that it can be devised in such a way to minimize the degrees of\nfreedom needed to completely describe it.

A lowest common\nancestor (LCA) of two vertices $u$ and $v$ is a common ancestor $w$ of $u$ and\n$v$ such that no descendant of $w$ has the same property. In this paper, we\nconsider the problem of computing an LCA, if any, for all pairs of vertices in\na DAG. The fastest known algorithms for this problem exploit fast matrix\nmultiplication subroutines and have running times ranging from $O(n^{2.687})$\n[Bender et al.~SODA'01] down to $O(n^{2.615})$ [Kowaluk and Lingas~ICALP'05]\nand $O(n^{2.569})$ [Czumaj et al.~TCS'07]. Somewhat surprisingly, all those\nbounds would still be $\\Omega(n^{2.5})$ even if matrix multiplication could be\nsolved optimally (i.e., $\\omega=2$). This appears to be an inherent barrier for\nall the currently known approaches, which raises the natural question on\nwhether one could break through the $O(n^{2.5})$ barrier for this problem.\n  In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively: in particular, we\npresent an $\\tilde O(n^{2.447})$ ($\\tilde O(n^{7/3})$ for $\\omega=2$) algorithm\nfor finding an LCA for all pairs of vertices in a DAG, which represents the\nfirst improvement on the running times for this problem in the last 13 years. A\nkey tool in our approach is a fast algorithm to partition the vertex set of the\ntransitive closure of $G$ into a collection of $O(\\ell)$ chains and $O(n/\\ell)$\nantichains, for a given parameter $\\ell$. As usual, a chain is a path while an\nantichain is an independent set. We then find, for all pairs of vertices, a\n\\emph{candidate} LCA among the chain and antichain vertices, separately. The\nfirst set is obtained via a reduction to min-max matrix multiplication. The\ncomputation of the second set can be reduced to Boolean matrix multiplication\nsimilarly to previous results on this problem.

A transition changes the current state to the next state,\nand every counter is either incremented, or decremented, or left unchanged. A\nstate and value for each counter is a configuration; and a computation is an\ninfinite sequence of configurations with transitions between successive\nconfigurations. A probabilistic VASS consists of a VASS along with a\nprobability distribution over the transitions for each state. Qualitative\nproperties such as state and configuration reachability have been widely\nstudied for VASS. In this work we consider multi-dimensional long-run average\nobjectives for VASS and probabilistic VASS. For a counter, the cost of a\nconfiguration is the value of the counter; and the long-run average value of a\ncomputation for the counter is the long-run average of the costs of the\nconfigurations in the computation. The multi-dimensional long-run average\nproblem given a VASS and a threshold value for each counter, asks whether there\nis a computation such that for each counter the long-run average value for the\ncounter does not exceed the respective threshold. For probabilistic VASS,\ninstead of the existence of a computation, we consider whether the expected\nlong-run average value for each counter does not exceed the respective\nthreshold. Our main results are as follows: we show that the multi-dimensional\nlong-run average problem (a) is NP-complete for integer-valued VASS; (b) is\nundecidable for natural-valued VASS (i.e., nonnegative counters); and (c) can\nbe solved in polynomial time for probabilistic integer-valued VASS, and\nprobabilistic natural-valued VASS when all computations are non-terminating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 11:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

In the VIPriors challenge, only very limited numbers of\ntraining samples are allowed, leading to that the current state-of-the-art and\ndeep learning-based semantic segmentation techniques are hard to train well. To\novercome this shortcoming, therefore, we propose edge-preserving guidance to\nobtain the extra prior information, to avoid the overfitting under small-scale\ntraining dataset. First, a two-channeled convolutional layer is concatenated to\nthe last layer of the conventional semantic segmentation network. Then, an edge\nmap is calculated from the ground truth by Sobel operation and followed by\nconcatenating a hard-thresholding operation to indicate whether the pixel is\nthe edge or not. Then, the two-dimensional cross-entropy loss is adopted to\ncalculate the loss between the predicted edge map and its ground truth, termed\nas an edge-preserving loss. In this way, the continuity of boundaries between\ndifferent instances can be forced by the proposed edge-preserving loss.\nExperiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve excellent\nperformance under small-scale training set, compared to state-of-the-art\nsemantic segmentation techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 11:49:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

We define two small languages that support decision-making\nabstractions: one with choices and rewards, and the other additionally with\nprobabilities. We give both operational and denotational semantics.\n  In the case of the second language we consider three denotational semantics,\nwith varying degrees of correlation between possible program values and\nexpected rewards. The operational semantics combine the usual semantics of\nstandard constructs with optimization over spaces of possible execution\nstrategies. The denotational semantics, which are compositional, rely on the\nselection monad, to handle choice, augmented with an auxiliary monad to handle\nother effects, such as rewards or probability.\n  We establish adequacy theorems that the two semantics coincide in all cases.\nWe also prove full abstraction at base types, with varying notions of\nobservation in the probabilistic case corresponding to the various degrees of\ncorrelation. We present axioms for choice combined with rewards and\nprobability, establishing completeness at base types for the case of rewards\nwithout probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 12:13:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 18:53:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 18:33:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 11:48:28 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 02:11:21 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 00:30:18 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2023 04:01:39 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 22:34:28 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 07:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

In our proposed Modified Frequency\nResponse Masking (ModFRM) architecture, the modal filter and complementary\nfilter in conventional FRM approach are replaced by a power complementary and\nlinear phase FB. Additionally, a new masking strategy is proposed by which an\nM-channel FB can be designed by alternately masking even channels and odd\nchannels. By using this masking strategy, it is only necessary to alternately\nmask even channels and odd channels by the two masking filters while modulating\nthem over the multiple spectra replicas appearing in [0,2$\\pi$] to generate\nuniform ModFRM FB. Also, reconfigurability of filter bank can be achieved by\nadjusting the interpolation values appropriately, to obtain more masking\nresponses. To reduce the overall implementation complexity, masking filters are\noptimized using the interpolated FIR (IFIR) technique. The results indicate\nthat the proposed method requires substantially less multipliers in comparison\nto the reconfigurable FB existing in literature. Finally, non-uniform FB are\ngenerated from the uniform FB by combining nearby channels. The proposed\nnon-uniform ModFRM FB is used for the extraction of different communication\nstandards in the software defined radio (SDR) channelizer. When more channels\nare to be extracted, the proposed scheme was able to achieve a reduced hardware\ncomplexity in comparison to other filter bank based SDR channelizers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 12:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

Since recording dynamics is a\nlaborious task that requires expensive sensors and complex, time-consuming\noptimization, dynamics data sets are small compared to human motion data sets\nand are rarely made public.

We\nalso adapted the formalism of the excitation and amplitude of stochastically\nexcited gravito-inertial modes to rapidly rotating stars, and we modelled those\npulsations as well. We find that while pulsation p modes are excited by the\nkappa mechanism, the observed g modes are a result of stochastic excitation. In\ncontrast, g and r waves are stochastically excited in the convective core and\ntransport angular momentum to the surface, increasing its rotation rate. This\ndestabilises the external layers of the star, which then emits transient\nstochastically excited g waves. These transient waves produce most of the\nlow-frequency signal detected in the CoRoT data and ignite the outburst. During\nthis unstable phase, p modes disappear at the surface because their cavity is\nbroken. Following the outburst and ejection of the surface layer, relaxation\noccurs, making the transient g waves disappear and p modes reappear. This work\nincludes the first coherent model of stochastically excited gravito-inertial\npulsation modes in a rapidly rotating Be star. It provides an explanation for\nthe correlation between the variation in the amplitude of frequencies detected\nin the CoRoT data and the occurrence of an outburst. This scenario could apply\nto other pulsating Be stars, providing an explanation to the long-standing\nquestions surrounding Be outbursts and disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 13:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

This is a forward model of\nthe process by which images of the night sky are transformed into a 3D\nlarge--scale structure catalog. The photometric pipeline automatically detects\nand models galaxies and then generates a catalog of such galaxies with detailed\ninformation for each one of them, including their location, redshift and so on.\nSystematic biases in the imaging data are therefore imparted into the catalogs\nand must be accounted for in any scientific analysis of their information\ncontent.\n  Obiwan simulates this process for samples selected from the Legacy Surveys\nimaging data. This imaging data will be used to select target samples for the\nnext-generation Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) experiment. Here,\nwe apply Obiwan to a portion of the SDSS-IV extend Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey Emission Line Galaxies (ELG) sample. Systematic biases in\nthe data are clearly identified and removed. We compare the 3D clustering\nresults to those obtained by the map--based approach applied to the full eBOSS\nsample.

Our baseline HOD shape was fitted to a\nsemi-analytical model of galaxy formation and evolution, with a decaying\noccupation of central ELGs at high halo masses.

There is a finite set of resources and\nthe strategy set of each player corresponds to a set of subsets of resources.\nThe cost of a resource is an arbitrary function that depends on the load vector\nof the resources in a specified neighborhood. As our main result, we give\ncomplete characterizations of the cost functions guaranteeing the existence of\npure Nash equilibria for weighted and unweighted players, respectively.\n  1. For unweighted players, pure Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist for\nany choice of the players' strategy space if and only if the cost of each\nresource is an arbitrary function of the load of the resource itself and linear\nin the load of all other resources where the linear coefficients of mutual\ninfluence of different resources are symmetric.\n  2.

For the special case that the players' strategy sets are matroids, we show\nthat pure Nash equilibria exist under a local monotonicity property, even when\ncost functions are player-specific.

We aim to\nquantify the influence of planetary bulk composition on the\ninterior--atmosphere evolution for Earth-sized terrestrial planets to aid in\nthe interpretation of future observations of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres.\nMethods: We used a geochemical model to determine the major-element composition\nof planetary interiors (MgO, FeO, and SiO2) following the crystallization of a\nmagma ocean after planet formation, predicting a compositional profile of the\ninterior as an initial condition for our long-term thermal evolution model. Our\n1D evolution model predicts the pressure-temperature structure of the interior,\nwhich we used to evaluate near-surface melt production and subsequent volatile\noutgassing. Volatiles are exchanged between the interior and atmosphere\naccording to mass conservation. Results: Based on stellar compositions reported\nin the Hypatia catalog, we predict that about half of rocky exoplanets have a\nmantle that convects as a single layer (whole-mantle convection), and the other\nhalf exhibit double-layered convection due to the presence of a mid-mantle\ncompositional boundary. Double-layered convection is more likely for planets\nwith high bulk planetary Fe-content and low Mg/Si-ratio. We find that planets\nwith low Mg/Si-ratio tend to cool slowly because their mantle viscosity is\nhigh. Accordingly, low-Mg/Si planets also tend to lose volatiles swiftly\nthrough extensive melting. Moreover, the dynamic regime of the lithosphere\n(plate tectonics vs.\\ stagnant lid) has a first-order influence on the thermal\nevolution and volatile cycling. These results suggest that the composition of\nterrestrial exoplanetary atmospheres can provide information on the dynamic\nregime of the lithosphere and the thermo-chemical evolution of the interior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 14:19:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 12:20:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

We must schedule a number of jobs on $m$ machines, where\neach job has unit length, and the graph of precedence constraints consists of a\nset of chains. Each precedence constraint is labelled with an integer that\ndenotes the exact (or minimum) delay between the jobs. We study different\ncases; delays can be given in unary and in binary, and the case that we have a\nsingle machine is discussed separately. We consider the complexity of this\nproblem parameterized by the number of chains, and by the thickness of the\ninstance, which is the maximum number of chains whose intervals between release\ndate and deadline overlap.\n  We show that this scheduling problem with exact delays in unary is\n$W[t]$-hard for all $t$, when parameterized by the thickness, even when we have\na single machine ($m = 1$). When parameterized by the number of chains, this\nproblem is $W[1]$-complete when we have a single or a constant number of\nmachines, and $W[2]$-complete when the number of machines is a variable. The\nproblem with minimum delays, given in unary, parameterized by the number of\nchains (and as a simple corollary, also when parameterized by the thickness) is\n$W[1]$-hard for a single or a constant number of machines, and $W[2]$-hard when\nthe number of machines is variable.\n  With a dynamic programming algorithm, one can show membership in XP for exact\nand minimum delays in unary, for any number of machines, when parameterized by\nthickness or number of chains. For a single machine, with exact delays in\nbinary, parameterized by the number of chains, membership in XP can be shown\nwith branching and solving a system of difference constraints. For all other\ncases for delays in binary, membership in XP is open.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 14:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

We show that entropy-conserving\ntwo-point fluxes are inherently locally energy unstable, as they can be\ndissipative or anti-dissipative.

However, the computing of GCN usually requires a large memory\nspace for keeping the entire graph. In consequence, GCN is not flexible enough,\nespecially for large scale graphs in complex real-world applications.\nFortunately, methods based on Matrix Factorization (MF) naturally support\nconstructing mini-batches, and thus are more friendly to distributed computing\ncompared with GCN. Accordingly, in this paper, we analyze the connections\nbetween GCN and MF, and simplify GCN as matrix factorization with unitization\nand co-training. Furthermore, under the guidance of our analysis, we propose an\nalternative model to GCN named Unitized and Co-training Matrix Factorization\n(UCMF). Extensive experiments have been conducted on several real-world\ndatasets. On the task of semi-supervised node classification, the experimental\nresults illustrate that UCMF achieves similar or superior performances compared\nwith GCN. Meanwhile, distributed UCMF significantly outperforms distributed GCN\nmethods, which shows that UCMF can greatly benefit large scale and complex\nreal-world applications.

These include some\nsuspicious high-redshift (z >= 5) active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we\npresent a method for inspecting the high-redshift identification of such\nsources provided that they are radio-loud and have very long baseline\ninterferometry (VLBI) imaging observations of their milli-arcsec (mas) scale\njet structure available at multiple epochs. The method is based on the\ndetermination of jet component proper motions, and the fact that the\ncombination of jet physics (the observed maximal values of the bulk Lorentz\nfactor) and cosmology (the time dilation of observed phenomena in the early\nUniverse) constrain the possible values of apparent proper motions. As an\nexample, we present the case of the quasar J2346+0705 that was reported with\ntwo different redshifts, $z_{1} = 5.063$ and $z_{2} = 0.171$, in the\nliterature. We measured the apparent proper motions ($\\mu$) of three components\nidentified in its radio jet by utilizing VLBI data taken from 2014 to 2018. We\nobtained $\\mu_{J1} = 0.334 \\pm 0.099$ mas yr$^{-1}$, $\\mu_{J2} = 0.116 \\pm\n0.029$ mas yr$^{-1}$, and $\\mu_{J3} = 0.060 \\pm 0.005$ mas yr$^{-1}$.

The main result\ngeneralizes this statement to metric Lie algebras with any number of\nirreducible factors and which are not necessarily $2$-step nilpotent. It states\nthat there are either $0$ or $2^k$ such complex structures, with $k$ the number\nof irreducible factors of the metric Lie algebra.

In this paper, we\ndevelop a method of ``direct standardization'' where we re-weight each hospital\npatient population to be representative of the overall population and then\ncompare the weighted averages across hospitals. Adapting methods from survey\nsampling and causal inference, we find weights that directly control for\nimbalance between the hospital patient mix and the target population, even\nacross many patient attributes. Critically, these balancing weights can also be\ntuned to preserve sample size for more precise estimates.

Since it is difficult to directly match the\ncross-domain joint distributions, existing methods tend to reduce the marginal\nor conditional distribution divergence using predefined distances such as MMD\nand adversarial-based discrepancies. However, it remains challenging to\ndetermine which method is suitable for a given application since they are built\nwith certain priors or bias. Thus they may fail to uncover the underlying\nrelationship between transferable features and joint distributions. This paper\nproposes Learning to Match (L2M) to automatically learn the cross-domain\ndistribution matching without relying on hand-crafted priors on the matching\nloss. Instead, L2M reduces the inductive bias by using a meta-network to learn\nthe distribution matching loss in a data-driven way. L2M is a general framework\nthat unifies task-independent and human-designed matching features. We design a\nnovel optimization algorithm for this challenging objective with\nself-supervised label propagation.

It becomes a challenge in the presence of numerous\nconfigurations of learning algorithms on massive amounts of data. So there is a\nneed for an intelligent recommendation engine that can advise what is the best\nlearning algorithm for a dataset. The techniques that are commonly used by\nexperts are based on a trial and error approach evaluating and comparing a\nnumber of possible solutions against each other, using their prior experience\non a specific domain, etc. The trial and error approach combined with the\nexpert's prior knowledge, though computationally and time expensive, have been\noften shown to work for stationary problems where the processing is usually\nperformed off-line.

To solve this problem, we propose\nseveral algorithms to improve the robustness of SLAM, which mainly include (1)\na histogram voting-based method to roughly select possible inliers from the\nfeature matching results, (2) a novel 1-point RANSAC-based P$n$P algorithm\ncalled as DynamicR1PP$n$P to track the camera motion and (3) a GPU-based\niterative closest points (ICP) and bundle adjustment (BA) method to refine the\ncamera motion estimation results. Experimental results on ex- and in vivo data\nshowed that the reconstructed 3D models have high resolution texture with an\naccuracy error of less than 2 mm. Most algorithms are highly parallelized for\nGPU computation, and the average runtime for processing one key frame is 76.3\nms on stereo images with 960x540 resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 19:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-27"}

Unlike most conventional recommender\napproaches where items are inanimate entities recommended to the users and\nsuccess is solely determined upon the end users reaction to the\nrecommendation(s) received, in a Reciprocal Recommender System (RRS) users\nbecome the item being recommended to other users.
