Furthermore, they are fundamental to the uses of\nperturbative QCD, by determining the important regions of momentum space in\nasymptotic problems. Generalizations are also useful. We will show that in\nexisting treatments there are significant gaps in derivations, and in some\ncases implicit assumptions that will be shown here to be false in important\ncases like the massless Feynman graphs ubiquitous in QCD applications. In this\npaper is given a new proof that the Landau condition is both necessary and\nsufficient for physical-region pinches in the kinds of integral typified by\nFeynman graphs. The proof's range is broad enough to include the modified\nFeynman graphs that are used in QCD applications. Unlike many existing\nderivations, there is no need to use the Feynman parameter method. Some\npossible further applications of the new proof and its subsidiary results are\nproposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 17:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

As\nsuch, this study investigates these characteristics in the presence of additive\nGaussian white noise for both pure noise and mixed signals. By analyzing the\nprobability and independence of power spectrum bins, and the relationship\nbetween the F and beta distributions, we develop a probability distribution for\nthe PSER. Results showed that in the case of pure noise, the PSER follows a\nbeta distribution. In addition, the probability density function and the\nquantile exhibited no relationship with the noise variance, only with the\nnumber of lines in the power spectrum, that is, PSER is not affected by noise.\nWhen Gaussian white noise was mixed with the known signal, the resulting PSER\nfollowed a doubly non-central beta distribution. In this case, it was difficult\nto identify the quantile, as the probability density and cumulative\ndistribution functions were represented by infinite series. However, when a\nspectral bin did not contain the power spectrum of the known signal, an\napproximated quantile was found. This quantile is strictly proved to be in\nagreement with the quantile in the case of pure noise and offers a convenient\nmethodology for identifying valid signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 16:03:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 06:41:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-19"}

Most\nnotable is the case of chest radiography, where there is a high inter-rater\nvariability in the detection and classification of abnormalities. This is\nlargely due to inconclusive evidence in the data or subjective definitions of\ndisease appearance. An additional example is the classification of anatomical\nviews based on 2D Ultrasound images. Often, the anatomical context captured in\na frame is not sufficient to recognize the underlying anatomy. Current machine\nlearning solutions for these problems are typically limited to providing\nprobabilistic predictions, relying on the capacity of underlying models to\nadapt to limited information and the high degree of label noise. In practice,\nhowever, this leads to overconfident systems with poor generalization on unseen\ndata. To account for this, we propose a system that learns not only the\nprobabilistic estimate for classification, but also an explicit uncertainty\nmeasure which captures the confidence of the system in the predicted output. We\nargue that this approach is essential to account for the inherent ambiguity\ncharacteristic of medical images from different radiologic exams including\ncomputed radiography, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. In our\nexperiments we demonstrate that sample rejection based on the predicted\nuncertainty can significantly improve the ROC-AUC for various tasks, e.g., by\n8% to 0.91 with an expected rejection rate of under 25% for the classification\nof different abnormalities in chest radiographs.

We show that the evolution of the convection zone is\nwell-described by an entrainment prescription in which a fixed fraction of the\nkinetic energy of convective motions is used to mix fluid at the interface with\nthe stable layer. We measure the entrainment efficiency and find that it grows\nwith decreasing Prandtl number or increased applied heat flux. The kinetic\nenergy flux that determines the entrainment rate is a small fraction of the\ntotal convective luminosity. In this time-dependent situation, the density\nratio at the interface is driven to a narrow range that depends on the value of\nPr, and with low enough values that advection dominates the interfacial\ntransport. We characterize the interfacial flux ratio and how it depends on the\ninterface stability.

Thanks to\ntechnological advancements in microelectronics and micro-systems, the terahertz\n(THz) band has emerged as a strong candidate for inter-satellite links (ISLs)\ndue to its promise of high data rates. Yet, the propagation conditions of the\nTHz band need to be properly modeled and controlled by utilizing reconfigurable\nintelligent surfaces (RISs) to leverage their full potential. In this work, we\nfirst provide an assessment of the use of the THz band for ISLs, and quantify\nthe impact of misalignment fading on error performance. Then, in order to\ncompensate for the high path loss associated with high carrier frequencies, and\nto further improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we propose the use of RISs\nmounted on neighboring satellites to enable signal propagation. Based on a\nmathematical analysis of the problem, we present the error rate expressions for\nRIS-assisted ISLs with misalignment fading. Also, numerical results show that\nRIS can leverage the error rate performance and achievable capacity of THz\nISLs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 17:32:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 05:55:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2021 20:04:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 20:04:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 19:16:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Fasting and administration of hyoscine butylbromide (BUSC) have been\nproposed for bowel motion reduction, but with inconsistent results and limited\nefficacy assessments. Here, we evaluate these regimes for mouse abdominal MRI\nat high field. Methods: Thirty-two adult C57BL/6J mice were imaged on a 9.4T\nscanner with a FLASH sequence, acquired over 90 minutes with ~19s temporal\nresolution. During MRI acquisition, eight mice were injected with a low-dose\nand eight mice with a high-dose bolus of BUSC (0.5 and 5 mg/kg, respectively).\nEight mice were food deprived for 4.5-6.5h before MRI and another group of 8\nmice was injected with saline during MRI acquisition. Two expert readers\nreviewed the images and classified bowel motion, and quantitative voxel-wise\nanalyses were performed for identification of moving regions. After defining\nthe most effective protocol, high-resolution T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted\nimages were acquired from four mice. Results: High-dose BUSC was the most\neffective protocol for bowel motion reduction, for up to 45 minutes. Fasting\nand saline protocols were not effective in suppressing bowel motion.\nHigh-resolution abdominal MRI clearly demonstrated improved image quality and\nADC quantification with the high-dose BUSC protocol. Conclusion: Our data show\nthat BUSC administration is advantageous for abdominal MRI in the mouse.\nSpecifically, it endows significant bowel motion reduction, with relatively\nshort onset timings after injection (~8.5 minutes) and relatively long duration\nof the effect (~45 minutes). These features improve the quality of\nhigh-resolution images of the mouse abdomen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 17:32:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 16:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-17"}

First, due to the lack of hardware-level coherence, the MGPU\nprogramming model requires the programmer to replicate and repeatedly transfer\ndata between the GPUs' memory. This leads to inefficient use of precious GPU\nmemory. Second, to maintain coherency across an MGPU system, transferring data\nusing low-bandwidth and high-latency off-chip links leads to degradation in\nsystem performance. Third, since the programmer needs to manually maintain data\ncoherence, the programming of an MGPU system to maximize its throughput is\nextremely challenging.

This scenario heavily relies upon the possibility to excite current\ndriven non-resonant hybrid modes while the shock is still at the beginning of\nthe Sedov phase. These modes can enhance the rate of particle scattering\nthereby leading to potentially very-high maximum energies.

Hole spins in Ge/Si core/shell nanowires experience a\nspin-orbit interaction that has been predicted to be both strong and\nelectrically tunable, making them a particularly promising platform for\nresearch in these fields. We experimentally determine the strength of\nspin-orbit interaction of hole spins confined to a double quantum dot in a\nGe/Si nanowire by measuring spin-mixing transitions inside a regime of\nspin-blockaded transport. We find a remarkably short spin-orbit length of\n$\\sim$65 nm, comparable to the quantum dot length and the interdot distance. We\nadditionally observe a large orbital effect of the applied magnetic field on\nthe hole states, resulting in a large magnetic field dependence of the\nspin-mixing transition energies. Strikingly, together with these orbital\neffects, the strong spin-orbit interaction causes a significant enhancement of\nthe $g$-factor with magnetic field.The large spin-orbit interaction strength\ndemonstrated is consistent with the predicted direct Rashba spin-orbit\ninteraction in this material system and is expected to enable ultrafast Rabi\noscillations of spin qubits and efficient qubit-qubit interactions, as well as\nprovide a platform suitable for studying Majorana zero modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 17:54:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-28"}

We show with\nsimulations that all of the extragalactic foregrounds in temperature can be\napproximated by a collection of sources with identical profiles, and that a\nsimple bias hardening technique is effective at reducing any bias to lensing,\nat a minimal noise cost. We compare the performance and bias to other methods\nsuch as \"shear-only\" reconstruction, and discuss how to jointly deproject any\narbitrary number of foregrounds, each with an arbitrary profile. In particular,\nfor a Simons Observatory-like experiment foreground-hardened estimators allow\nus to extend the maximum multipole used in the reconstruction, increasing the\noverall statistical power by $\\sim 50\\%$ over the standard quadratic estimator,\nboth in auto and cross-correlation. We conclude that source hardening\noutperforms the standard lensing quadratic estimator both in auto and\ncross-correlation, and in terms of lensing signal-to-noise and foreground bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 19:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

A natural question is then how realistic and\nuniversal those properties are. Here, we address these issues by considering a\ndifferent description of dissipative quantum systems, namely, the discrete-time\nKraus map representation of completely positive quantum dynamics. Through\nrandom matrix theory (RMT) techniques and numerical exact diagonalization, we\nstudy random Kraus maps, allowing for a varying dissipation strength, and their\nlocal circuit counterpart. We find the spectrum of the random Kraus map to be\neither an annulus or a disk inside the unit circle in the complex plane, with a\ntransition between the two cases taking place at a critical value of\ndissipation strength. The eigenvalue distribution and the spectral transition\nare well described by a simplified RMT model that we can solve exactly in the\nthermodynamic limit, by means of non-Hermitian RMT and quaternionic free\nprobability. The steady state, on the contrary, is not affected by the spectral\ntransition. It has, however, a perturbative crossover regime at small\ndissipation, inside which the steady state is characterized by uncorrelated\neigenvalues. At large dissipation (or for any dissipation for a large-enough\nsystem), the steady state is well described by a random Wishart matrix. The\nsteady-state properties thus coincide with those already observed for random\nLindbladian dynamics, indicating their universality. Quite remarkably, the\nstatistical properties of the local Kraus circuit are qualitatively the same as\nthose of the nonlocal Kraus map, indicating that the latter, which is more\ntractable, already captures the realistic and universal physical properties of\ngeneric open quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 14:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

The approach is bottom-up, aiming at a synergy between the\nobserved dynamics and the mathematical modeling. Being the focus the long-term\nevolution of the eccentricity, the dynamical model adopted is a doubly-averaged\nformulation of the third-body perturbation due to Sun and Moon, coupled with\nthe oblateness effect on the orientation of the satellite. The numerical\nevolution of the eccentricity, obtained by a two-degree-of-freedom model\nassuming different orders in the series expansion of the third-body effect, is\ncompared against the mean evolution given by the TLE. The results show that,\ndespite being highly elliptical orbits, the second order expansion catches\nextremely well the behavior.

Even with apparent successes in numerous application\nfields, a rising concern is the robustness of Bayesian inference in the\npresence of model misspecification, which may lead to undesirable extreme\nbehavior of the posterior distributions for large sample sizes. Generalized\nbelief updating with a loss function represents a central principle to making\nBayesian inference more robust and less vulnerable to deviations from the\nassumed model. Here we consider such updates with $f$-divergences to quantify a\ndiscrepancy between the assumed statistical model and the probability\ndistribution which generated the observed data. Since the latter is generally\nunknown, estimation of the divergence may be viewed as an intractable problem.\nWe show that the divergence becomes accessible through the use of probabilistic\nclassifiers that can leverage an estimate of the ratio of two probability\ndistributions even when one or both of them is unknown. We demonstrate the\nbehavior of generalized belief updates for various specific choices under the\n$f$-divergence family. We show that for specific divergence functions such an\napproach can even improve on methods evaluating the correct model likelihood\nfunction analytically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 18:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

Their connection helps gain\nphysical insight into the behaviour of the thermoacoustic spectrum when\nparameters of the system are varied. First, we extend high-order adjoint-based\nperturbation theory of thermoacoustic modes to the degenerate case. We provide\nexplicit formulae for the calculation of the eigenvalue corrections to any\norder. These formulae are valid for self-adjoint, non-self-adjoint or even\nnon-normal systems; therefore, they can be applied to a large range of\nproblems, including fluid dynamics. Second, by analysing the expansion\ncoefficients of the eigenvalue corrections as a function of a parameter of\ninterest, we accurately estimate the radius of convergence of the power series.\nThird, we connect the existence of a finite radius of convergence to the\nexistence of singularities in parameter space. We identify these singularities\nas exceptional points, which correspond to defective thermoacoustic\neigenvalues, with infinite sensitivity to infinitesimal changes in the\nparameters. At an exceptional point, two eigenvalues and their associated\neigenvectors coalesce. Close to an exceptional point, strong veering of the\neigenvalue trajectories is observed. As demonstrated in recent work,\nexceptional points naturally arise in thermoacoustic systems due to the\ninteraction between modes of acoustic and intrinsic origin. The role of\nexceptional points in thermoacoustic systems sheds new light on the physics and\nsensitivity of thermoacoustic stability, which can be leveraged for passive\ncontrol by small design modifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 18:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Simultaneously, the electroweak scale is generated through the\nradiative corrections involving these massive fermions. This is the essence of\nthe scenario that is known as the \"neutrino option\" for which the successful\nmasses of right-handed neutrinos are in the range $10^7-10^8$ GeV. The main\ngoal of this work is to scrutinize the potential to accommodate dark matter in\nsuch a realization.

Such\nstructure is well motivated by (i) high-dimensional weights that are common in\nmodern applications, and (ii) ubiquitous examples in which equal weights --\ndespite their simplicity -- often achieve favorable or even state-of-the-art\npredictive performance. This particular structure, however, presents unique\nchallenges partly because, unlike high-dimensional linear regression, the\nparameter space is a simplex and pattern switching between partial constancy\nand sparsity is unknown.

In particular, the proposed MGMN consists of a\nnode-graph matching network for effectively learning cross-level interactions\nbetween each node of one graph and the other whole graph, and a siamese graph\nneural network to learn global-level interactions between two input graphs.\nFurthermore, to compensate for the lack of standard benchmark datasets, we have\ncreated and collected a set of datasets for both the graph-graph classification\nand graph-graph regression tasks with different sizes in order to evaluate the\neffectiveness and robustness of our models.

However, their practical use is limited by their high computational\ncost, as an optimization problem has to be solved for every cell in the\nspace-time grid. In addition, implementation of numerical solvers for these\nmodels is hampered by the fact that the optimization problems are only\nwell-defined if the moment vectors stay within the realizable set. For the same\nreason, further reducing these models by, e.g., reduced-basis methods is not a\nsimple task. Our new method overcomes these disadvantages of classical\napproaches. The transformation is performed on the semi-discretized level which\nmakes them applicable to a wide range of kinetic schemes and replaces the\nnonlinear optimization problems by inversion of the positive-definite Hessian\nmatrix. As a result, the new scheme gets rid of the realizability-related\nproblems. Moreover, a discrete entropy law can be enforced by modifying the\ntime stepping scheme. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our new method\nis often several times faster than the standard optimization-based scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 22:53:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 12:02:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 09:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

This notion of\nfairness is suitable in cases where fairness is prioritized over accuracy, such\nas in cases where there is no \"ground truth\" data, only data labeled with past\ndecisions (which may have been biased).\n  - Algorithms for retraining a given classifier to achieve \"controlled\nfairness\" with respect to a choice of features and filters. Two algorithms are\npresented, implemented and tested. These algorithms require training two\ndifferent models in two stages. We experiment with combinations of various\ntypes of models for the first and second stage and report on which combinations\nperform best in terms of fairness and accuracy.\n  - Algorithms for adjusting model parameters to achieve a notion of fairness\ncalled \"classification parity\". This notion of fairness is suitable in cases\nwhere accuracy is prioritized. Two algorithms are presented, one which assumes\nthat protected features are accessible to the model during testing, and one\nwhich assumes protected features are not accessible during testing.\n  We evaluate our tools on three different publicly available datasets. We find\nthat the tools are useful for understanding various dimensions of bias, and\nthat in practice the algorithms are effective in starkly reducing a given\nobserved bias when tested on new data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 00:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

The energy-dependent X-ray attenuation\nprofiles can be represented by a set of coefficients using the Alvarez-Macovski\n(AM) method. An ME X-ray transform is a mapping from $N$ AM coefficients to $N$\nnoise-free energy-weighted measurements, where $N\\geq2$.\n  Methods: We apply a general invertibility theorem which tests whether the\nJacobian of the mapping $J(\\mathbf A)$ has zero values over the support of the\nmapping. The Jacobian of an arbitrary ME X-ray transform is an integration over\nall spectral measurements. A sufficient condition of $J(\\mathbf A)\\neq0$ for\nall $\\mathbf A$ is that the integrand of $J(\\mathbf A)$ is $\\geq0$ (or $\\leq0$)\neverywhere. Note that the trivial case of the integrand equals to zero\neverywhere is ignored. With symmetry, we simplified the integrand of the\nJacobian into three factors that are determined by the total attenuation, the\nbasis functions, and the energy-weighting functions, respectively. The factor\nrelated to total attenuation is always positive, hence the invertibility of the\nX-ray transform can be determined by testing the signs of the other two\nfactors. Furthermore, we use the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to characterize\nthe noise-induced estimation uncertainty and provide a maximum-likelihood (ML)\nestimator.\n  Conclusions: We have provided a framework to study the invertibility of an\narbitrary ME X-ray transform and proved the global invertibility for four types\nof systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 00:51:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 15:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

However, such\nan unprecedented scale of GPS data has posed an urgent demand for not only an\neffective storage mechanism but also an efficient query mechanism. Line\nsimplification in online mode, searving as a mainstream trajectory compression\nmethod, plays an important role to attack this issue. But for the existing\nalgorithms, either their time cost is extremely high, or the accuracy loss\nafter the compression is completely unacceptable. To attack this issue, we\npropose $\\epsilon \\_$Region based Online trajectory Compression with Error\nbounded (ROCE for short), which makes the best balance among the accuracy loss,\nthe time cost and the compression rate. The range query serves as a primitive,\nyet quite essential operation on analyzing trajectories. Each trajectory is\nusually seen as a sequence of discrete points, and in most previous work, a\ntrajectory is judged to be overlapped with the query region R iff there is at\nleast one point in this trajectory falling in R. But this traditional criteria\nis not suitable when the queried trajectories are compressed, because there may\nbe hundreds of points discarded between each two adjacent points and the points\nin each compressed trajectory are quite sparse. And many trajectories could be\nmissing in the result set.

The control decisions are influenced by various factors, such as energy\nstorage, renewable energy yield, electrical load, and competition from other\nmicrogrids. Making the optimal control decision is challenging, due to the\ncomplexity of the interconnected microgrids, the uncertainty of renewable\nenergy generation and consumption, and the interplay among microgrids.

Here we present a\npreliminary study of radial elongations $\\tau$ of a large sample of X-ray\ncavities, which are apparently produced by mechanical AGN feedback. All the\ncavities in our sample are elongated along the angular (type-I) or jet\ndirections (type-II), or nearly circular (type-III). The observed value of\n$\\tau$ roughly decreases as the cavities rise buoyantly, confirming the same\ntrend found in hydrodynamic simulations. For young cavities, both type-I and II\ncavities exist, and the latter dominates. Assuming a spheroidal cavity shape,\nwe derive an analytical relation between the intrinsic radial elongation\n$\\bar{\\tau}$ and the inclination-angle-dependent value of $\\tau$, showing that\nprojection effect makes cavities appear more circular, but does not change\ntype-I cavities into type-II ones, or vice versa. We summarize radial\nelongations of young cavities in simulations, finding that $\\bar{\\tau}$\nincreases with the kinetic fraction of AGN jets. While mild jets always produce\ntype-II cavities, thermal-energy-dominated strong jets produce type-I cavities,\nand kinetic-energy-dominated strong jets produce type-II cavities. Our results\nsuggest that some AGN jets are strong and dominated by thermal energy (or\ncosmic rays). However, these jets do not dominate in AGN feedback. If most jets\nare dominated by non-kinetic energies, they should be mainly mild jets. If most\njets are strong, they must be mainly dominated by the kinetic energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 02:51:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

Recent studies show that product reviews are a good source for\nreal-time, automatic product question answering (PQA). In the literature, PQA\nis formulated as a retrieval problem with the goal to search for the most\nrelevant reviews to answer a given product question. In this paper, we focus on\nthe issue of answerability and answer reliability for PQA using reviews. Our\ninvestigation is based on the intuition that many questions may not be\nanswerable with a finite set of reviews. When a question is not answerable, a\nsystem should return nil answers rather than providing a list of irrelevant\nreviews, which can have significant negative impact on user experience.\nMoreover, for answerable questions, only the most relevant reviews that answer\nthe question should be included in the result.

Based on\nthe observation that an oriented line and its neighboring pixels in an EPI\nshare a similar linear structure, we propose an end-to-end fully convolutional\nnetwork (FCN) to estimate the depth value of the intersection point on the\nhorizontal and vertical EPIs. Specifically, we present a new feature-extraction\nmodule, called Oriented Relation Module (ORM), that constructs the relationship\nbetween the line orientations. To facilitate training, we also propose a\nrefocusing-based data augmentation method to obtain different slopes from EPIs\nof the same scene point. Extensive experiments verify the efficacy of learning\nrelations and show that our approach is competitive to other state-of-the-art\nmethods. The code and the trained models are available at\nhttps://github.com/lkyahpu/EPI_ORM.git.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 03:39:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 07:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Integratable PLMG with a large output power of ~90\nnW and voltage of ~2.7 V has been demonstrated, meanwhile its small internal\nresistance of ~250 kilohm takes a huge advantage in resistance matching with\nthe impedance of electron components. The PLMG shows potential application\nvalue in the Internet of Things (IoTs) after proper miniaturization and\nintegration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 04:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 12:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

This shift has brought forth important challenges for a\nbidder: how should one bid in a first-price auction, where unlike in\nsecond-price auctions, it is no longer optimal to bid one's private value\ntruthfully and hard to know the others' bidding behaviors? In this paper, we\ntake an online learning angle and address the fundamental problem of learning\nto bid in repeated first-price auctions, where both the bidder's private\nvaluations and other bidders' bids can be arbitrary. We develop the first\nminimax optimal online bidding algorithm that achieves an\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret when competing with the set of all Lipschitz\nbidding policies, a strong oracle that contains a rich set of bidding\nstrategies. This novel algorithm is built on the insight that the presence of a\ngood expert can be leveraged to improve performance, as well as an original\nhierarchical expert-chaining structure, both of which could be of independent\ninterest in online learning. Further, by exploiting the product structure that\nexists in the problem, we modify this algorithm--in its vanilla form\nstatistically optimal but computationally infeasible--to a computationally\nefficient and space efficient algorithm that also retains the same\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ minimax optimal regret guarantee. Additionally,\nthrough an impossibility result, we highlight that one is unlikely to compete\nthis favorably with a stronger oracle (than the considered Lipschitz bidding\npolicies). Finally, we test our algorithm on three real-world first-price\nauction datasets obtained from Verizon Media and demonstrate our algorithm's\nsuperior performance compared to several existing bidding algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 05:40:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

In this paper, we\npropose an end-to-end deep neural video coding framework (NVC), which uses\nvariational autoencoders (VAEs) with joint spatial and temporal prior\naggregation (PA) to exploit the correlations in intra-frame pixels, inter-frame\nmotions and inter-frame compensation residuals, respectively. Novel features of\nNVC include: 1) To estimate and compensate motion over a large range of\nmagnitudes, we propose an unsupervised multiscale motion compensation network\n(MS-MCN) together with a pyramid decoder in the VAE for coding motion features\nthat generates multiscale flow fields, 2) we design a novel adaptive\nspatiotemporal context model for efficient entropy coding for motion\ninformation, 3) we adopt nonlocal attention modules (NLAM) at the bottlenecks\nof the VAEs for implicit adaptive feature extraction and activation, leveraging\nits high transformation capacity and unequal weighting with joint global and\nlocal information, and 4) we introduce multi-module optimization and a\nmulti-frame training strategy to minimize the temporal error propagation among\nP-frames. NVC is evaluated for the low-delay causal settings and compared with\nH.265/HEVC, H.264/AVC and the other learnt video compression methods following\nthe common test conditions, demonstrating consistent gains across all popular\ntest sequences for both PSNR and MS-SSIM distortion metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 06:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

Recent evidence in decision\nneuroscience has shown that the human brain has an innate capacity to resolve\nthese issues, leading to optimism regarding the development of\nneuroscience-inspired solutions toward sample-efficient, and generalizable RL\nalgorithms. We show that the computational model combining model-based and\nmodel-free control, which we term the prefrontal RL, reliably encodes the\ninformation of high-level policy that humans learned, and this model can\ngeneralize the learned policy to a wide range of tasks. First, we trained the\nprefrontal RL, and deep RL algorithms on 82 subjects' data, collected while\nhuman participants were performing two-stage Markov decision tasks, in which we\nmanipulated the goal, state-transition uncertainty and state-space complexity.\nIn the reliability test, which includes the latent behavior profile and the\nparameter recoverability test, we showed that the prefrontal RL reliably\nlearned the latent policies of the humans, while all the other models failed.\nSecond, to test the ability to generalize what these models learned from the\noriginal task, we situated them in the context of environmental volatility.\nSpecifically, we ran large-scale simulations with 10 Markov decision tasks, in\nwhich latent context variables change over time. Our information-theoretic\nanalysis showed that the prefrontal RL showed the highest level of adaptability\nand episodic encoding efficacy.

It works by smoothing the node features across the graph. The\ncurrent GCN models overwhelmingly assume that the node feature information is\ncomplete. However, real-world graph data are often incomplete and containing\nmissing features. Traditionally, people have to estimate and fill in the\nunknown features based on imputation techniques and then apply GCN. However,\nthe process of feature filling and graph learning are separated, resulting in\ndegraded and unstable performance. This problem becomes more serious when a\nlarge number of features are missing. We propose an approach that adapts GCN to\ngraphs containing missing features. In contrast to traditional strategy, our\napproach integrates the processing of missing features and graph learning\nwithin the same neural network architecture. Our idea is to represent the\nmissing data by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and calculate the expected\nactivation of neurons in the first hidden layer of GCN, while keeping the other\nlayers of the network unchanged. This enables us to learn the GMM parameters\nand network weight parameters in an end-to-end manner.

DeepSinger has several advantages over previous SVS systems: 1) to\nthe best of our knowledge, it is the first SVS system that directly mines\ntraining data from music websites, 2) the lyrics-to-singing alignment model\nfurther avoids any human efforts for alignment labeling and greatly reduces\nlabeling cost, 3) the singing model based on a feed-forward Transformer is\nsimple and efficient, by removing the complicated acoustic feature modeling in\nparametric synthesis and leveraging a reference encoder to capture the timbre\nof a singer from noisy singing data, and 4) it can synthesize singing voices in\nmultiple languages and multiple singers. We evaluate DeepSinger on our mined\nsinging dataset that consists of about 92 hours data from 89 singers on three\nlanguages (Chinese, Cantonese and English). The results demonstrate that with\nthe singing data purely mined from the Web, DeepSinger can synthesize\nhigh-quality singing voices in terms of both pitch accuracy and voice\nnaturalness (footnote: Our audio samples are shown in\nhttps://speechresearch.github.io/deepsinger/.)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 07:00:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 14:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-16"}

The best algorithms to solve these problems take\nexponential time in the worst case. The exponential time hypothesis (ETH)\nimplies that this result is tight for SAT, that is, SAT cannot be solved in\nsubexponential time. This immediately establishes that the result is also tight\nfor the consistency problem for ASP. However, accounting for the treewidth of\nthe problem, the consistency problem for ASP is slightly harder than SAT: while\nSAT can be solved by an algorithm that runs in exponential time in the\ntreewidth k, it was recently shown that ASP requires exponential time in k\n\\cdot log(k). This extra cost is due checking that there are no self-supported\ntrue atoms due to positive cycles in the program. In this paper, we refine the\nabove result and show that the consistency problem for ASP can be solved in\nexponential time in k \\cdot log({\\lambda}) where {\\lambda} is the minimum\nbetween the treewidth and the size of the largest strongly-connected component\nin the positive dependency graph of the program.

An example of an application of text\nmining in poetry is the usage of features derived from their individual words\nin order to capture the lexical, sublexical and interlexical meaning, and infer\nthe General Affective Meaning (GAM) of the text. However, even though this\nproposal has been proved as useful for poetry in some languages, there is a\nlack of studies for both Spanish poetry and for highly-structured poetic\ncompositions such as sonnets. This article presents a study over an annotated\ncorpus of Spanish sonnets, in order to analyse if it is possible to build\nfeatures from their individual words for predicting their GAM. The purpose of\nthis is to model sonnets at an affective level. The article also analyses the\nrelationship between the GAM of the sonnets and the content itself. For this,\nwe consider the content from a psychological perspective, identifying with tags\nwhen a sonnet is related to a specific term.

We reanalyzed the Fermi-LAT data on this region and compare it with\nnew radio observations from the MWISP survey. The modelling of the spectral\nenergy distribution from radio to GeV energies favors a hadronic origin of the\ngamma-ray emission and constrains the SNR magnetic field to be at least ~100\nuG. Despite the large magnetic field, the present acceleration of protons seems\nto be limited to ~10 GeV, which points to a drastic slow down of the shock\nvelocity due to the dense wall traced by the CO observations, surrounding the\nremnant. Further investigation of the gamma-ray spectral shape points to a\ndynamically old remnant subjected to severe escape of CRs and a decrease of\nacceleration efficiency.

We assume that a light scalar field is decoupled from matter and\noscillates harmonically around its vacuum expectation value. We include\nself-interactions and consider the nonrelativistic regime. The scalar dynamics\nare described by a fluid approach where the fluid pressure depends on both\nquantum and self-interaction effects. When the squared speed of sound of the\nscalar fluid becomes negative, an instability arises and the fluctuations of\nthe scalar energy-density field start growing. They eventually become nonlinear\nand clumps form. Subsequently, the clumps aggregate and reach a universal\nregime. Afterwards, they play the role of cold dark matter. We apply this\nmechanism first to a model with a negative quartic term stabilised by a\npositive self-interaction of order six, and then to axion monodromy, where a\nsubdominant cosine potential corrects a mass term. In the first case, the\nsquared speed of sound becomes negative when the quartic term dominates,\nleading to a tachyonic instability. For axion monodromy, the instability starts\nvery slowly after the squared speed of sound first becomes negative and then\noscillates around zero. Initially the density perturbations perform acoustic\noscillations due to the quantum pressure. Eventually, they start growing\nexponentially due to a parametric resonance.\n  In both scenarios, the scalar-field clumps span a wide range of scales and\nmasses, running from the size of atoms to that of galactic molecular clouds,\nand from $10^{-3} \\, {\\rm gram}$ to thousands of solar masses.

One of the ways to improve the quality of visual servo output is to\nimprove the accuracy of the CNN for estimating the relative pose estimation.\nWith a given state-of-the-art CNN for relative pose regression, how can we\nachieve an improved performance for visual servo control? In this paper, we\nexplore switching of CNNs to improve the precision of visual servo control. The\nidea of switching a CNN is due to the fact that the dataset for training a\nrelative camera pose regressor for visual servo control must contain variations\nin relative pose ranging from a very small scale to eventually a larger scale.\nWe found that, training two different instances of the CNN, one for\nlarge-scale-displacements (LSD) and another for small-scale-displacements (SSD)\nand switching them during the visual servo execution yields better results than\ntraining a single CNN with the combined LSD+SSD data. However, it causes extra\nstorage overhead and switching decision is taken by a manually set threshold\nwhich may not be optimal for all the scenes. To eliminate these drawbacks, we\npropose an efficient switching strategy based on model agnostic meta learning\n(MAML) algorithm.

Despite the good\nperformance, those methods have a few issues in nature, such as the poor\ntrade-off between accuracy and efficiency, and plain feature representation\nlearning with local convolutions. In this paper, a novel pixel-wise\nprediction-based method is proposed to address the above issues. The key ideas\nare two-fold: a) explicitly modeling the dependencies among joints and the\nrelations between the pixels and the joints for better local feature\nrepresentation learning; b) unifying the dense pixel-wise offset predictions\nand direct joint regression for end-to-end training. Specifically, we first\npropose a graph convolutional network (GCN) based joint graph reasoning module\nto model the complex dependencies among joints and augment the representation\ncapability of each pixel.

A significant challenge for audio captioning is the distribution of\nwords in the captions: some words are very frequent but acoustically\nnon-informative, i.e. the function words (e.g. \"a\", \"the\"), and other words are\ninfrequent but informative, i.e. the content words (e.g. adjectives, nouns).

While many physical observables are not\nsensitive to this fact, the identification of the precise gauge group becomes\ncrucial when the magnetic spectrum of the theory is considered. This question\nis addressed in the context of Coulomb branches for $3$d $\\mathcal{N}=4$ quiver\ngauge theories, which are moduli spaces of dressed monopole operators. Since\nmonopole operators are characterized by their magnetic charge, the\nidentification of the gauge group is imperative for the determination of the\nmagnetic lattice. It is well-known that the gauge group of unframed unitary\nquivers is the product of all unitary nodes in the quiver modded out by the\ndiagonal $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ acting trivially on the matter representation. This\nreasoning generalises to the notion that a choice of gauge group associated to\na quiver is given by the product of the individual nodes quotiented by any\nsubgroup that acts trivially on the matter content. For unframed (unitary-)\northosymplectic quivers composed of $\\mathrm{SO}(\\textrm{even})$,\n$\\mathrm{USp}$, and possibly $\\mathrm{U}$ gauge nodes, the maximal subgroup\nacting trivially is a diagonal $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. For unframed unitary quivers\nwith a single $\\mathrm{SU}(N)$ node it is $\\mathbb{Z}_N$. We use this notion to\ncompute the Coulomb branch Hilbert series of many unitary-orthosymplectic\nquivers. Examples include nilpotent orbit closures of the exceptional E-type\nalgebras and magnetic quivers that arise from brane physics. This includes\nHiggs branches of theories with 8 supercharges in dimensions $4$, $5$, and $6$.\nA crucial ingredient in the calculation of exact refined Hilbert series is the\nalternative construction of unframed magnetic quivers from resolved Slodowy\nslices, whose Hilbert series can be derived from Hall-Littlewood polynomials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 09:50:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 13:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods search for the\nglobal optimum by progressively (actively) learning a surrogate model of the\nobjective function along the search path. Bayesian optimization can be\naccelerated through multifidelity approaches which leverage multiple black-box\napproximations of the objective functions that can be computationally cheaper\nto evaluate, but still provide relevant information to the search task. Further\ncomputational benefits are offered by the availability of parallel and\ndistributed computing architectures whose optimal usage is an open opportunity\nwithin the context of active learning. This paper introduces the Resource Aware\nActive Learning (RAAL) strategy, a multifidelity Bayesian scheme to accelerate\nthe optimization of black box functions.

Recently Huang\nproposed one efficient method to train RBMs with binary synapses by using a\ncombination of gradient ascent and the message passing algorithm under the\nvariational inference framework. However, additional heuristic clipping\noperation is needed. In this technical note, inspired from Huang's work , we\npropose one alternative optimization method using the Bayesian learning rule,\nwhich is one natural gradient variational inference method. As opposed to\nHuang's method, we update the natural parameters of the variational symmetric\nBernoulli distribution rather than the expectation parameters. Since the\nnatural parameters take values in the entire real domain, no additional\nclipping is needed.

They can be described as stacking of AB5 and AB2 sub-units along\nthe c crystallographic axis. The latter sub-unit brings a larger capacity,\nwhile the former one provides a better cycling stability. However, ABy binaries\ndo not show good enough properties for applications. Upon hydrogenation, they\nexhibit multiplateau behavior and poor reversibility, attributed to H induced\namorphization. These drawbacks can be overcome by chemical substitutions on the\nA and/or the B sites leading to stabilized reversible hydrides. The present\nwork focuses on the pseudo-binary Sm2MnxNi7-x system (0 <= x < 0.5). The\nstructural, thermodynamic and corrosion properties are analyzed and interpreted\nby means of X-ray diffraction, chemical analysis, scanning electron microscopy,\nthermogravimetric analysis and magnetic measurements. Unexpected cell parameter\nvariations are reported and interpreted regarding possible formation of\nstructural defects and uneven Mn distribution within the Ni sublattice.\nReversible capacity is improved for x > 0.3 leading to larger and flatter\nisotherm curves, allowing for reversible capacity >1.4 wt %. Regarding\ncorrosion, the binary compound corrodes in alkaline medium to form rare earth\nhydroxide and nanoporous nickel. As for the Mn-substituted compounds, a new\ncorrosion product is formed in addition to those above mentioned, as manganese\ninitiates a sacrificial anode mechanism taking place at the early corrosion\nstage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 10:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

The external jet aerodynamics and internal wall pressure field\nare first shown to be clearly linked, but only at this frequency peak for which\na significant coherence emerges between first azimuthal mode of fluctuating\nwall pressure and first azimuthal mode of fluctuating external velocity field.\nA Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation is carried out and validated against\nexperimental results in order to reproduce this tonal flow dynamics.

The analysis shows that both waves\npossess support in the jet core and have a non negligible pressure signature in\nthe separated region.

Several physical mechanisms may\nproduce this bimodality. The most favored candidate mechanisms are two distinct\nsupernova channels or different accretion modes of the neutron stars in\nBe/X-ray binaries. Investigating the kinematics of these systems may provide\nsome additional insight into the physics of this bimodality. If the two\nBe/X-ray binary subpopulations arise from two distinct supernova types, then\nthe two subpopulations should have different peculiar (systemic) velocities.\nThis can be tested either directly, by measuring the velocity of the system, or\nindirectly, by measuring the position of the system with respect to its\nbirthplace. Using the most recent Gaia dataset and the newest catalogs of Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC) star clusters, we analyzed the tangential peculiar\nvelocities of Be/X-ray binaries in the Galaxy and the positions of Be/X-ray\nbinaries in the SMC. We used the distance of the system from the nearest young\nstar cluster as a proxy to the tangential velocity of the system.

Evaporative (sublimation) cooling of icy interstellar grains occurs\nwhen the grains have been suddenly heated by a cosmic-ray (CR) particle or\nother process. It results in thermal desorption of icy species, affecting the\nchemical composition of interstellar clouds. Aims. We investigate details on\nsublimation cooling, obtaining necessary knowledge before this process is\nconsidered in astrochemical models. Methods. We employed a numerical code that\ndescribes the sublimation of molecules from an icy grain, layer by layer, also\nconsidering a limited diffusion of bulk-ice molecules toward the surface before\nthey sublimate. We studied a grain, suddenly heated to peak temperature T,\nwhich cools via sublimation and radiation. Results. A number of questions were\nanswered. The choice of grain heat capacity C has a limited effect on the\nnumber of sublimated molecules N, if the grain temperature T > 40K. For grains\nwith different sizes, CR-induced desorption is most efficient for rather small\ngrains with a core radius of a ~ 0.02 micron. CR-induced sublimation of CO2 ice\ncan occur only from small grains if their peak temperature is T > 80K and there\nis a lack of other volatiles. The presence of H2 molecules on grain surface\nhastens their cooling and thus significantly reduces N for other sublimated\nmolecules for T < 30K. Finally, if there is no diffusion and subsequent\nsublimation of bulk-ice molecules (i.e., sublimation occurs only from the\nsurface layer), sublimation yields do not exceed 1-2 monolayers and, if T >\n50K, N does not increase with increasing T. Conclusions. Important details\nregarding the sublimation cooling of icy interstellar grains were clarified,\nwhich will enable a proper consideration of this process in astrochemical\nmodeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 11:44:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Recognizing that\ndelamination emerges through a subcritical bifurcation from a planar, uniformly\ncompressed state, we predict that the dependence of the threshold confinement\nlevel on the extensibility and bendability of the sheet, as well as the\ndelaminated shape at threshold, varies markedly between two asymptotic regimes\nof these parameters. For sheets whose bendability is sufficiently high the\ndelaminated shape is a large-slope \"fold\", where the amplitude is proportional\nto the imposed confinement. In contrast, for lower values of the bendability\nparameter the delaminated shape is a small-slope \"ruck\", whose amplitude\nincreases more moderately upon increasing confinement.

However, the\nexcitation of these plasmonic modes by direct illumination is forbidden by\nenergy/momentum conservation rules. One strategy to overcome this limitation\nrelies on diffraction gratings to match the wavevector of the incoming photons\nwith that of propagating SPP excitations. The main limit of the approaches so\nfar reported in literature is that they rely on highly ordered diffraction\ngratings fabricated by means of demanding nano-lithographic processes. In this\nwork we demonstrate that an innovative, fully self-organized method based on\nwrinkling-assisted Ion Beam Sputtering can be exploited to fabricate large area\n(cm^2 scale) nano-rippled soda-lime templates which conformally support\nultrathin Au films deposited by physical deposition. The self-organized\npatterns act as quasi-1D gratings characterized by a remarkably high spatial\norder which matches properly the transverse photon coherence length. The\ngratings can thus enable the excitation of hybrid SPP modes confined at the\nAu/dielectric interfaces, with a resonant wavelength which can be tuned either\nby modifying the grating period, photon incidence angle or, potentially, the\nchoice of the thin film conductive material. Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering\nexperiments show promising gains in the range of 10^3 which are competitive,\neven before a systematic optimization of the sample fabrication parameters,\nwith state-of-the art lithographic systems, demonstrating the potential of such\ntemplates for a broad range of optoelectronic applications aiming at\nplasmon-enhanced photon harvesting for molecular or bio-sensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 12:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

These particle orbits show some depleted directions,\nespecially at high magnetic inclination with respect to the rotation axis for\npositive charges and at low inclination for negative charges because of\nsymmetry. Other directions are preferred and loaded with a high density of\nparticles, some directions concentrating the highest or lowest acceleration\nefficiencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 13:38:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Multiple characterization techniques are employed to\nexplore the structural and chemical quality of these films, the electrical and\noptical properties, and the device functionalities. The 80-nm thick Ti3AlC2\nfilm is highly conducting at room temperature (resistivity of 50 micro ohm-cm),\nand a very-low-temperature coefficient of resistivity. The ultrathin (2 nm)\nTi3AlC2 film has fairly good optical transparency and high conductivity at room\ntemperature (sheet resistance of 735 ohm). Scanning tunneling microscopy\nreveals the metallic characteristics (with finite density of states at the\nFermi level) at room temperature. The metal-semiconductor junction of the\np-type Ti3AlC2 film and n-Si show the expected rectification (diode)\ncharacteristics, in contrast to the ohmic contact behavior in the case of\nTi3AlC2 on p-Si. A triboelectric-nanogenerator-based touch-sensing device,\ncomprising of the Ti3AlC2 film, shows a very impressive peak-to-peak\nopen-circuit output voltage of 80 V. These observations reveal that pulsed\nlaser deposited Ti3AlC2 thin films have excellent potential for applications in\nmultiple domains, such as bottom electrodes, resistors for high-precision\nmeasurements, Schottky diodes, ohmic contacts, fairly transparent ultrathin\nconductors, and next-generation biomechanical touch sensors for energy\nharvesting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 13:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

The majority of these galaxies\nshow collimated relativistic outflows known as jets, that extend over hundreds\nof thousands of parsecs for the most powerful sources. Accretion of matter onto\nthe central super-massive black hole is believed to fuel these jets and power\ntheir emission, with the radio emission being related to the synchrotron\nradiation of relativistic electrons in magnetic fields. The origin of the\nextended X-ray emission seen in the kiloparsec-scale jets from these sources is\nstill a matter of debate, although Cen A's X-ray emission has been suggested to\noriginate in electron synchrotron processes. The other possible explanation is\nInverse Compton (IC) scattering with CMB soft photons. Synchrotron radiation\nneeds ultra-relativistic electrons ($\\sim50$ TeV), and given their short\ncooling times, requires some continuous re-acceleration mechanism to be active.\nIC scattering, on the other hand, does not require very energetic electrons,\nbut requires jets that stay highly relativistic on large scales ($\\geq$1 Mpc)\nand that remain well-aligned with the line of sight. Some recent evidence\ndisfavours inverse Compton-CMB models, although other evidence seems to be\ncompatible with them. In principle, the detection of extended gamma-ray\nemission, directly probing the presence of ultra-relativistic electrons, could\ndistinguish between these options, but instruments have hitherto been unable to\nresolve the relevant structures. At GeV energies there is also an unusual\nspectral hardening in Cen A, whose explanation is unclear. Here we report\nobservations of Cen A at TeV energies that resolve its large-scale jet. We\ninterpret the data as evidence for the acceleration of ultra-relativistic\nelectrons in the jet, and favour the synchrotron explanation for the X-rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 14:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

Meanwhile, both the response rate and quality of the\nsurvey are usually poor.

Therefore, we aim to explore\nthe following questions: Can we measure the multiple dimensions of high school\nstudent's learning engagement including emotional, behavioural and cognitive\nengagement with sensing data in the wild? Can we derive the activity,\nphysiological, and environmental factors contributing to the different\ndimensions of student engagement? If yes, which sensors are the most useful in\ndifferentiating each dimension of the engagement?

Health data sharing is dependent on obtaining individual\nconsent which, in turn, is hindered by a lack of resources. To this extend,\nblockchain-based platforms facilitate data sharing by inherently creating a\ntrusted distributed network of users. These users are enabled to share their\ndata without depending on the time and resources of specific players (such as\nthe health services). In blockchain-based platforms, data governance mechanisms\nbecome very important due to the need to specify and monitor data sharing and\ndata use conditions. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based data sharing\nconsent model for access control over individual health data. We use smart\ncontracts to dynamically represent the individual consent over health data and\nto enable data requesters to search and access them.

We deploy the model on\nEthereum blockchain and evaluate different data sharing scenarios. The\ncontribution of this paper is to create an individual consent model for health\ndata sharing platforms.

We present\nresults on the time dependence of average mass of the clusters and that of\naverage kinetic energy, obtained via event driven molecular dynamics\nsimulations, for a wide range of values for the coefficient of restitution\n($e$), by fixing the overall density of particles in the system to a constant\nnumber.

To tackle the above limitations, for the first time, this\nwork incorporates a new family of generative models (i.e., flow-based models)\ninto ZSL. The proposed Invertible Zero-shot Flow (IZF) learns factorized data\nembeddings (i.e., the semantic factors and the non-semantic ones) with the\nforward pass of an invertible flow network, while the reverse pass generates\ndata samples. This procedure theoretically extends conventional generative\nflows to a factorized conditional scheme. To explicitly solve the bias problem,\nour model enlarges the seen-unseen distributional discrepancy based on negative\nsample-based distance measurement. Notably, IZF works flexibly with either a\nnaive Bayesian classifier or a held-out trainable one for zero-shot\nrecognition. Experiments on widely-adopted ZSL benchmarks demonstrate the\nsignificant performance gain of IZF over existing methods, in both classic and\ngeneralized settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 15:21:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

What then are the naturally emerging\norganizing principles of complex-system stability? Encoded within the system's\nstability matrix, the Jacobian, the answer is obscured by the scale and\ndiversity of the relevant systems, their broad parameter space, and their\nnonlinear interaction mechanisms. To make advances, here we uncover emergent\npatterns in the structure of the Jacobian, rooted in the interplay between the\nnetwork topology and the system's intrinsic nonlinear dynamics. These patterns\nhelp us analytically identify the few relevant control parameters that\ndetermine a system's dynamic stability. Complex systems, we find, exhibit\ndiscrete stability classes, from asymptotically unstable, where stability is\nunattainable, to sensitive, in which stability abides within a bounded range of\nthe system's parameters. Most crucially, alongside these two classes, we\nuncover a third class, asymptotically stable, in which a sufficiently large and\nheterogeneous network acquires a guaranteed stability, independent of\nparameters, and therefore insensitive to external perturbation. Hence, two of\nthe most ubiquitous characteristics of real-world networks - scale and\nheterogeneity - emerge as natural organizing principles to ensure stability in\nthe face of changing environmental conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 15:48:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2020 14:11:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 20:21:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 09:08:04 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 15 May 2021 20:28:50 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2023 10:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

The first method relies on the normal form theory that\nallows one to obtain a nonlinear change of coordinates for expressing the\nreduced-order dynamics in an invariant-based span of the phase space. The\nsecond method is the modal derivative (MD) approach, and more specifically the\nquadratic manifold defined in order to derive a second-order nonlinear change\nof coordinates. Both methods share a common point of view, willing to introduce\na nonlinear mapping to better define a reduced order model that could take more\nproperly into account the nonlinear restoring forces. However the calculation\nmethods are different and the quadratic manifold approach has not the\ninvariance property embedded in its definition. Modal derivatives and static\nmodal derivatives are investigated, and their distinctive features in the\ntreatment of the quadratic nonlinearity is underlined. Assuming a slow/fast\ndecomposition allows understanding how the three methods tend to share\nequivalent properties. While they give proper estimations for flat symmetric\nstructures having a specific shape of nonlinearities and a clear slow/fast\ndecomposition between flexural and in-plane modes, the treatment of the\nquadratic nonlinearity makes the predictions different in the case of curved\nstructures such as arches and shells.

The design of\nlattices for BF channels offers a challenging problem, which differs greatly\nfrom its counterparts like AWGN channels. Recently, the original binary\nConstruction A for lattices, due to Forney, has been generalized to a lattice\nconstruction from totally real and complex multiplication (CM) fields. This\ngeneralized algebraic Construction A of lattices provides signal space\ndiversity, intrinsically, which is the main requirement for the signal sets\ndesigned for fading channels. In this paper, we construct full-diversity\nalgebraic lattices for BF channels using Construction A over totally real\nnumber fields. We propose two new decoding methods for these lattices which\nhave complexity that grows linearly in the dimension of the lattice. The first\ndecoder is proposed for generalized Construction A lattices with a binary LDPC\ncode as underlying code. This decoding method contains iterative and\nnon-iterative phases. In order to implement the iterative phase, we propose the\ndefinition of a parity-check matrix and Tanner graph for Construction A\nlattices. We also prove that using an underlying LDPC code that achieves the\noutage probability limit over one-BF channel, the constructed algebraic LDPC\nlattices together with the proposed decoding method admit diversity order n.\nThen, we modify the proposed algorithm by removing its iterative phase which\nenables full-diversity practical decoding of all generalized Construction A\nlattices without any assumption about their underlying code.

We start by applying a strong search\nalgorithm (in particular, simulated annealing) towards a heuristically defined\nobjective that (roughly) estimates the quality of sentences. Then, a\nconditional generative model learns from the search results, and meanwhile\nsmooth out the noise of search. The alternation between search and learning can\nbe repeated for performance bootstrapping. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nTGLS on two real-world natural language generation tasks, paraphrase generation\nand text formalization. Our model significantly outperforms unsupervised\nbaseline methods in both tasks. Especially, it achieves comparable performance\nwith the state-of-the-art supervised methods in paraphrase generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 04:34:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

The work shows that the dark matter-induced\nnoise is not spatially white and owns a well defined correlation function with\nthe intrinsic vacuum physical length given by the De Broglie one. The resulting\nmodel, in the case of microscopic systems, whose dimension is much smaller than\nthe De Broglie length, leads to the Langevin-Schrodinger equation whose\nfriction coefficient is not constant.

Understanding the structure and dynamics of\nsuch networks entails creating a smaller representative network that preserves\nits relevant topological and dynamical properties. While modern machine\nlearning methods have enabled identification of governing laws for complex\ndynamical systems, their inability to produce white-box models with sufficient\nphysical interpretation renders such methods undesirable to domain experts. In\nthis paper, we introduce a hybrid black-box, white-box approach for the sparse\nidentification of the governing laws for complex, highly coupled dynamical\nsystems with particular emphasis on finding the influential reactions in\nchemical reaction networks for combustion applications, using a data-driven\nsparse-learning technique. The proposed approach identifies a set of\ninfluential reactions using species concentrations and reaction rates,with\nminimal computational cost without requiring additional data or simulations.\nThe new approach is applied to analyze the combustion chemistry of H2 and C3H8\nin a constant-volume homogeneous reactor. The influential reactions determined\nby the sparse-learning method are consistent with the current kinetics\nknowledge of chemical mechanisms. Additionally, we show that a reduced version\nof the parent mechanism can be generated as a combination of the significantly\nreduced influential reactions identified at different times and conditions and\nthat for both H2 and C3H8 fuel, the reduced mechanisms perform closely to the\nparent mechanisms as a function of the ignition delay time over a wide range of\nconditions. Our results demonstrate the potential of the sparse-learning\napproach as an effective and efficient tool for dynamical system analysis and\nreduction. The uniqueness of this approach as applied to combustion systems\nlies in the ability to identify influential reactions in specified conditions\nand times during the evolution of the combustion process. This ability is of\ngreat interest to understand chemical reaction systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 21:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}
