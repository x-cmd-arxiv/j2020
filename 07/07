Adv. '17).\nRecently, several groups have independently discovered that the weak\nformulation provides orders of magnitude better robustness to noise. Here we\nextend our Weak SINDy (WSINDy) framework introduced in (arXiv:2005.04339) to\nthe setting of partial differential equations (PDEs). The elimination of\npointwise derivative approximations via the weak form enables effective\nmachine-precision recovery of model coefficients from noise-free data (i.e.\nbelow the tolerance of the simulation scheme) as well as robust identification\nof PDEs in the large noise regime (with signal-to-noise ratio approaching one\nin many well-known cases). This is accomplished by discretizing a convolutional\nweak form of the PDE and exploiting separability of test functions for\nefficient model identification using the Fast Fourier Transform. The resulting\nWSINDy algorithm for PDEs has a worst-case computational complexity of\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^{D+1}\\log(N))$ for datasets with $N$ points in each of $D+1$\ndimensions (i.e. $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(N))$ operations per datapoint). Furthermore,\nour Fourier-based implementation reveals a connection between robustness to\nnoise and the spectra of test functions, which we utilize in an \\textit{a\npriori} selection algorithm for test functions. Finally, we introduce a\nlearning algorithm for the threshold in sequential-thresholding least-squares\n(STLS) that enables model identification from large libraries, and we utilize\nscale-invariance at the continuum level to identify PDEs from poorly-scaled\ndatasets. We demonstrate WSINDy's robustness, speed and accuracy on several\nchallenging PDEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 16:03:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 21:34:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 17:26:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

One central problem in the field is to find\nsuitable approximations of the dynamics as the number of nodes/vertices tends\nto infinity, i.e., in the large graph limit. A cornerstone in this context are\nVlasov-Fokker-Planck equations (VFPEs) describing a particle density on a\nmean-field level. For all-to-all coupled systems, it is quite classical to\nprove the rigorous approximation by VFPEs for many classes of particle systems.\nFor dense graphs converging to graphon limits, one also knows that mean-field\napproximation holds for certain classes of models, e.g., for the Kuramoto model\non graphs. Yet, the space of intermediate density and sparse graphs is clearly\nextremely relevant. Here we prove that the Kuramoto model can be be\napproximated in the mean-field limit by far more general graph limits than\ngraphons. In particular, our contributions are as follows. (I) We show, how to\nintroduce operator theory more abstractly into VFPEs by considering graphops.\nGraphops have recently been proposed as a unifying approach to graph limit\ntheory, and here we show that they can be used for differential equations on\ngraphs.

(III) This mean-field\nVFPE involves a graphop, and we prove the existence, uniqueness, and continuous\ngraphop-dependence of weak solutions. (IV) On a technical level, our results\nrely on designing a new suitable metric of graphop convergence and on employing\nFourier analysis on compact abelian groups to approximate graphops using\nsummability kernels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 16:34:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 17:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

Thus,\nit is of much interest to generate alternative approaches or representations\naimed at allowing us a better understanding of the physics involved in the\nprocess from different perspectives. With this purpose, here an approach based\non graph theory is introduced and discussed in the context of some\napplications. Its main goal is to provide a fully symbolic framework for\nquantum teleportation from a dynamical viewpoint, which makes explicit at each\nstage of the process how entanglement and information swap among the qubits\ninvolved in it. In order to construct this dynamical perspective, it has been\nnecessary to define some auxiliary elements, namely virtual nodes and edges, as\nwell as an additional notation for nodes describing potential states (against\nnodes accounting for actual states). With these elements, not only the flow of\nthe process can be followed step by step, but they allow us to establish a\ndirect correspondence between this graph-based approach and the usual state\nvector description. To show the suitability and versatility of this graph-based\napproach, several particular teleportation examples are examined, which include\nbipartite, tripartite and tetrapartite maximally entangled states as quantum\nchannels. From the analysis of these cases, a general protocol is discussed in\nthe case of sharing a maximally entangled multi-qubit system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 16:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

A fundamental limitation\nof HMDs is, that the user itself cannot be augmented conveniently as, in casual\nposture, only the distal upper extremities are within the field of view of the\nHMD. Consequently, most MR applications that are centered around the user, such\nas virtual dressing rooms or learning of body movements, cannot be realized\nwith HMDs. In this paper, we propose a novel concept and prototype system that\ncombines OST HMDs and physical mirrors to enable self-augmentation and provide\nan immersive MR environment centered around the user. Our system, to the best\nof our knowledge the first of its kind, estimates the user's pose in the\nvirtual image generated by the mirror using an RGBD camera attached to the HMD\nand anchors virtual objects to the reflection rather than the user directly. We\nevaluate our system quantitatively with respect to calibration accuracy and\ninfrared signal degradation effects due to the mirror, and show its potential\nin applications where large mirrors are already an integral part of the\nfacility.

In contrast to\ncompeting devices such as LCD-equipped smart mirrors, the proposed system\nconsists of only an HMD with RGBD camera and, thus, does not require a prepared\nenvironment making it very flexible and generic.

For this reason, a large literature in machine\nlearning speaks of a fairness tradeoff between these two measures. This framing\nassumes that both measures are, in fact, capturing something important. To\ndate, philosophers have not examined this crucial assumption, and examined to\nwhat extent each measure actually tracks a normatively important property.

These are amongst the largest known\nglitches (17 of them have sizes $\\Delta\\nu/\\nu\\geq10^{-6}$) and exhibit very\nsimilar characteristics. This similarity, combined with the regularity with\nwhich large glitches occur, has turned Vela into an archetype of this type of\nglitching behaviour. The properties of its smallest glitches, on the other\nhand, are not clearly established. High-cadence observations of the Vela pulsar\nwere taken between 1981 and 2005 at the Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory.

The Vela\npulsar presents an under-abundance of small glitches compared to many other\nglitching pulsars, which appears genuine and not a result of observational\nbiases.

Exposures with a high background were\ndiscarded, which was determined through a statistical analysis of all exposures\nin each instrument configuration. The X-ray background maps used in source\ndetection were modelled via adaptive smoothing with newly determined\nparameters. Source fluxes were derived for all contributing observations,\nirrespective of whether the source would be detectable in an individual\nobservation.\n  From 1,329 stacks with 6,604 contributing observations over repeatedly\ncovered 300 square degrees in the sky, 4XMM-DR9s lists 288,191 sources. 218,283\nof them were observed several times. Most stacks are composed of two\nobservations, the largest one comprises 352. The number of observations of a\nsource ranges from 1 to 40. Auxiliary products like X-ray images, long-term\nlight curves, and optical finding charts are published as well. 4XMM-DR9s is\nconsidered a prime resource to explore long-term variability of X-ray sources\ndiscovered by XMM-Newton. Regular incremental releases including new public\nobservations are planned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 17:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

The dynamics of particles and\ntilts are coupled through local update rules, and are known to lead to\ndifferent ordered and disordered steady state phases depending on the\nmicroscopic rates. We introduce a generalized balance mechanism in\nnon-equilibrium systems, namely $bunchwise~balance$, in which incoming and\noutgoing transition currents are balanced between groups of configurations.\nThis allows us to exactly determine the steady state in a subspace of the phase\ndiagram of this model. We introduce the concept of $irreducible~sequences$ of\ninterfaces and bends in this model.

Typically, disassembly is not robust enough to handle product\nvarieties from different shapes, models, and physical uncertainties due to\ncomponent imperfections, damage throughout component usage, or insufficient\nproduct information. To overcome these difficulties and to automate the\ndisassembly procedure through human-robot collaboration without excessive\ncomputational cost, this paper proposes a real-time receding horizon sequence\nplanner that distributes tasks between robot and human operator while taking\nreal-time human motion into consideration. The sequence planner aims to address\nseveral issues in the disassembly line, such as varying orientations, safety\nconstraints of human operators, uncertainty of human operation, and the\ncomputational cost of large number of disassembly tasks. The proposed\ndisassembly sequence planner identifies both the positions and orientations of\nthe to-be-disassembled items, as well as the locations of human operator, and\nobtains an optimal disassembly sequence that follows disassembly rules and\nsafety constraints for human operation. Experimental tests have been conducted\nto validate the proposed planner: the robot can locate and disassemble the\ncomponents following the optimal sequence, and consider explicitly human\noperator's real-time motion, and collaborate with the human operator without\nviolating safety constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 18:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

Extrapolated to amounts of\nGLA observed on individual comets and assuming a monotonic impact rate in the\nfirst billion years of solar system history, these experimental results show\nthat up to 10^23 kg of cometary GLA could have survived impact delivery, with\nsubstantial amounts of threose, erythrose, glycolic acid, and ethylene glycol\nalso produced or delivered. Importantly, independent of the profile of the\nimpact flux in the early solar system, comet delivery of GLA would have\nprovided (and may continue to provide) a reservoir of starting material for the\nformose reaction (to form ribose) and the Strecker reaction (to form amino\nacids). Thus, comets may have been important delivery vehicles for starting\nmolecules necessary for life as we know it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 18:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

This note examines the dataset and explains an issue of\nincorrect data added to the dataset. Findings suggest that this issue can be\nattributed to systemic errors in the data collection process. The results\nsuggest that the use of unverified open datasets can be problematic, although\nthe discoveries presented in this work may not be significant enough to\nchallenge all published research that used the IA dataset. Additionally,\nfindings indicate that the incorrect data happens because of a new feature\nimplemented by Airbnb. Thus, unless changes are made, it is likely that the\nconsequences of this issue will only become more severe. Finally, this note\nexplores why reproducibility is a problem when two different releases of the\ndataset are compared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 19:06:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 06:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Parsing such addresses is challenging\nbecause of a lack of inherent structure or hierarchy. It is imperative to\nunderstand the language of addresses, so that shipments can be routed without\ndelays. In this paper, we propose a novel approach towards understanding\ncustomer addresses by deriving motivation from recent advances in Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP). We also formulate different pre-processing steps for\naddresses using a combination of edit distance and phonetic algorithms. Then we\napproach the task of creating vector representations for addresses using\nWord2Vec with TF-IDF, Bi-LSTM and BERT based approaches. We compare these\napproaches with respect to sub-region classification task for North and South\nIndian cities. Through experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of\ngeneralized RoBERTa model, pre-trained over a large address corpus for language\nmodelling task. Our proposed RoBERTa model achieves a classification accuracy\nof around 90% with minimal text preprocessing for sub-region classification\ntask outperforming all other approaches. Once pre-trained, the RoBERTa model\ncan be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks in supply chain like pincode\nsuggestion and geo-coding. The model generalizes well for such tasks even with\nlimited labelled data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of its\nkind research proposing a novel approach of understanding customer addresses in\ne-commerce domain by pre-training language models and fine-tuning them for\ndifferent purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 19:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

While the inclusion of intermittent RES coupled\nwith the wide-scale deployment of communication and sensing devices is\nimportant towards a fully smart grid, it has also expanded the cyber-threat\nlandscape, effectively making power systems vulnerable to cyberattacks.

The work takes into consideration the\nintermittent generation of RES, vulnerabilities introduced by\nmicroprocessor-based electronic information and operational technology (IT/OT)\ndevices, and contingency analysis results. The proposed approach utilizes deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) and an adapted Common Vulnerability Scoring System\n(CVSS) score tailored to assess vulnerabilities in EPS in order to identify the\noptimal attack transition policy based on N-2 contingency results, i.e., the\nsimultaneous failure of two system elements.

We seek algorithms that allow the client\nto verify a purported proof sent by the cloud service that the work done in the\ncloud is correct. A line of work starting with Chakrabarti et al. (ICALP 2009)\nhas provided such algorithms, which we call schemes, for several statistical\nand graph-theoretic problems, many of which exhibit a tradeoff between the\nlength of the proof and the space used by the streaming verifier.\n  This work designs new schemes for a number of basic graph\nproblems---including triangle counting, maximum matching, topological sorting,\nand single-source shortest paths---where past work had either failed to obtain\nsmooth tradeoffs between these two key complexity measures or only obtained\nsuboptimal tradeoffs. Our key innovation is having the verifier compute certain\nnonlinear sketches of the input stream, leading to either new or improved\ntradeoffs. In many cases, our schemes in fact provide optimal tradeoffs up to\nlogarithmic factors.\n  Specifically, for most graph problems that we study, it is known that the\nproduct of the verifier's space cost $v$ and the proof length $h$ must be at\nleast $\\Omega(n^2)$ for $n$-vertex graphs. However, matching upper bounds are\nonly known for a handful of settings of $h$ and $v$ on the curve $h \\cdot\nv=\\tilde{\\Theta}(n^2)$.

In this work, we propose to\nhandle real-world SR by splitting this ill-posed problem into two comparatively\nmore well-posed steps. First, we train a network to transform real LR images to\nthe space of bicubically downsampled images in a supervised manner, by using\nboth real LR/HR pairs and synthetic pairs. Second, we take a generic SR network\ntrained on bicubically downsampled images to super-resolve the transformed LR\nimage. The first step of the pipeline addresses the problem by registering the\nlarge variety of degraded images to a common, well understood space of images.\nThe second step then leverages the already impressive performance of SR on\nbicubically downsampled images, sidestepping the issues of end-to-end training\non datasets with many different image degradations. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method by comparing it to recent methods in\nreal-world SR and show that our proposed approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art works in terms of both qualitative and quantitative results,\nas well as results of an extensive user study conducted on several real image\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 20:27:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 18:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-06"}

Stein\nVariational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is a deterministic sampling algorithm that\niteratively transports a set of particles to approximate a given distribution,\nbased on functional gradient descent that decreases the KL divergence. SVGD has\npromising results on several Bayesian inference applications. However, applying\nSVGD on high dimensional problems is still under-explored.

We propose\nnoise conditional kernel SVGD (NCK-SVGD), that works in tandem with the\nrecently introduced Noise Conditional Score Network estimator. NCK is crucial\nfor successful inference with SVGD in high dimension, as it adapts the kernel\nto the noise level of the score estimate. As we anneal the noise, NCK-SVGD\ntargets the real data distribution. We then extend the annealed SVGD with an\nentropic regularization. We show that this offers a flexible control between\nsample quality and diversity, and verify it empirically by precision and recall\nevaluations. The NCK-SVGD produces samples comparable to GANs and annealed SGLD\non computer vision benchmarks, including MNIST and CIFAR-10.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 21:26:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

The coupled nonlinear system is commonly solved by the fully-implicit\nscheme. Various compositional formulations have been proposed. However, severe\nconvergence issues of Newton solvers can arise under the conventional\nformulations. Crossing phase boundaries produces kinks in discretized\nequations, and subsequently causing oscillations or even divergence of Newton\niterations. The objective of this work is to develop a smooth formulation that\nremoves all the property switches and discontinuities associated with phase\nchanges. We show that it can be very difficult and costly to smooth the\nconservation equations directly. Therefore, we first reformulate the coupled\nsystem, so that the discontinuities are transferred to the phase equilibrium\nmodel. In this way a single and concise non-smooth equation is achieved and\nthen a smoothing approximation can be made. The new formulation with a\nsmoothing parameter provides smooth transitions of variables across all the\nphase regimes.

We evaluate the efficiency of\nthe new smooth formulation and the continuation method using several complex\nproblems.

We illustrate the use of this new\nalgorithm in a series of applications involving randomization of periodic\nornaments, images generated by two-dimensional fractional Brownian motion and\nthe Ising model, and a data set of natural textures. These examples show that\nmeasures obtained from ordinal networks (such as average shortest path and\nglobal node entropy) extract important image properties related to roughness\nand symmetry, are robust against noise, and can achieve higher accuracy than\ntraditional texture descriptors extracted from gray-level co-occurrence\nmatrices in simple image classification tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 22:03:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 00:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

A nontrivial interaction arises between the hydrodynamics\nand the electric field in the annulus, resulting in the formation of\nelectrocapillary waves. The main objective of the present study is to describe\nnonlinear aspects of such axisymmetric waves in the weakly nonlinear regime\nwhich is valid for long waves relative to the undisturbed jet radius. This is\nfound to be possible if two conditions hold: the outer electrode radius is not\ntoo small, and the applied electric field is sufficiently strong.

On clinical systems, beamforming is accomplished with the\ndelay-and-sum (DAS) algorithm. DAS is efficient but fails in patients with high\nnoise levels, so various adaptive beamformers have been proposed. Recently,\ndeep learning methods have been developed for this task. With deep learning\nmethods, beamforming is typically framed as a regression problem, where clean,\nground-truth data is known, and usually simulated.

From this perspective, multitasking\nfailures might reflect a preference for learning efficiency over multitasking\ncapability.

However, these methods can not\neffectively remove most of EMG artifacts. Here, we proposed a modified ICA\nmodel for EMG artifacts removal in the EEG, which is called EMG Removal by\nAdding Sources of EMG (ERASE). In this new approach, additional channels of\nreal EMG from neck and head muscles (reference artifacts) were added as inputs\nto ICA in order to \"force\" the most power from EMG artifacts into a few\nindependent components (ICs). The ICs containing EMG artifacts (the \"artifact\nICs\") were identified and rejected using an automated procedure. Simulation\nresults showed ERASE removed EMG artifacts from EEG significantly more\neffectively than conventional ICA. Subsequently, EEG was collected from 8\nhealthy participants while they moved their hands to test the realistic\nefficacy of this approach. Results showed that ERASE successfully removed EMG\nartifacts (on average, about 75% of EMG artifacts were removed when using real\nEMGs as reference artifacts) while preserving the expected EEG features related\nto movement. We also tested the ERASE procedure using simulated EMGs as\nreference artifacts (about 63% of EMG artifacts removed). Compared to\nconventional ICA, ERASE removed on average 26% more EMG artifacts from EEG.\nThese results indicate that using additional real or simulated EMG sources can\nincrease the effectiveness of ICA in removing EMG artifacts from EEG. Combined\nwith automated artifact IC rejection, ERASE also minimizes potential user bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 23:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

The resulting prioritized restreaming algorithms employ a constraint\nmanagement strategy based on multiplicative weights, borrowed from the\nrestreaming literature, while adopting notions of priority from balanced label\npropagation to optimize the ordering of the streaming process.

The effect of the tube wall corrugation is taken into\naccount in the model, which allows the access of the interaction between the\nwall shape and the thread interfacial dynamics. The linearized system is\nstudied by the Floquet theory due to the presence of non-constant coefficients\nin the equation and the spectrum is computed numerically via the\nFourier-Floquet-Hill method. The resulting features agree qualitatively with\nthose obtained based on a lubrication model in the thin annulus limit, where\nthe short-wave disturbances that would be stabilizing owing to the capillarity\nin the absence of wall corrugation, can excite some unstable long waves.

In this paper, a\nmin-max-min, hybrid, stochastic-robust investment planning model is proposed to\nobtain a resilient MG considering both High-Impact-Low-Frequency (HILF) and\nLow-Impact-High-Frequency (LIHF) uncertainties. The HILF uncertainty pertains\nto the unscheduled islanding of the MG after a disastrous event, and the LIHF\nuncertainty relates to correlated loads and DER generation, characterized by a\nset of scenarios.

Point-like scatterers randomly distributed throughout the sample\nserve as local probes of the downstream transmit-beam phase shifts caused by\naberrating structures within the sample. Phase shifts are monitored in a\ndifferential manner, providing signatures of transverse gradients of the local\nsample SoS. The contrast of the signatures is augmented by a method of angular\ncompounding, which provides ``focus\" control of the image sharpness, which, in\nturn, enables a visual localization of aberrating inclusions within the sample\non the fly. The localization can be performed in 2D when operated with standard\nB-mode imaging, or in 3D when operated with C-mode imaging.

Network performance drops significantly with (target) images obtained\ndifferently than its (source) training data. Due to a lack of target label\ndata, most work has focused on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Current\nUDA methods need both source and target data to train models which perform\nimage translation (harmonization) or learn domain-invariant features. However,\ntraining a model for each target domain is time consuming and computationally\nexpensive, even infeasible when target domain data are scarce or source data\nare unavailable due to data privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel self\ndomain adapted network (SDA-Net) that can rapidly adapt itself to a single test\nsubject at the testing stage, without using extra data or training a UDA model.\nThe SDA-Net consists of three parts: adaptors, task model, and auto-encoders.\nThe latter two are pre-trained offline on labeled source images. The task model\nperforms tasks like synthesis, segmentation, or classification, which may\nsuffer from the domain shift problem. At the testing stage, the adaptors are\ntrained to transform the input test image and features to reduce the domain\nshift as measured by the auto-encoders, and thus perform domain adaptation. We\nvalidated our method on retinal layer segmentation from different OCT scanners\nand T1 to T2 synthesis with T1 from different MRI scanners and with different\nimaging parameters. Results show that our SDA-Net, with a single test subject\nand a short amount of time for self adaptation at the testing stage, can\nachieve significant improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 01:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

It consists of a\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar, where only a small number of\nantennas are active in each channel use. The probing waveforms are orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM) type. The OFDM carriers are divided into\ntwo groups, one that is used by the active antennas in a shared fashion, and\nanother one, where each subcarrier is assigned to an active antenna in an\nexclusive fashion (private subcarriers). Target estimation is carried out based\non the received and transmitted symbols.

The\nprivate subcarriers are used to synthesize a virtual array for high angular\nresolution, and also for improved estimation on the active antenna indices.

Sparse Matrix-Matrix multiplication (SpMM) is a fundamental\noperator in GNNs, which performs a multiplication between a sparse matrix and a\ndense matrix. Accelerating SpMM on parallel hardware like GPUs can face the\nfollowing challenges: From the GNN application perspective, the compatibility\nneeds to be considered. General GNN algorithms require SpMM-like operations\n(e.g., pooling) between matrices, which are not supported in current\nhigh-performance GPU libraries (e.g., Nvidia cuSPARSE). Moreover, the\nsophisticated preprocessing in previous implementations will lead to heavy data\nformat conversion overheads in GNN frameworks. From the GPU hardware\nperspective, optimizations in SpMV (Sparse Matrix-Vector) designs on GPUs do\nnot apply well to SpMM. SpMM exposes the column-wise parallelism in the dense\noutput matrix, but straightforward generalization from SpMV leads to\ninefficient, uncoalesced access to sparse matrix in global memory. The sparse\nrow data can be reused among GPU threads, which is neither possible in SpMM\ndesigns inherited from SpMV.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose GE-SpMM.

In contrast to\nthe simple logical vector in single-label learning (SLL) and multi-label\nlearning (MLL), LDL assigns labels with a description degree to each instance.\nIn practice, two challenges exist in LDL, namely, how to address the\ndimensional gap problem during the learning process of LDL and how to exactly\nrecover label distributions from existing logical labels, i.e., Label\nEnhancement (LE). For most existing LDL and LE algorithms, the fact that the\ndimension of the input matrix is much higher than that of the output one is\nalway ignored and it typically leads to the dimensional reduction owing to the\nunidirectional projection.

Here, we\npropose a novel deep reinforcement learning model for collective neural crest\ncell migration. We apply the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm in\nassociation with a particle dynamics simulation environment to train agents to\ndetermine the migration path. Because of the different migration mechanisms of\nleader and follower neural crest cells, we train two types of agents (leaders\nand followers) to learn the collective cell migration behavior. For a leader\nagent, we consider a linear combination of a global task, resulting in the\nshortest path to the target source, and a local task, resulting in a\ncoordinated motion along the local chemoattractant gradient. For a follower\nagent, we consider only the local task. First, we show that the self-driven\nforces learned by the leader cell point approximately to the placode, which\nmeans that the agent is able to learn to follow the shortest path to the\ntarget. To validate our method, we compare the total time elapsed for agents to\nreach the placode computed using the proposed method and the time computed\nusing an agent-based model. The distributions of the migration time intervals\ncalculated using the two methods are shown to not differ significantly. We then\nstudy the effect of co-attraction and contact-inhibition of locomotion to the\ncollective leader cell migration. We show that the overall leader cell\nmigration for the case with co-attraction is slower because the co-attraction\nmitigates the source-driven effect. In addition, we find that the leader and\nfollower agents learn to follow a similar migration behavior as in experimental\nobservations.

Existing methods seek to improve the\nsecrecy rate by injecting artificial noise into the channel. Unfortunately,\nnoise injection cannot alter the underlying channel state, which depends on the\nmultipath environment between the transmitter and receiver.

We analyze the gap between\nthe provider's expected time-average payoffs under our policy and a clairvoyant\npolicy, which makes decisions based on complete information of the demand. We\nprove that after running our policy for D days, the loss in the expected\ntime-average payoff can be at most O((ln D)^0.5 D^(-0.25)), which decays to\nzero as D approaches infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 05:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

To reduce the annotation\ncost, one attractive solution is to leverage a large number of unlabeled images\nto build a crowd counting model in semi-supervised fashion. This paper tackles\nthe semi-supervised crowd counting problem from the perspective of feature\nlearning. Our key idea is to leverage the unlabeled images to train a generic\nfeature extractor rather than the entire network of a crowd counter. The\nrationale of this design is that learning the feature extractor can be more\nreliable and robust towards the inevitable noisy supervision generated from the\nunlabeled data. Also, on top of a good feature extractor, it is possible to\nbuild a density map regressor with much fewer density map annotations.\nSpecifically, we proposed a novel semi-supervised crowd counting method which\nis built upon two innovative components: (1) a set of inter-related binary\nsegmentation tasks are derived from the original density map regression task as\nthe surrogate prediction target; (2) the surrogate target predictors are\nlearned from both labeled and unlabeled data by utilizing a proposed\nself-training scheme which fully exploits the underlying constraints of these\nbinary segmentation tasks. Through experiments, we show that the proposed\nmethod is superior over the existing semisupervised crowd counting method and\nother representative baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 05:30:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2020 06:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

On-device training by learning from the real-world data after\ndeployment can greatly improve accuracy. However, the high computation cost\nmakes training prohibitive for resource-constrained devices. To tackle this\nproblem, we explore the computational redundancies in training and reduce the\ncomputation cost by two complementary approaches: self-supervised early\ninstance filtering on data level and error map pruning on the algorithm level.\nThe early instance filter selects important instances from the input stream to\ntrain the network and drops trivial ones.

Previous works in\nmitigating intrinsic noise assumed the knowledge of the noise model, and\nretraining the neural networks accordingly was required. In this paper, we\npropose a noise-agnostic method to achieve robust neural network performance\nagainst any noise setting.

Recent evidence has shown exocytosis to be partial or 'subquantal' at\nsingle-cell model systems, but there is a need to understand this at\ncommunicating nerve cells. Partial release allows nerve cells to control the\nsignal at the site of release during individual events, where the smaller the\nfraction released, the greater the range of regulation. Here we show that the\nfraction of the vesicular octopamine content released from a living Drosophila\nlarval neuromuscular neuron is very small. The percentage of released molecules\nwas found to be only 4.5% for simple events and 10.7% for complex (i.e.,\noscillating or flickering) events. This large content, combined with partial\nrelease controlled by fluctuations of the fusion pore, offers presynaptic\nplasticity that can be widely regulated. Two works published in 2010 suggested\nthat the Katz principle, [1] was incorrect for all-or-none release and that\nonly part of the chemical load of vesicles was released during exocytosis, at\nleast as measured as a full spike during amperometry. [2] The combination of\nelectrochemical methods to measure both release and vesicle content in 2015\nadded a wealth of information to support the concept of partial release in\nexocytosis. [3] Additionally, this has recently been supported by work with\nTIRF microscopy showing 'subquantal' release from vesicles in adrenal\nchromaffin cells and using super-resolution STED microscopy. [4] It appears\nthat the full event generally involves release of only part of the load of\nchemical messenger in single-cell model systems like adrenal chromaffin and\nPC12 cells.

Inspired by the neurobiology research about\nthe independence of remembering and forgetting, we propose to re-parameterize a\nCNN into the remembering parts and forgetting parts, where the former learn to\nmaintain the performance and the latter learn to prune. Via training with\nregular SGD on the former but a novel update rule with penalty gradients on the\nlatter, we realize structured sparsity.

In this sense, ResRep can be viewed as a successful application of\nStructural Re-parameterization.

Each DAM module performs an\nadaptive combination of the response-level semantics captured from the encoder\nand the word-level semantics specifically selected for generating each word.\nTherefore, the responses contain more detailed and non-repetitive descriptions\nwhile maintaining the semantic accuracy. Furthermore, DAM is flexible to\ncooperate with existing visual dialogue encoders and adaptive to the encoder\nstructures by constraining the information selection mode in DAM. We apply DAM\nto three typical encoders and verify the performance on the VisDial v1.0\ndataset. Experimental results show that the proposed models achieve new\nstate-of-the-art performance with high-quality responses.

In this work, we focus on\npropagation-based fake news detection, as recent studies have demonstrated that\nfake news and real news spread differently online. Specifically, considering\nthe capability of graph neural networks (GNNs) in dealing with non-Euclidean\ndata, we use GNNs to differentiate between the propagation patterns of fake and\nreal news on social media. In particular, we concentrate on two questions: (1)\nWithout relying on any text information, e.g., tweet content, replies and user\ndescriptions, how accurately can GNNs identify fake news? Machine learning\nmodels are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and avoiding the\ndependence on text-based features can make the model less susceptible to the\nmanipulation of advanced fake news fabricators. (2) How to deal with new,\nunseen data? In other words, how does a GNN trained on a given dataset perform\non a new and potentially vastly different dataset? If it achieves\nunsatisfactory performance, how do we solve the problem without re-training the\nmodel on the entire data from scratch? We study the above questions on two\ndatasets with thousands of labelled news items, and our results show that: (1)\nGNNs can achieve comparable or superior performance without any text\ninformation to state-of-the-art methods. (2) GNNs trained on a given dataset\nmay perform poorly on new, unseen data, and direct incremental training cannot\nsolve the problem---this issue has not been addressed in the previous work that\napplies GNNs for fake news detection.

We\npresent MUSE@VLT data of the most prominent outer shell of NGC 474, to\nconstrain its formation history. The stellar shell spectrum is clearly\ndetected, with a signal-to-noise ratio of around 65 pix$^{-1}$. We use a full\nspectral fitting method to determine the line-of-sight velocity and the age and\nmetallicity of the shell and associated point-like sources within the MUSE\nfield of view. We detect six GC candidates and eight PN candidates which are\nall kinematically associated to the stellar shell.

To date, this is the most\nobservationally favourable system of potentially habitable planets. Since the\nannouncement of the discovery of TRAPPIST-1 planets in 2016, a growing number\nof techniques and approaches have been used and proposed to reveal its true\nnature. Here we have compiled a state-of-the-art overview of all the\nobservational and theoretical constraints that have been obtained so far using\nthese techniques and approaches. The goal is to get a better understanding of\nwhether or not TRAPPIST-1 planets can have atmospheres, and if so, what they\nare made of. For this, we surveyed the literature on TRAPPIST-1 about topics as\nbroad as irradiation environment, orbital architecture, transit observations,\ndensity measurements, stellar contamination, and numerical climate and escape\nmodels. Each of these topics adds a brick to our understanding of the likely\natmospheres of the seven planets. We show that (i) HST transit observations,\n(ii) density measurements, (iii) atmospheric escape modelling, and (iv) gas\naccretion modelling altogether offer solid evidence against the presence of\nH2-dominated atmospheres around TRAPPIST-1 planets. This means they likely have\neither (i) a high molecular weight atmosphere or (ii) no atmosphere at all.\nThere are several key challenges ahead to characterize the bulk compositions of\nthe atmospheres (if present) of TRAPPIST-1 planets. The main one so far is\ncharacterizing and correcting for the effects of stellar contamination.\nFortunately, a new wave of observations with the James Webb Space Telescope and\nnear-infrared high-resolution ground-based spectrographs on very large\ntelescopes will bring significant advances in the coming decade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 10:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

This\nbackground represents an irreducible emission of GWs from any scaling network\nof cosmic defects, with its amplitude characterized only by the symmetry\nbreaking scale and the nature of the defects. Using classical lattice\nsimulations we calculate the GW signal emitted by defects created after the\nbreaking of a global symmetry $O(N) \\rightarrow O(N-1)$.

Hidden layers in traditional NNs receive\ninputs in the previous layer, apply activation function, and then transfer the\noutcomes to the next layer. In the proposed SpinalNet, each layer is split into\nthree splits: 1) input split, 2) intermediate split, and 3) output split. Input\nsplit of each layer receives a part of the inputs.

Consequently, the object would be considered a\nhypervelocity star, which would prove particularly interesting because its\nGalactic trajectory points in our direction. However, based on the\nspectroscopic analysis of follow-up observations, we show that the object is\nactually a short-period ($P \\approx 3.4$ h) single-lined spectroscopic binary\nsystem with a visible B-type star (effective temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eff}} =\n15\\,840\\pm160$ K and surface gravity $\\log(g) = 4.86\\pm0.04$) that is less\nluminous than typical BHB stars. Accordingly, the distance of the system is\nlower than originally thought, which renders its Galactic orbit bound to the\nGalaxy.

The abundances of He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Ca are subsolar by\nfactors from 3 to more than 100, while Fe is enriched by a factor of about 6.\nThis peculiar chemical composition pattern is most likely caused by atomic\ndiffusion processes.

This is because the effective temperature\nin these stars is not high enough to allow helium ionization, not allowing any\nconclusions on its abundance when spectroscopic techniques are employed. To\nthis end, stellar modellers resort to estimating the initial helium abundance\nvia a semi-empirical helium-to-heavy element ratio, anchored to the the\nstandard Big Bang nucleosynthesis value. Depending on the choice of solar\ncomposition used in stellar model computations, the helium-to-heavy element\nratio, ($\\Delta Y/\\Delta Z$) is found to vary between 1 and 3. In this study,\nwe use the Kepler \"LEGACY\" stellar sample, for which precise seismic data is\navailable, and explore the systematic uncertainties on the inferred stellar\nparameters (radius, mass, and age) arising from adopting different values of\n$\\Delta Y/\\Delta Z$, specifically, 1.4 and 2.0. The stellar grid constructed\nwith a higher $\\Delta Y / \\Delta Z$ value yields lower radius and mass\nestimates. We found systematic uncertainties of 1.1 per cent, 2.6 per cent, and\n13.1 per cent on radius, mass, and ages, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 11:54:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

In the future,\nrobots are expected to increasingly perform more complex tasks and, therefore,\nbe able to acquire experience from different sources as quickly as possible. A\nplausible approach to address this issue is interactive feedback, where a\ntrainer advises a learner on which actions should be taken from specific states\nto speed up the learning process. Moreover, deep reinforcement learning has\nbeen recently widely utilized in robotics to learn the environment and acquire\nnew skills autonomously. However, an open issue when using deep reinforcement\nlearning is the excessive time needed to learn a task from raw input images. In\nthis work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach with interactive\nfeedback to learn a domestic task in a human-robot scenario. We compare three\ndifferent learning methods using a simulated robotic arm for the task of\norganizing different objects; the proposed methods are (i) deep reinforcement\nlearning (DeepRL); (ii) interactive deep reinforcement learning using a\npreviously trained artificial agent as an advisor (agent-IDeepRL); and (iii)\ninteractive deep reinforcement learning using a human advisor (human-IDeepRL).\nWe demonstrate that interactive approaches provide advantages for the learning\nprocess. The obtained results show that a learner agent, using either\nagent-IDeepRL or human-IDeepRL, completes the given task earlier and has fewer\nmistakes compared to the autonomous DeepRL approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 11:55:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 11:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

We find that none of X-point, flow stagnation point, and local\ncurrent density peak coincide.

CoSOD is an emerging and rapidly growing\nextension of salient object detection (SOD), which aims to detect the\nco-occurring salient objects in a group of images. However, existing CoSOD\ndatasets often have a serious data bias, assuming that each group of images\ncontains salient objects of similar visual appearances. This bias can lead to\nthe ideal settings and effectiveness of models trained on existing datasets,\nbeing impaired in real-life situations, where similarities are usually semantic\nor conceptual. To tackle this issue, we first introduce a new benchmark, called\nCoSOD3k in the wild, which requires a large amount of semantic context, making\nit more challenging than existing CoSOD datasets. Our CoSOD3k consists of 3,316\nhigh-quality, elaborately selected images divided into 160 groups with\nhierarchical annotations. The images span a wide range of categories, shapes,\nobject sizes, and backgrounds. Second, we integrate the existing SOD techniques\nto build a unified, trainable CoSOD framework, which is long overdue in this\nfield. Specifically, we propose a novel CoEG-Net that augments our prior model\nEGNet with a co-attention projection strategy to enable fast common information\nlearning. CoEG-Net fully leverages previous large-scale SOD datasets and\nsignificantly improves the model scalability and stability. Third, we\ncomprehensively summarize 40 cutting-edge algorithms, benchmarking 18 of them\nover three challenging CoSOD datasets (iCoSeg, CoSal2015, and our CoSOD3k), and\nreporting more detailed (i.e., group-level) performance analysis. Finally, we\ndiscuss the challenges and future works of CoSOD. We hope that our study will\ngive a strong boost to growth in the CoSOD community.

The main reason is that the the nonlinear\nnetwork layer inside GCN structure is not suitable for extracting non-sematic\nfeatures(such as one-hot ID feature) in the collaborative filtering scenarios.\nIn this work, we develop a new GCN-based Collaborative Filtering model, named\nRefined Graph convolution Collaborative Filtering(RGCF), where the construction\nof the embeddings of users (items) are delicately redesigned from several\naspects during the aggregation on the graph.

We discuss\nthese results relative to foundational work by Dicke on long range scalar\ninteractions and the Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor theory, including how\ninteraction with the scalar implies a variable rest mass, and the energetics of\nthe joint scalar-gravitational interaction. We discuss the problems of tuning\nthe only available free parameter, the invariant 5D length element of the\nsources, to neutralize the scalar force and avoid the otherwise-large scalar\nforce predictions. We conclude that large classical forces are a testable\nprediction of 5D general relativity sufficient to falsify the 5D hypothesis.\nYet the emergence of a new physical interaction lengthscale is suggestive of\nfurther unexplored physics of the long range scalar field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 12:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

At this point, the Earth should have been a global\nsnowball if it possessed atmospheric properties similar to those of the modern\nEarth. An extreme atmospheric greenhouse effect, an initially more massive Sun,\nrelease of heat acquired during the accretion process of protoplanetary\nmaterial, and radioactivity of the early Earth material have been proposed as\nreservoirs or traps for heat. For now, the faint-young-sun paradox persists as\nan important problem in our understanding of the origin of life on Earth.

We show that the Earth-Moon system has lost about\n$3~ \\times ~10^{31}$ J (99% of its initial mechanical energy budget) as tidal\nheat. Tidal heating of roughly 10 W/m$^{-2}$ through the surface on a time\nscale of 100 million years could have accounted for a temperature increase of\nup to 5 degrees Celsius on the early Earth. This heating effect alone does not\nsolve the faint-young-sun paradox but it could have played a key role in\ncombination with other effects.

We concentrate on fcc-stacked\n(111)-oriented metallic $Z$/Co/Pt ($Z=4d$ series: Y$-$Pd, the noble metals: Cu,\nAg, Au, post noble metals: Zn and Cd) magnetic multilayers of films of\nmonatomic thickness. We present quantitative trends of magnetic properties:\nMagnetic moments, interlayer exchange coupling, spin-stiffness,\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, magnetic anisotropy, and the critical\ntemperature. We show that some of the $Z$ elements (Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Tc, Ru, Rh,\nand Cd) can induce antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling between the magnetic\nCo layers, and that they influence the easy magnetization axis. Employing a\nmultiscale approach, we transfer the micromagnetic parameters determined from\n$ab$ $initio$ to a micromagnetic energy functional and search for\none-dimensional spin-spiral solutions and two-dimensional skyrmions. We\ndetermine the skyrmion radius by numerically solving the equation of the\nskyrmion profile. We found an analytical expression for the skyrmion radius\nthat covers our numerical results and is valid for a large regime of\nmicromagnetic parameters. Based on this expression we have proposed a model\nthat allows to extrapolate from the $ab$ $initio$ results of monatomic films to\nmultilayers with Co films consisting of several atomic layers containing\n$10\\,$nm skyrmions. We found thickness regimes where tiny changes of the film\nthickness may alter the skyrmion radius by orders of magnitude. We estimated\nthe skyrmion size as function of temperature and found that the size can easily\ndouble going from cryogenic to room temperature. We suggest promising material\nsystems for ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically coupled spin-spiral and\nskyrmion systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 14:20:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 15:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

We demonstrate the efficiency of PT in\nreliable and precise location of the phase boundaries between different phases\nseparated by either very large (strong first-order transition) or barely\ndetectable energy barriers, where the standard Monte Carlo approach may easily\nfail to find a stable solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 14:40:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 08:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

Here we focus on tetrad gravity and its corner symplectic\npotential. We start by performing a detailed decomposition of the various\ngeometrical quantities appearing in BF theory and tetrad gravity. This provides\na new decomposition of the symplectic potential of BF theory and the simplicity\nconstraints. We then show that the dynamical variables of the tetrad gravity\ncorner phase space are the internal normal to the spacetime foliation, which is\nconjugated to the boost generator, and the corner coframe field. This allows us\nto derive several key results. First, we construct the corner Lorentz charges.\nIn addition to sphere diffeomorphisms, common to all formulations of gravity,\nthese charges add a local $\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{C})$ component to the corner\nsymmetry algebra of tetrad gravity. Second, we also reveal that the corner\nmetric satisfies a local $\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ algebra, whose Casimir\ncorresponds to the corner area element. Due to the space-like nature of the\ncorner metric, this Casimir belongs to the unitary discrete series, and its\nspectrum is therefore quantized. This result, which reconciles discreteness of\nthe area spectrum with Lorentz invariance, is proven in the continuum and\nwithout resorting to a bulk connection. Third, we show that the corner phase\nspace explains why the simplicity constraints become non-commutative on the\ncorner. This fact requires a reconciliation between the bulk and corner\nsymplectic structures, already in the classical continuum theory. Understanding\nthis leads inevitably to the introduction of edge modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 15:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

However, individuals are\nnot used to tracking the required 6-feet (2-meters) distance between themselves\nand their surroundings. An active surveillance system capable of detecting\ndistances between individuals and warning them can slow down the spread of the\ndeadly disease. Furthermore, measuring social density in a region of interest\n(ROI) and modulating inflow can decrease social distancing violation occurrence\nchance.\n  On the other hand, recording data and labeling individuals who do not follow\nthe measures will breach individuals' rights in free-societies. Here we propose\nan Artificial Intelligence (AI) based real-time social distancing detection and\nwarning system considering four important ethical factors: (1) the system\nshould never record/cache data, (2) the warnings should not target the\nindividuals, (3) no human supervisor should be in the detection/warning loop,\nand (4) the code should be open-source and accessible to the public. Against\nthis backdrop, we propose using a monocular camera and deep learning-based\nreal-time object detectors to measure social distancing. If a violation is\ndetected, a non-intrusive audio-visual warning signal is emitted without\ntargeting the individual who breached the social distancing measure. Also, if\nthe social density is over a critical value, the system sends a control signal\nto modulate inflow into the ROI.

These models are typically estimated using\nBayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation methods, which, however,\nare computationally expensive and do not scale well to large datasets.\nVariational Bayes (VB), a method from machine learning, addresses the\nshortcomings of MCMC by casting Bayesian estimation as an optimisation problem\ninstead of a simulation problem. Considering all these advantages of VB, a VB\nmethod is derived for posterior inference in negative binomial models with\nunobserved parameter heterogeneity and spatial dependence. P\\'olya-Gamma\naugmentation is used to deal with the non-conjugacy of the negative binomial\nlikelihood and an integrated non-factorised specification of the variational\ndistribution is adopted to capture posterior dependencies.

The VB approach is around 45 to 50 times faster than MCMC on a\nregular eight-core processor in a simulation and an empirical study, while\noffering similar estimation and predictive accuracy.

The crowding cost perceived by a\ntransit rider is generally estimated by capturing the trade-off that the rider\nmakes between crowding and travel time while choosing a route. However,\nexisting studies rely on static compensatory choice models and fail to account\nfor inertia and the learning behaviour of riders. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a new dynamic latent class model (DLCM) which (i) assigns riders to\nlatent compensatory and inertia/habit classes based on different decision\nrules, (ii) enables transitions between these classes over time, and (iii)\nadopts instance-based learning theory to account for the learning behaviour of\nriders. We use the expectation-maximisation algorithm to estimate DLCM, and the\nmost probable sequence of latent classes for each rider is retrieved using the\nViterbi algorithm. The proposed DLCM can be applied in any choice context to\ncapture the dynamics of decision rules used by a decision-maker. We demonstrate\nits practical advantages in estimating the crowding valuation of an Asian\nmetro's riders. To calibrate the model, we recover the daily route preferences\nand in-vehicle crowding experiences of regular metro riders using a\ntwo-month-long smart card and vehicle location data. The results indicate that\nthe average rider follows the compensatory rule on only 25.5% of route choice\noccasions. DLCM estimates also show an increase of 47% in metro riders'\nvaluation of travel time under extremely crowded conditions relative to that\nunder uncrowded conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 10:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

Specifically, the BS is able to\nadaptively switch between NOMA and OMA for the downlink transmission to\noptimize the information freshness of the network, characterized by the Age of\nInformation (AoI) metric. If the BS chooses OMA, it can only serve one client\nwithin each time slot and should decide which client to serve; if the BS\nchooses NOMA, it can serve more than one client at the same time and needs to\ndecide the power allocated to the served clients. For the simple two-client\ncase, we formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and develop the\noptimal policy for the BS to decide whether to use NOMA or OMA for each\ndownlink transmission based on the instantaneous AoI of both clients. The\noptimal policy is shown to have a switching-type property with obvious decision\nswitching boundaries. A near-optimal policy with lower computation complexity\nis also devised. For the more general multi-client scenario, inspired by the\nproposed near-optimal policy, we formulate a nonlinear optimization problem to\ndetermine the optimal power allocated to each client by maximizing the expected\nAoI drop of the network in each time slot. We resolve the formulated problem by\napproximating it as a convex optimization problem. We also derive the upper\nbound of the gap between the approximate convex problem and the original\nnonlinear, nonconvex problem. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of\nthe adopted approximation. The performance of the adaptive NOMA/OMA scheme by\nsolving the convex optimization is shown to be close to that of max-weight\npolicy solved by exhaustive search...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 11:26:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

This leads to deviation from topological\nprotection by the chiral symmetry from the exact zero energy, weakening the\nrobustness of the topological edge state. With the aid of non-Hermitian\nphysics, the splitting frequencies of edge states can be degenerated again and\ntopological protection recovered by altering the gain or loss strength of the\nstructure.

Precise alignment and\nfocusing are achieved using a precision optical rail on the alignment module.\nThe TRT Kit transforms into three telescope configurations: Newtonian,\nCassegrain, and Gregorian. Students change telescope configurations by\nexchanging the secondary mirror. The portable design and the aluminum primary\nmirror of the TRT Kit enable students to perform experiments in various\nenvironments. The minimized baffle design utilizes commercial telescope tubes,\nallowing users to look directly into the optical system while suppressing stray\nlight down to $\\sim$10$^{-8}$ point source transmittance (PST). The TRT Kit was\ntested using a point source and field images. Point source measurement of the\nNewtonian telescope configuration resulted in an 80\\% encircled energy diameter\n(EED) of 23.8 $\\mu$m.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 11:18:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

The purpose of GEP is to enhance construction planning and\nreduce the costs of installing different types of power plants. This paper\nproposes a method based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) for GEP in the presence of\nwind power plants. Since it is desired to integrate the maximum possible wind\npower production in GEP, the constraints for incorporating different levels of\nwind energy in power generation are investigated comprehensively. This will\nallow obtaining the maximum reasonable amount of wind penetration in the\nnetwork. Besides, due to the existence of different wind regimes, the\npenetration of strong and weak wind on GEP is assessed. The results show that\nthe maximum utilization of wind power generation capacity could increase the\nexploitation of more robust wind regimes. Considering the growth of the wind\nfarm industry and the cost reduction for building wind power plants, the\nsensitivity of GEP to the variations of this cost is investigated. The results\nfurther indicate that for a 10% reduction in the initial investment cost of\nwind power plants, the proposed model estimates that the overall cost will be\nminimized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 07:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}
