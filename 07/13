Here, we\nfocus on diffuse optical tomography (DOT) in medical imaging to recover unknown\nimages of interest, such as cancerous tissue in a given medium, using a\nmathematical (forward) model. The forward model in DOT is a\ndiffusion-absorption model for the photon flux. The main bottleneck in these\nproblems is the repeated evaluation of the large-scale forward model. For DOT,\nthis corresponds to solving large linear systems for each source and frequency\nat each optimization step. Moreover, Newton-type methods, often the method of\nchoice, require additional linear solves with the adjoint to compute derivative\ninformation. Emerging technology allows for large numbers of sources and\ndetectors, making these problems prohibitively expensive. Reduced order models\n(ROM) have been used to drastically reduce the system size in each optimization\nstep, while solving the inverse problem accurately. However, for large numbers\nof sources and detectors, just the construction of the candidate basis for the\nROM projection space incurs a substantial cost, as matching the full parameter\ngradient matrix in interpolatory model reduction requires large linear solves\nfor all sources and frequencies and all detectors and frequencies for each\nparameter interpolation point. As this candidate basis numerically has low\nrank, this construction is followed by a rank-revealing factorization that\ntypically reduces the number of vectors in the candidate basis substantially.\nWe propose to use randomization to approximate this basis with a drastically\nreduced number of large linear solves. We also provide a detailed analysis for\nthe low-rank structure of the candidate basis for our problem of interest.

We aim to understand how much and in which regions\ndust grains concentrate during the early phases of the protostellar collapse,\nand see how it depends on the properties of the initial cloud and of the solid\nparticles. We use the multiple species dust dynamics solver of the grid-based\ncode RAMSES to perform various simulations of dusty collapses.

We obtain a\nsignificant decoupling between the gas and the dust for grains of typical sizes\na few 10 microns. This decoupling strongly depends on the\nthermal-to-gravitational energy ratio, the grain sizes or the inclusion of a\nmagnetic field. With a semi-analytic model calibrated on our results, we show\nthat the dust ratio mostly varies exponentially with the initial Stokes number\nat a rate that depends on the local cloud properties. We find that larger\ngrains tend to settle and drift efficiently in the first-core and in the newly\nformed disk. This can produce dust-to-gas ratios of several times the initial\nvalue. Dust concentrates in high density regions and is depleted in low density\nregions. The size at which grains decouple from the gas depends on the initial\nproperties of the clouds. Since dust can not necessarily be used as a proxy for\ngas during the collapse, we emphasize on the necessity of including the\ntreatment of its dynamics in collapse simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 17:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

However, compared to quantum physics, where the reasons for the success\nof tensor network approaches over the last 30 years is well understood, very\nlittle is yet known about why these techniques work for machine learning. The\ngoal of this paper is to investigate entanglement properties of tensor network\nmodels in a current machine learning application, in order to uncover general\nprinciples that may guide future developments. We revisit the use of tensor\nnetworks for supervised image classification using the MNIST data set of\nhandwritten digits, as pioneered by Stoudenmire and Schwab [Adv. in Neur.\nInform. Proc. Sys. 29, 4799 (2016)]. Firstly we hypothesize about which state\nthe tensor network might be learning during training. For that purpose, we\npropose a plausible candidate state $|\\Sigma_{\\ell}\\rangle$ (built as a\nsuperposition of product states corresponding to images in the training set)\nand investigate its entanglement properties. We conclude that\n$|\\Sigma_{\\ell}\\rangle$ is so robustly entangled that it cannot be approximated\nby the tensor network used in that work, which must therefore be representing a\nvery different state. Secondly, we use tensor networks with a block product\nstructure, in which entanglement is restricted within small blocks of $n \\times\nn$ pixels/qubits. We find that these states are extremely expressive (e.g.\ntraining accuracy of $99.97 \\%$ already for $n=2$), suggesting that long-range\nentanglement may not be essential for image classification. However, in our\ncurrent implementation, optimization leads to over-fitting, resulting in test\naccuracies that are not competitive with other current approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 20:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

We\nconsider two hypotheses: I) explosion energy is powered by neutrinos and\n$\\alpha$ recombination, II) explosion energy is powered by neutrinos alone.\nUnder these assumptions, we derive the fundamental dimensionless parameters and\nanalytic scalings.

IUA\nshows that neural networks not only can approximate any continuous function $f$\n(universal approximation) as we have known for decades, but we can find a\nneural network, using any well-behaved activation function, whose interval\nbounds are an arbitrarily close approximation of the set semantics of $f$ (the\nresult of applying $f$ to a set of inputs). We call this notion of\napproximation interval approximation. Our theorem generalizes the recent result\nof Baader et al. (2020) from ReLUs to a rich class of activation functions that\nwe call squashable functions. Additionally, the IUA theorem implies that we can\nalways construct provably robust neural networks under $\\ell_\\infty$-norm using\nalmost any practical activation function.\n  Second, we study the computational complexity of constructing neural networks\nthat are amenable to precise interval analysis. This is a crucial question, as\nour constructive proof of IUA is exponential in the size of the approximation\ndomain. We boil this question down to the problem of approximating the range of\na neural network with squashable activation functions.

Tumor profiles can be\ncharacterized by tens of thousands of gene expression features.

In many cases tumor data does not include tumor\nsubtype labeling thus unsupervised learning methods are necessary for tumor\nsubtype discovery. This work aims to learn meaningful and low dimensional\nrepresentations of tumor samples and find tumor subtype clusters while keeping\nbiological signatures without using tumor labels. The proposed method named\nLatent Kernel Feature Selection (LKFS) is an unsupervised approach for gene\nselection in tumor gene expression profiles. By using Autoencoders a low\ndimensional and denoised latent space is learned as a target representation to\nguide a Multiple Kernel Learning model that selects a subset of genes.

In order to\nevaluate the performance of the proposed unsupervised feature selection method\nthe obtained features and clusters are analyzed by clinical significance. The\nproposed method has been applied on three tumor datasets which are Brain, Renal\nand Lung, each one composed by two tumor subtypes.

Most work to date has focused on the zero magnetic field phase\ndiagram, with magnetic field (B) used as a probe of the B=0 band structure.\nHere, we show that twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) in a B as low as 2T hosts a\ncascade of ferromagnetic Chern insulators with Chern number |C|=1,2 and 3. We\nargue that the emergence of the Chern insulators is driven by the interplay of\nthe moire superlattice with the B, which endow the flat bands with a\nsubstructure of topologically nontrivial subbands characteristic of the\nHofstadter butterfly. The new phases can be accounted for in a Stoner picture\nin which exchange interactions favor polarization into one or more spin- and\nvalley-isospin flavors; in contrast to conventional quantum Hall ferromagnets,\nhowever, electrons polarize into between one and four copies of a single\nHofstadter subband with Chern number C=-1. In the case of the C=\\pm3 insulators\nin particular, B catalyzes a first order phase transition from the spin- and\nvalley-unpolarized B=0 state into the ferromagnetic state. Distinct from other\nmoire heterostructures, tBLG realizes the strong-lattice limit of the\nHofstadter problem and hosts Coulomb interactions that are comparable to the\nfull bandwidth W and are consequently much stronger than the width of the\nindividual Hofstadter subbands. In our experimental data, the dominance of\nCoulomb interactions manifests through the appearance of Chern insulating\nstates with spontaneously broken superlattice symmetry at half filling of a\nC=-2 subband. Our experiments show that that tBLG may be an ideal venue to\nexplore the strong interaction limit within partially filled Hofstadter bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 22:27:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 22:03:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 06:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-21"}

In this paper, a framework\ncalled ARkNLS (Alternating Rank-k Nonnegativity constrained Least Squares) is\nproposed for computing NMF. First, a recursive formula for the solution of the\nrank-k nonnegativity-constrained least squares (NLS) is established. This\nrecursive formula can be used to derive the closed-form solution for the Rank-k\nNLS problem for any integer k $\\ge$ 1. As a result, each subproblem for an\nalternating rank-k nonnegative least squares framework can be obtained based on\nthis closed form solution. Assuming that all matrices involved in rank-k NLS in\nthe context of NMF computation are of full rank, two of the currently best NMF\nalgorithms HALS (hierarchical alternating least squares) and ANLS-BPP\n(Alternating NLS based on Block Principal Pivoting) can be considered as\nspecial cases of ARkNLS with k = 1 and k = r for rank r NMF, respectively. This\npaper is then focused on the framework with k = 3, which leads to a new\nalgorithm for NMF via the closed-form solution of the rank-3 NLS problem.\nFurthermore, a new strategy that efficiently overcomes the potential\nsingularity problem in rank-3 NLS within the context of NMF computation is also\npresented.

Because of its computational costs, there is a growing\ninterest in accelerating SGD on HPC resources like GPU clusters. However, the\nperformance of parallel SGD is still bottlenecked by the high communication\ncosts even with a fast connection among the machines. A simple approach to\nalleviating this problem, used in many existing efforts, is to perform\ncommunication every few iterations, using a constant averaging period. In this\npaper, we show that the optimal averaging period in terms of convergence and\ncommunication cost is not a constant, but instead varies over the course of the\nexecution. Specifically, we observe that reducing the variance of model\nparameters among the computing nodes is critical to the convergence of periodic\nparameter averaging SGD. Given a fixed communication budget, we show that it is\nmore beneficial to synchronize more frequently in early iterations to reduce\nthe initial large variance and synchronize less frequently in the later phase\nof the training process. We propose a practical algorithm, named ADaptive\nPeriodic parameter averaging SGD (ADPSGD), to achieve a smaller overall\nvariance of model parameters, and thus better convergence compared with the\nConstant Periodic parameter averaging SGD (CPSGD). We evaluate our method with\nseveral image classification benchmarks and show that our ADPSGD indeed\nachieves smaller training losses and higher test accuracies with smaller\ncommunication compared with CPSGD. Compared with gradient-quantization SGD, we\nshow that our algorithm achieves faster convergence with only half of the\ncommunication.

Knowledge\nDistillation (KD) has been widely used for semi-supervised image\nclassification. However, adapting these methods for SSOD has the following\nobstacles. (1) The teacher model serves a dual role as a teacher and a student,\nsuch that the teacher predictions on unlabeled images may be very close to\nthose of student, which limits the upper-bound of the student. (2) The class\nimbalance issue in SSOD hinders an efficient knowledge transfer from teacher to\nstudent. To address these problems, we propose a novel method Temporal\nSelf-Ensembling Teacher (TSE-T) for SSOD. Differently from previous KD based\nmethods, we devise a temporally evolved teacher model. First, our teacher model\nensembles its temporal predictions for unlabeled images under stochastic\nperturbations. Second, our teacher model ensembles its temporal model weights\nwith the student model weights by an exponential moving average (EMA) which\nallows the teacher gradually learn from the student. These self-ensembling\nstrategies increase data and model diversity, thus improving teacher\npredictions on unlabeled images. Finally, we use focal loss to formulate\nconsistency regularization term to handle the data imbalance problem, which is\na more efficient manner to utilize the useful information from unlabeled images\nthan a simple hard-thresholding method which solely preserves confident\npredictions.

The U2S framework is composed\nof three subnetworks: a universal network, a category-specific network, and a\nmask network. The universal network first learns universal feature\nrepresentations. The mask network then generates attention masks for confusing\nclasses through category regularization based on the output of the universal\nnetwork. The mask is further used to guide the category-specific network for\nclass-specific feature representations. The entire framework is optimized in an\nend-to-end manner. Experiments on a variety of benchmark datasets, e.g., the\nSomething-Something, UCF101, and HMDB51 datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the U2S framework; i.e., U2S can focus on discriminative spatiotemporal\nregions for confusing categories.

Simple charge neutral radical\nfunctionalizations typically detach from the basal planes upon reduction. For\nexample, epoxy oxygens irreversibly detach from graphene when reduced by an\nalkali metal. The radical anion functionalization of 2D materials results in a\nstable reduced state that can reversibly be oxidized and has high ionic\nconductivity due to the great mobility of the cations between the negatively\ncharged functional groups on the surface. Depending on the oxidation state of\nthese systems, a high concentration of hole states can also be realized\nallowing for good electronic conductivity. These properties can further allow\nfor improved energy storage devices via transition metal free cathode active\nspecies, solid electrolytes, electroconductive additives, separators, coatings\nfor metal anodes and heat conductors through a single material. One possible\nrealization of the above principles is the 2D salt An(BN)2OBX3, where A is an\nalkali atom (Li, Na, etc; 0=<n=<2) or alkaline earth (Mg, etc; 0=<n=<1) and X\nis a halide (typically F or Cl).

In this paper, we present AI Playground (AIP), an\nopen-source, Unreal Engine-based tool for generating and labeling virtual image\ndata. With AIP, it is trivial to capture the same image under different\nconditions (e.g., fidelity, lighting, etc.) and with different ground truths\n(e.g., depth or surface normal values).

We confirmed the findings of other\nstudies that segmentation models are very sensitive to fidelity, but we also\nfound that they are just as sensitive to lighting. In contrast, depth and\nnormal estimation models seem to be less sensitive to fidelity or lighting and\nmore sensitive to the structure of the image.

Therefore, it is crucial to be able to promptly\nand maybe frequently develop high-quality replanned observation schemes that\nminimize the effects on the scheduled tasks. A bottom-up distributed\ncoordinated framework together with an improved contract net are proposed to\nfacilitate the dynamic task replanning for heterogeneous Earth observation\nresources.

Additionally, the ice shell\nthat encompasses the ocean has dramatic meridional thickness variations that,\nin steady state, must be sustained against processes acting to remove these ice\nthickness anomalies. One mechanism that would maintain variations in the ice\nshell thickness involves spatially-separated regions of freezing and melting at\nthe ocean-ice interface.

In addition, due to just a 1 nm ferroelectric barrier,\nthese junctions provide large tunnel current (> 1 A/cm$^2$) at low read\nvoltage, orders of magnitude larger than reported thicker HfO$_2$-based FTJs.\nTherefore, our proof-of-principle demonstration provides an approach to\nsimultaneously overcome three major drawbacks of prototypical FTJs: a\nSi-compatible ultrathin ferroelectric, large electroresistance, and large read\ncurrent for high-speed operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 04:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

We show that it is possible to increase the\ndepth of a network indefinitely, so long as the width increases as well.\nFurthermore, our bounds are asymptotically tight under reasonable assumptions:\nfirst, the upper bound coincides with the true probability for a single-layer\nnetwork with the largest possible input set. Second, the true probability\nconverges to our lower bound as the input set shrinks to a single point, or as\nthe network complexity grows under an assumption about the output variance. We\nconfirm these results by numerical simulation, showing rapid convergence to the\nlower bound with increasing network depth.

With its fundamental theory\nand tractable optimal policy, LQR has been revisited and analyzed in recent\nyears, in terms of reinforcement learning scenarios such as the model-free or\nmodel-based setting. In this paper, we introduce the \\textit{Structured Policy\nIteration} (S-PI) for LQR, a method capable of deriving a structured linear\npolicy. Such a structured policy with (block) sparsity or low-rank can have\nsignificant advantages over the standard LQR policy: more interpretable,\nmemory-efficient, and well-suited for the distributed setting. In order to\nderive such a policy, we first cast a regularized LQR problem when the model is\nknown. Then, our Structured Policy Iteration (S-PI) algorithm, which takes a\npolicy evaluation step and a policy improvement step in an iterative manner,\ncan solve this regularized LQR efficiently. We further extend the S-PI\nalgorithm to the model-free setting where a smoothing procedure is adopted to\nestimate the gradient. In both the known-model and model-free setting, we prove\nconvergence analysis under the proper choice of parameters. Finally, the\nexperiments demonstrate the advantages of S-PI in terms of balancing the LQR\nperformance and level of structure by varying the weight parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 06:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

The existence of asteroid complexes produced by the disruption of these\ncomets suggests that evolved comets could also produce high-strength materials\nable to survive as meteorites.

Methods. We compared the spectral behaviour\nof 2P/Encke with laboratory spectra of carbonaceous chondrites. Different\nspecimens of the common carbonaceous chondrite groups do not match the overall\nfeatures and slope of comet 2P/Encke.

Here we investigate the\ndependence of these currents on additional Zeeman fields on the heterostructure\nand on variations of the reservoir magnetizations. In contrast to the particle\ncurrent, the spin currents are not necessarily conserved; an additional spin\npolarization is injected into the reservoirs.

This spin current can be\nenhanced by increasing the magnetization of the other reservoir, and can also\nbe tuned by the SOI and the various magnetic fields. When only one reservoir is\nmagnetized then the spin current into the other reservoir has arbitrary tunable\nsize and direction. In particular, this spin current changes as the\nmagnetization of the other reservoir is rotated.

However, their properties are largely unknown,\nand measuring magnetic fields in galaxy clusters is challenging, especially on\nlarge-scales outside of individual radio sources. In this work, we probe the\nplane-of-the-sky orientation of magnetic fields in clusters using the intensity\ngradients. The technique is a branch of the Gradient Technique (GT) that\nemploys emission intensity maps from turbulent gas. We utilize the Chandra\nX-ray images of the Perseus, M 87, Coma, and A2597 galaxy clusters, and the VLA\nradio observations of the synchrotron emission from Perseus. We find that the\nfields predominantly follow the sloshing arms in Perseus, which is in agreement\nwith numerical simulations. The GT-predicted magnetic field shows signatures of\nmagnetic draping around rising bubbles driven by supermassive black hole (SMBH)\nfeedback in the centers of cool-core clusters, as well as draping around\nsubstructures merging with the Coma cluster. We calculate the mean-field\norientation with respect to the radial direction in these clusters.

With the advent of gravitational-wave astrophysics it has\nbecome possible to test this prediction, and there is an important associated\neffort to understand what theoretical uncertainties modify the boundaries of\nthis gap. In this work we study the impact of rotation on the hydrodynamics of\nPISNe, which leave no compact remnant, as well as the evolution of\npulsational-PISNe (PPISNe), which undergo thermonuclear eruptions before\nforming a compact object. We perform simulations of non-rotating and\nrapidly-rotating stripped helium stars in a metal poor environment\n$(Z_\\odot/50)$ in order to resolve the lower edge of the upper mass-gap. We\nfind that the outcome of our simulations is dependent on the efficiency of\nangular momentum transport, with models that include efficient coupling through\nthe Spruit-Tayler dynamo shifting the lower edge of the mass-gap upwards by\n$\\sim 4\\%$, while simulations that do not include this effect shift it upwards\nby $\\sim 15\\%$. From this, we expect the lower edge of the upper mass-gap to be\ndependent on BH spin, which can be tested as the number of observed BH mergers\nincreases. Moreover, we show that stars undergoing PPISNe have extended\nenvelopes ($R\\sim 10-1000~R_\\odot$) at iron-core collapse, making them\npromising progenitors for ultra-long gamma-ray bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 07:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

In the\naccompanying paper (Marchant & Moriya 2020), we have shown that some\nrapidly-rotating hydrogen-free GRB progenitors that experience pulsational\npair-instability can keep an extended structure caused by pulsational\npair-instability until the core collapse. Such progenitors have large radii\nexceeding 10 Rsun and they sometimes reach beyond 1000 Rsun at the time of the\ncore collapse. They are, therefore, promising progenitors of ultra-long GRBs.\nWe here perform the light-curve modeling of the explosions of one extended\nhydrogen-free progenitor with a radius of 1962 Rsun.

The 56Ni decay energy input can affect\nthe light curves after the optical light-curve peak and make the light-curve\ndecay slow when the 56Ni mass is around 1 Msun.

Such\na a point of view provides a fairly general setting where to discuss the\npresence of non-local effects; it is performed in the light of the following\ngeneral consistency criteria: i) entanglement corresponds to non-local\ncorrelations and cannot be generated by local operations; ii) when, by\n\"freezing\" suitable degrees of freedom, identical particles can be effectively\ndistinguished, their entanglement must reduce to the one that holds for\ndistinguishable particles; iii) in absence of other quantum resources, only\nentanglement can outperform classical information protocols. These three\nrequests provide a setting that allows to evaluate strengths and weaknesses of\nthe existing approaches to indistinguishable particle entanglement and to\ncontribute to the current understanding of such a crucial issue. Indeed, they\ncan be classified into five different classes: four hinging on the notion of\nparticle and one based on that of physical modes. We show that only the latter\napproach is consistent with all three criteria, each of the others indeed\nviolating at least one of them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 09:07:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 10:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-24"}

The key idea is to approach the semantics of\nan interaction as we do for a formal language. This approach consists of two\nsteps: first to assign values to variables and second to provide meaning by an\ninterpretation function. A natural choice for the variables are the state\nfunctions of the interacting systems, assigning values at each time step.\nThereby the description of a system's behaviour with an input/output-transition\nsystem (I/O-TS) becomes a representation of the variable-to-value\nassignments.To identify the interpretation function I propose to model the\ninteraction of systems based on Shannon's theory of information with the\nprotocol concept, complemented by decisions to form a \"game in interactive form\n(GIF)\". Decisions in this sense determine the transition relation and thereby\ncreate a transition function. Then the natural choice for the interpretation\nfunction is the transition function of the GIF. In this sense, the\ninterpretation of the interaction becomes its execution. Now we can say that\nthe interpretation of the characters during the GIF's execution results in\ntheir meaning, the result of the mapping. Equivalent meaning is based on\nresulting equivalent states of the GIF. Based on the decisions we can partition\nany GIF into a deterministic traditional automaton where the states represent\nequivalance classes of GIF-states related to a single decision. Except for the\nutility function, this automaton is equivalent to a traditional game in\nextensive form. Thus, traditional game theory actually abstracts from\ninteractions and deals with the meaning of decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 09:22:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 12:03:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

Motion patterns can be an\neffective means to identify different activities. Global and local motions have\ntheir respective emphasis on different activities, which are difficult to\ncapture from the optical flow due to the mixture of global and local motions.\nHence it calls for a more effective way to separate the global and local\nmotions. When it comes to the specific case for basketball game analysis, the\nsuccessful score for each round can be reliably detected by the appearance\nvariation around the basket. Based on the observations, we propose a scheme to\nfuse global and local motion patterns (MPs) and key visual information (KVI)\nfor semantic event recognition in basketball videos. Firstly, an algorithm is\nproposed to estimate the global motions from the mixed motions based on the\nintrinsic property of camera adjustments.

SMEs have specific\ncharacteristics which separate them from large companies and influence their\nadoption of good cybersecurity practices. To mitigate the SMEs' cybersecurity\nadoption issues and raise their awareness of cyber threats, we have designed a\nself-paced security assessment and capability improvement method, CYSEC. CYSEC\nis a security awareness and training method that utilises self-reporting\nquestionnaires to collect companies' information about cybersecurity awareness,\npractices, and vulnerabilities to generate automated recommendations for\ncounselling. However, confidentiality concerns about cybersecurity information\nhave an impact on companies' willingness to share their information. Security\ninformation sharing decreases the risk of incidents and increases users'\nself-efficacy in security awareness programs. This paper presents the results\nof semi-structured interviews with seven chief information security officers of\nSMEs to evaluate the impact of online consent communication on motivation for\ninformation sharing. The results were analysed in respect of the Self\nDetermination Theory. The findings demonstrate that online consent with\nmultiple options for indicating a suitable level of agreement improved\nmotivation for information sharing. This allows many SMEs to participate in\nsecurity information sharing activities and supports security experts to have a\nbetter overview of common vulnerabilities.

A reliable technique for monitoring scour would help bridge engineers\ntake timely countermeasures to safeguard against failure. Although\nvibration-based techniques for monitoring structural damage have had limited\nsuccess, primarily due to insufficient sensitivity, these have tended to focus\non the detection of local damage. High natural frequency sensitivity has\nrecently been reported for scour damage. Previous experiments to investigate\nthis have been limited as a result of the cost of full-scale testing and the\nfact that scaled-down soil structure models tested outside a centrifuge do not\nadequately simulate full-scale behaviour. This paper describes the development\nof what is believed to be the first-ever centrifuge-testing programme to\nestablish the sensitivity of bridge natural frequency to scour. For the\nfundamental mode of vibration, these tests found up to a 40% variation in\nnatural frequency for 30% loss of embedment. Models of three other types of\nfoundation, which represent a shallow pad foundation, a deep pile bent and a\ndeep monopile, were also tested in the centrifuge at different scour levels.\nThe shallow foundation model showed lower frequency sensitivity to scour than\nthe deep foundation models. The level of frequency sensitivity (3.1 to 44% per\nscour depth equivalent to 30% of embedment of scour) detected in this\nexperiment demonstrates the potential for using natural frequency as an\nindicator of both local and global scour of bridges, particularly those with\ndeep foundations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 11:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

While\nbeing effective in exploiting contextual information around humans, e.g., human\nappearance and scene category, they are easily fooled by out-of-context action\nvideos where the contexts do not exactly match with target actions. In\ncontrast, pose-based methods, which take a sequence of human skeletons only as\ninput, suffer from inaccurate pose estimation or ambiguity of human pose per\nse. Integrating these two approaches has turned out to be non-trivial; training\na model with both appearance and pose ends up with a strong bias towards\nappearance and does not generalize well to unseen videos. To address this\nproblem, we propose to learn pose-driven feature integration that dynamically\ncombines appearance and pose streams by observing pose features on the fly.

Result: Plausible parameter maps were obtained with RGD\nfrom single-shell in vivo data. The plausibility of these maps was shown to be\ndetermined by the initialization. Tests with simulated lesions inserted into\nthe in vivo data revealed that the RGD approach cannot distinguish FW from\ntissue MD alterations, contrarily to the NLS algorithm. Conclusion: RGD FWE-DTI\nhas limited specificity and, thus, its results from single-shell data should be\ncarefully interpreted. When possible, multi-shell acquisitions and the NLS\napproach should be preferred instead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 13:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

This\ntask is particularly crucial in enhanced sampling simulations. There we seek a\nfew generalized degrees of freedom, referred to as collective variables (CVs),\nto represent and drive the sampling of the free energy landscape. In theory,\nthese CVs should separate different metastable states and correspond to the\nslow degrees of freedom of the studied physical process. To this aim, we\npropose a new method that we call multiscale reweighted stochastic embedding\n(MRSE). Our work builds upon a parametric version of stochastic neighbor\nembedding.

We\nintroduce several new advancements to stochastic neighbor embedding methods\nthat make MRSE especially suitable for enhanced sampling simulations: (1)\nweight-tempered random sampling as a landmark selection scheme to obtain\ntraining data sets that strike a balance between equilibrium representation and\ncapturing important metastable states lying higher in free energy; (2) a\nmultiscale representation of the high-dimensional feature space via a Gaussian\nmixture probability model; and (3) a reweighting procedure to account for\ntraining data from a biased probability distribution.

However, the performance of the FL suffers from\nthe failure of communication links and missing nodes, especially when\ncontinuous exchanges of model parameters are required. Therefore, we propose\nthe use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as wireless relays to facilitate the\ncommunications between the IoV components and the FL server and thus improving\nthe accuracy of the FL. However, a single UAV may not have sufficient resources\nto provide services for all iterations of the FL process. In this paper, we\npresent a joint auction-coalition formation framework to solve the allocation\nof UAV coalitions to groups of IoV components. Specifically, the coalition\nformation game is formulated to maximize the sum of individual profits of the\nUAVs. The joint auction-coalition formation algorithm is proposed to achieve a\nstable partition of UAV coalitions in which an auction scheme is applied to\nsolve the allocation of UAV coalitions. The auction scheme is designed to take\ninto account the preferences of IoV components over heterogeneous UAVs. The\nsimulation results show that the grand coalition, where all UAVs join a single\ncoalition, is not always stable due to the profit-maximizing behavior of the\nUAVs. In addition, we show that as the cooperation cost of the UAVs increases,\nthe UAVs prefer to support the IoV components independently and not to form any\ncoalition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 13:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

Most existing SAR image formation\nmethods result in a maximum a posteriori image which approximates the\nreflectivity of an unknown ground scene. This single image provides no\nquantification of the certainty with which the features in the estimate should\nbe trusted. In addition, finding the mode is generally not the best way to\ninterrogate a posterior. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a\nsampling framework to SAR image formation. A hierarchical Bayesian model is\nconstructed using conjugate priors that directly incorporate coherent imaging\nand the problematic speckle phenomenon which is known to degrade image quality.\nSamples of the resulting posterior as well as parameters governing speckle and\nnoise are obtained using a Gibbs sampler. These samples may then be used to\ncompute estimates, and also to derive other statistics like variance which aid\nin uncertainty quantification. The latter information is particularly important\nin SAR, where ground truth images even for synthetically-created examples are\ntypically unknown. An example result using real-world data shows that the\nsampling-based approach introduced here to SAR image formation provides\nparameter-free estimates with improved contrast and significantly reduced\nspeckle, as well as unprecedented uncertainty quantification information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 13:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

We prove the topological\norigin of the designed model by the direct evaluation of the Zak phase\nhighlighting the feasibility of our proposal for state-of-the-art fabrication\ntechnologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 14:19:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

In addition to previous work on the dynamics within\nthe bottleneck, this study focuses on the dynamics in front of the bottleneck,\nmore specifically, at entrances. The experimental setup simulates an entrance\nscenario to a concert consisting of an entrance gate (serving as bottleneck)\nand a corridor formed by barriers. The parameters examined are the corridor\nwidth, degree of motivation and priming of the social norm of queuing. The\nanalysis is based on head trajectories and questionnaires. We show that the\ndensity of persons per square metre depends on motivation and also increases\ncontinuously with increasing corridor width meaning that a density reduction\ncan be achieved by a reduction of space. In comparison to other corridor widths\nobserved, the narrowest corridor is rated as being fairer, more comfortable and\nas showing less unfair behaviour. Pushing behaviour is seen as ambivalent: it\nis rated as unfair and listed as a strategy for faster access.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 14:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

Moreover, such standard DNNs do not allow to\nleverage information from heterogeneously annotated training data, where for\nexample, labels may be provided with different levels of granularity.\nFurthermore, DNNs do not produce results with simultaneous different levels of\nconfidence for different levels of detail, they are most commonly an all or\nnothing approach. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of\nnested learning: how to obtain a hierarchical representation of the input such\nthat a coarse label can be extracted first, and sequentially refine this\nrepresentation, if the sample permits, to obtain successively refined\npredictions, all of them with the corresponding confidence.

We show that, when the receiver's action space is finite,\ntruth-leaning equilibrium may fail to exist, and it is not equivalent to\nequilibrium of the perturbed game. To restore existence, we introduce a\ndisturbed game with a small uncertainty about the receiver's payoff. A\npurifiable truthful equilibrium is the limit of a sequence of truth-leaning\nequilibria in the disturbed games as the disturbances converge to zero.

In this framework, the\nBCIs based on the P300 Event-Related Potentials (ERP), which represent the\nelectrical responses recorded from the brain after specific events or stimuli,\nhave proven to be particularly successful and robust. The presence or the\nabsence of a P300 evoked potential within the EEG features is determined\nthrough a classification algorithm. Linear classifiers such as SWLDA and SVM\nare the most used for ERPs' classification.

This is the case\nwhen one needs a risk-free (default-free) discounting, but default protection\non funding providers is not traded. For this case, we derive a default\ncompensation factor that describes the present value of a strategy to\ncompensate for default (like buying default protection would do).

Existing one-stage 3D object detection methods can achieve\nreal-time performance, however, they are dominated by anchor-based detectors\nwhich are inefficient and require additional post-processing. In this paper, we\neliminate anchors and model an object as a single point--the center point of\nits bounding box. Based on the center point, we propose an anchor-free\nCenterNet3D network that performs 3D object detection without anchors. Our\nCenterNet3D uses keypoint estimation to find center points and directly\nregresses 3D bounding boxes. However, because inherent sparsity of point\nclouds, 3D object center points are likely to be in empty space which makes it\ndifficult to estimate accurate boundaries. To solve this issue, we propose an\nextra corner attention module to enforce the CNN backbone to pay more attention\nto object boundaries. Besides, considering that one-stage detectors suffer from\nthe discordance between the predicted bounding boxes and corresponding\nclassification confidences, we develop an efficient keypoint-sensitive warping\noperation to align the confidences to the predicted bounding boxes. Our\nproposed CenterNet3D is non-maximum suppression free which makes it more\nefficient and simpler. We evaluate CenterNet3D on the widely used KITTI dataset\nand more challenging nuScenes dataset. Our method outperforms all\nstate-of-the-art anchor-based one-stage methods and has comparable performance\nto two-stage methods as well.

In this work, a simplified DUGKS is proposed\nwith reconstruction stage on a whole time step instead of half time step in\noriginal DUGKS. Using temporal/spatial integral Boltzmann Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook\n(BGK) equation, the transformed distribution function with inclusion of\ncollision effect is constructed. The macro and mesoscopic fluxes of the cell on\nnext time step is predicted by reconstruction of transformed distribution\nfunction at interfaces along particle velocity characteristic lines.

Equilibrium distribution\nfunction on next time step can also be updated. Gas distribution function is\nupdated by FV scheme through its predicted mesoscopic flux in a time step.\nCompared with the original DUGKS, the computational process of the proposed\nmethod is more concise because of the omission of half time step flux\ncalculation. Numerical time step is only limited by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy\n(CFL) condition and relatively good stability has been preserved.

Evolutionary algorithm (EA) is one of the\nmethods for solving NESs, given their global search capability and an ability\nto locate multiple roots of a NES simultaneously within one run. Currently, the\nmajority of research on using EAs to solve NESs focuses on transformation\ntechniques and improving the performance of the used EAs. By contrast, the\nproblem domain knowledge of NESs is particularly investigated in this study,\nusing which we propose to incorporate the variable reduction strategy (VRS)\ninto EAs to solve NESs. VRS makes full use of the systems of expressing a NES\nand uses some variables (i.e., core variable) to represent other variables\n(i.e., reduced variables) through the variable relationships existing in the\nequation systems. It enables to reduce partial variables and equations and\nshrink the decision space, thereby reducing the complexity of the problem and\nimproving the search efficiency of the EAs. To test the effectiveness of VRS in\ndealing with NESs, this paper integrates VRS into two existing state-of-the-art\nEA methods (i.e., MONES and DRJADE), respectively.
