The overall algorithm,\ntwo scale adaptive (TSA) scheme, is developed for both convex and non-convex\nstochastic optimization problems.

Results reveal that the flow in the closure region is highly\nunsteady and turbulent. The main cause of this is established to be the\npressure gradient occurring due to the stagnation of the flow on the beach wall\nof the cavity. The pressure gradient leads to a steep incline in the mean\nlocation of the air-water interface, which, in turn, leads to the flow\nseparating from it and forming a recirculation zone, in which air and water are\nmixed. The separated flow becomes turbulent, which further facilitates the\nmixing and entrainment of air.

We\nprovide a unified Lie algebraic framework for developing efficient measurement\nschemes for quantum observables, it is based on two elements: 1) embedding the\nobservable operator in a Lie algebra and 2) transforming Lie algebra elements\ninto those of a Cartan sub-algebra (CSA) using unitary operators.

Longitudinal positron emission\ntomography (PET) scans can be used quantify the extend of abnormal tau spread.\nSuch PET-based image biomarkers are a promising technology for AD diagnosis and\nprognosis. Here, we propose to calibrate an organ-scale biophysical\nmathematical model using longitudinal PET scans to extract characteristic\ngrowth patterns and spreading of tau.

When the number of explanatory features\nis relatively large, scientific researchers are of interest to perform\ncontrolled feature selection in order to simplify the downstream analysis. This\npaper introduces a new framework for feature selection in GLMs that can achieve\nfalse discovery rate (FDR) control in two asymptotic regimes. The key step is\nto construct a mirror statistic to measure the importance of each feature,\nwhich is based upon two (asymptotically) independent estimates of the\ncorresponding true coefficient obtained via either the data-splitting method or\nthe Gaussian mirror method. The FDR control is achieved by taking advantage of\nthe mirror statistic's property that, for any null feature, its sampling\ndistribution is (asymptotically) symmetric about 0. In the moderate-dimensional\nsetting in which the ratio between the dimension (number of features) p and the\nsample size n converges to a fixed value, we construct the mirror statistic\nbased on the maximum likelihood estimation. In the high-dimensional setting\nwhere p is much larger than n, we use the debiased Lasso to build the mirror\nstatistic. Compared to the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, which crucially relies\non the asymptotic normality of the Z statistic, the proposed methodology is\nscale free as it only hinges on the symmetric property, thus is expected to be\nmore robust in finite-sample cases. Both simulation results and a real data\napplication show that the proposed methods are capable of controlling the FDR,\nand are often more powerful than existing methods including the\nBenjamini-Hochberg procedure and the knockoff filter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 16:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

The traditional graph-based optimal surface\nsegmentation method has proven its effectiveness with its ability of capturing\nvarious surface priors in a uniform graph model. However, its efficacy heavily\nrelies on handcrafted features that are used to define the surface cost for the\n\"goodness\" of a surface. Recently, deep learning (DL) is emerging as powerful\ntools for medical image segmentation thanks to its superior feature learning\ncapability. Unfortunately, due to the scarcity of training data in medical\nimaging, it is nontrivial for DL networks to implicitly learn the global\nstructure of the target surfaces, including surface interactions. In this work,\nwe propose to parameterize the surface cost functions in the graph model and\nleverage DL to learn those parameters. The multiple optimal surfaces are then\nsimultaneously detected by minimizing the total surface cost while explicitly\nenforcing the mutual surface interaction constraints.

Unfortunately, for Kirchhoff-Love shells,\nstrong enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions is difficult because both\nfunctional and derivative boundary conditions must be applied. A popular\nalternative is to employ Nitsche's method to weakly enforce all boundary\nconditions. However, while many Nitsche-based formulations have been proposed\nin the literature, they lack comprehensive error analyses and verifications. In\nfact, existing formulations are variationally inconsistent and yield\nsub-optimal convergence rates when used with common boundary condition\nspecifications. In this paper, we present a novel Nitsche-based formulation for\nthe linear Kirchhoff-Love shell that is provably stable and optimally\nconvergent for general sets of admissible boundary conditions. To arrive at our\nformulation, we first present a framework for constructing Nitsche's method for\nany abstract variational constrained minimization problem. We then apply this\nframework to the linear Kirchhoff-Love shell and, for the particular case of\nNURBS-based isogeometric analysis, we prove that the resulting formulation\nyields optimal convergence rates in both the shell energy norm and the standard\n$L^2$-norm. In the process, we derive the Euler-Lagrange equations for general\nsets of admissible boundary conditions and show that the Euler-Lagrange\nboundary conditions typically presented in the literature is incorrect. We\nverify our formulation by manufacturing solutions for a new shell obstacle\ncourse that encompasses flat, parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptic geometric\nconfigurations. These manufactured solutions allow us to robustly measure the\nerror across the entire shell in contrast with current best practices where\ndisplacement and stress errors are only measured at specific locations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 17:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

It is used to model the accretion scenarios for a range of\nphysical conditions of protoplanetary discs.

We find that the accretion of metal-poor (gas) or\nmetal-rich (dust) material has a significant impact on the chemical composition\nof the stellar convective envelope. As a consequence, the evolutionary track of\nthe star diverts from the standard scenario predicted by canonical stellar\nevolution models, which assume a constant and homogeneous chemical composition\nafter the assembly of the star has finished.

Among these diffuse radio structures, radio mini-halos are found in\nthe central regions of cool core clusters. Their origin is still unknown and\nthey are challenging to discover; less than thirty have been published to date.\nBased on new VLA observations, we confirmed the mini-halo in the massive strong\ncool core cluster PKS 0745$-$191 ($z=0.1028$) and discovered one in the massive\ncool core cluster MACS J1447.4+0827 ($z=0.3755$). Furthermore, using a detailed\nanalysis of all known mini-halos, we explore the relation between mini-halos\nand AGN feedback processes from the central galaxy. We find evidence of strong,\npreviously unknown correlations between mini-halo radio power and X-ray cavity\npower, and between mini-halo and the central galaxy radio power related to the\nrelativistic jets when spectrally decomposing the AGN radio emission into a\ncomponent for past outbursts and one for on-going accretion. Overall, our study\nindicates that mini-halos are directly connected to the central AGN in\nclusters, following previous suppositions. We hypothesize that AGN feedback may\nbe one of the dominant mechanisms giving rise to mini-halos by injecting energy\ninto the intra-cluster medium and reaccelerating an old population of\nparticles, while sloshing motion may drive the overall shape of mini-halos\ninside cold fronts. AGN feedback may therefore not only play a vital role in\noffsetting cooling in cool core clusters, but may also play a fundamental role\nin re-energizing non-thermal particles in clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 15:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

Results from more accurate but\ncomputationally expensive numerical simulations of this process are used to\nvalidate the model and fit its free parameters. The model predicts 11 $\\mu$m\nexcesses ($R_{11}$) for discs with a range of dust masses and planetesimal belt\nradii using realistic grain properties.

This data is often represented\nas $k$-mers, i.e., strings of some fixed length $k$ with symbols chosen from a\nreference alphabet. In contrast, some of the most effective and well-studied\nmachine learning algorithms require numerical representations of the data. The\nconcept of metric dimension of the so-called Hamming graphs presents a\npromising way to address this issue. A subset of vertices in a graph is said to\nbe resolving when the distances to those vertices uniquely characterize every\nvertex in the graph. The metric dimension of a graph is the size of a smallest\nresolving subset of vertices. Finding the metric dimension of a general graph\nis a challenging problem, NP-complete in fact. Recently, an efficient algorithm\nfor finding resolving sets in Hamming graphs has been proposed, which suffices\nto uniquely embed $k$-mers into a real vector space. Since the dimension of the\nembedding is the cardinality of the associated resolving set, determining\nwhether or not a node can be removed from a resolving set while keeping it\nresolving is of great interest. This can be quite challenging for large graphs\nsince only a brute-force approach is known for checking whether a set is a\nresolving set or not. In this thesis, we characterize resolvability of Hamming\ngraphs in terms of a linear system over a finite domain: a set of nodes is\nresolving if and only if the linear system has only a trivial solution over\nsaid domain. We can represent the domain as the roots of a polynomial system so\nthe apparatus of Gr\\\"obner bases comes in handy to determine, whether or not a\nset of nodes is resolving. As proof of concept, we study the resolvability of\nHamming graphs associated with octapeptides i.e. proteins sequences of length\neight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 18:36:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-06"}

One of the major challenges in controlling the\nCOVID-19 outbreak is its asymptomatic infection and transmission, which are\nelusive and defenseless in most situations. The pathogenicity and virulence of\nasymptomatic COVID-19 remain mysterious. Based on the genotyping of 20656\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome isolates,\nwe reveal that asymptomatic infection is linked to SARS-CoV-2 11083G>T\nmutation, i.e., leucine (L) to phenylalanine (F) substitution at the residue 37\n(L37F) of nonstructure protein 6 (NSP6).

Object counting takes two\ninputs: an image and an object query and reports the number of occurrences of\nthe queried object. To achieve high accuracy on such tasks, DNNs require\nbillions of operations, making them difficult to deploy on\nresource-constrained, low-power devices. Prior work shows that a significant\nnumber of DNN operations are redundant and can be eliminated without affecting\nthe accuracy. To reduce these redundancies, we propose a hierarchical DNN\narchitecture for object counting. This architecture uses a Region Proposal\nNetwork (RPN) to propose regions-of-interest (RoIs) that may contain the\nqueried objects. A hierarchical classifier then efficiently finds the RoIs that\nactually contain the queried objects. The hierarchy contains groups of visually\nsimilar object categories. Small DNNs are used at each node of the hierarchy to\nclassify between these groups. The RoIs are incrementally processed by the\nhierarchical classifier. If the object in an RoI is in the same group as the\nqueried object, then the next DNN in the hierarchy processes the RoI further;\notherwise, the RoI is discarded. By using a few small DNNs to process each\nimage, this method reduces the memory requirement, inference time, energy\nconsumption, and number of operations with negligible accuracy loss when\ncompared with the existing object counters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 20:13:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-06"}

A key issue is how to simultaneously\nanalyze often highly collinear components of the mixture, which can create\nproblems such as confounding by co-exposure and co-exposure amplification bias\n(CAB). Evaluation of novel mixtures methods, typically using synthetic data, is\ncritical to their ultimate utility. Objectives: This paper aims to answer two\nquestions. How do causal models inform the interpretation of statistical models\nand the creation of synthetic data used to test them? Are novel mixtures\nmethods susceptible to CAB? Methods: We use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and\nlinear models to derive closed form solutions for model parameters to examine\nhow underlying causal assumptions affect the interpretation of model results.\nResults: The same beta coefficients estimated by a statistical model can have\ndifferent interpretations depending on the assumed causal structure. Similarly,\nthe method used to simulate data can have implications for the underlying DAG\n(and vice versa), and therefore the identification of the parameter being\nestimated with an analytic approach. We demonstrate that methods that can\nreproduce results of linear regression, such as Bayesian kernel machine\nregression and the new quantile g-computation approach, will be subject to CAB.\nHowever, under some conditions, estimates of an overall effect of the mixture\nis not subject to CAB and even has reduced uncontrolled bias. Discussion: Just\nas DAGs encode a priori subject matter knowledge allowing identification of\nvariable control needed to block analytic bias, we recommend explicitly\nidentifying DAGs underlying synthetic data created to test statistical mixtures\napproaches. Estimates of the total effect of a mixture is an important but\nrelatively underexplored topic that warrants further investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 20:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-06"}

Arising\nnaturally from the bursty nature of Internet traffic, congestion plagues not\nonly the network edge, but also the network core. Many remedies have been\nproposed to fight congestion; active queue management (AQM) is one such\nproposal. AQM seeks to prevent congestion by actively avoiding it. Some queuing\ndisciplines such as Random Early Detection (RED) will prematurely drop a random\npacket (with some probability) when the queue nears capacity to signal the\nsender to back off. However, RED utilizes queue length as a mechanism to\nindicate congestion. On the other hand, the Controlled Delay (CoDel) queuing\ndiscipline uses queuing delay as an indication of congestion. The problem with\nboth RED and CoDel are that they indiscriminately treat all packets the same.\nNormally implemented using a FIFO queue, CoDel simply enqueues and dequeues\npackets in a first-come, first-served manner. Priority queuing can be carefully\nutilized to selectively service packets utilizing the very same metric CoDel\nuses for AQM, queuing delay. That said, Least Slack Time First (LSTF), a\nmulti-processor scheduling algorithm employs priority scheduling, which\ncoincidentally, is also based on delay. In the context of computer networks\nLSTF can be applied in the control plane or in the data plane. At the control\nplane, LSTF functions across the entire network, but in doing so requires all\nintermediary routers to implement it; LSTF also requires support at the packet\nlevel in terms of a slack entry. Within the data plane, LSTF can be implemented\nas a queuing mechanism based on delay spent in the router (just like CoDel\nAQM). This paper applies data plane level LSTF to CoDel AQM to enable\ndelay-based packet classification within the confines of the CoDel AQM\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 20:32:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-06"}

The financial status of the insurer\nis divided into solvent, insolvent and liquidated three states, where the\ninsurer's surplus process at the state of solvent and insolvent is modelled by\ntwo spectrally negative L\\'{e}vy processes, which have been taken as good\ncandidates to model insurance risks. We provide a rigorous definition of the\ntime of liquidation ruin in this three-barrier model. By adopting the\ntechniques of excursions in the fluctuation theory, we study the joint\ndistribution of the time of liquidation, the surplus at liquidation and the\nhistorical high of the surplus until liquidation, which generalizes the known\nresults on the classical expected discounted penalty function in Gerber and\nShiu (1998). The results have semi-explicit expressions in terms of the scale\nfunctions and the L\\'{e}vy triplets associated with the two underlying L\\'{e}vy\nprocesses. The special case when the two underlying L\\'{e}vy processes coincide\nwith each other is also studied, where our results are expressed compactly via\nonly the scale functions. The corresponding results have good consistency with\nthe existing literatures on Parisian ruin with (or without) a lower barrier in\nLandriault et al. (2014), Baurdoux et al. (2016) and Frostig and Keren-Pinhasik\n(2019). Besides, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the underlying\nfeatures of liquidation ruin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 22:46:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-06"}

Inverse methods are needed to interpret time-distance\nmeasurements, with many examples in the literature. However, techniques that\nutilize a more statistical approach to inferences, and broadly used in the\nastronomical community, are less-commonly found in helioseismology. This\narticle aims to introduce a potentially powerful inversion scheme based on\nBayesian probability theory and Monte Carlo sampling that is suitable for local\nhelioseismology. We describe the probabilistic method and how it is\nconceptually different from standard inversions used in local helioseismology.\nSeveral example calculations are carried out to compare and contrast the setup\nof the problems and the results that are obtained. The examples focus on two\nimportant phenomena studied with helioseismology: meridional circulation and\nsupergranulation. Numerical models are used to compute synthetic observations,\nproviding the added benefit of knowing the solution against which the results\ncan be tested. For demonstration purposes, the problems are formulated in two\nand three dimensions, using both ray- and Born-theoretical approaches. The\nresults seem to indicate that the probabilistic inversions not only find a\nbetter solution with much more realistic estimation of the uncertainties, but\nthey also provide a broader view of the range of solutions possible for any\ngiven model, making the interpretation of the inversion more quantitative in\nnature. Unlike the progress being made in fundamental measurement schemes in\nlocal helioseismology that image the far side of the Sun, or have detected\nsignatures of global Rossby waves, among many others, inversions of those\nmeasurements have had significantly less success.

Nevertheless, the notorious NP-hardness of\nBSS substantially restricts its practical application and also discourages its\ntheoretical development to some extent, particularly in the current era of big\ndata. In this paper, we investigate the variable selection properties of BSS\nwhen its target sparsity is greater than or equal to the true sparsity. Our\nmain message is that BSS is robust against design dependence in terms of\nachieving model consistency and sure screening, and more importantly, that such\nrobustness can be propagated to the near best subsets that are computationally\ntangible. Specifically, we introduce an identifiability margin condition that\nis free of restricted eigenvalues and show that it is sufficient and nearly\nnecessary for BSS to exactly recover the true model. A relaxed version of this\ncondition is also sufficient for BSS to achieve the sure screening property.\nMoreover, taking optimization error into account, we find that all the\nestablished statistical properties for the exact best subset carry over to any\nnear best subset whose residual sum of squares is close enough to that of the\nbest one. In particular, a two-stage fully corrective iterative hard\nthresholding (IHT) algorithm can provably find a sparse sure screening subset\nwithin logarithmic steps; another round of exact BSS within this set can\nrecover the true model. The simulation studies and real data examples show that\nIHT yields lower false discovery rates and higher true positive rates than the\ncompeting approaches including LASSO, SCAD and Sure Independence Screening\n(SIS), especially under highly correlated design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 03:32:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 17:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-27"}

We show theoretically\nthat combining one-dimensional spin-orbit coupling with a transverse Zeeman\nfield suppresses the effects of disorder, thereby increasing the localization\nlength and conductivity. This increase results from a suppression of back\nscattering between states in the gap of the SOC dispersion relation.

Among the approaches to securing embedded devices, dynamic firmware\nanalysis gained great attention lately, thanks to its offline nature and low\nfalse-positive rates. However, regardless of the analysis and emulation\ntechniques used, existing dynamic firmware analyzers share a major limitation,\nnamely the inability to handle firmware using DMA.

We probe this effect using the principle of magnetic LC\nresonance, which employs a soft ferromagnetic Co-based microwire coil driven\nnear its resonance in the radio frequency (RF) regime.

In particular, the\nsecondary transmitter (STx) in SR transmits messages to the secondary receiver\n(SRx) over the RF signals originating from the primary transmitter (PTx) based\non cognitive backscattering communications, thus the secondary system shares\nnot only the radio spectrum, but also the power, and infrastructure with the\nprimary system. In return, the secondary transmission provides beneficial\nmultipath diversity to the primary system, therefore the two systems form\nmutualism spectrum sharing. More importantly, joint decoding is exploited at\nSRx to achieve highly reliable backscattering communications. To exploit the\nfull potential of SR, in this paper, we address three fundamental tasks in SR:\n(1) enhancing the backscattering link via active load; (2) achieving highly\nreliable communications through joint decoding; and (3) capturing PTx's RF\nsignals using reconfigurable intelligent surfaces.

Any\ndistortion in OCT volumes can bias structural analysis and influence the\noutcome of longitudinal studies. On the other hand, presence of speckle noise\nthat is characteristic of this imaging modality, leads to inaccuracies when\ntraditional registration techniques are employed. Also, the lack of a\nwell-defined ground truth makes supervised deep-learning techniques ill-posed\nto tackle the problem. In this paper, we tackle these issues by using deep\nreinforcement learning to correct inter-frame movements in an unsupervised\nmanner. Specifically, we use dueling deep Q-network to train an artificial\nagent to find the optimal policy, i.e. a sequence of actions, that best\nimproves the alignment by maximizing the sum of reward signals. Instead of\nrelying on the ground-truth of transformation parameters to guide the rewarding\nsystem, for the first time, we use a combination of intensity based image\nsimilarity metrics.

However, such an assumption is\nrarely plausible in the real-world and possibly causes data-privacy issues,\nespecially when the label of the source domain can be a sensitive attribute as\nan identifier. To avoid accessing source data that may contain sensitive\ninformation, we introduce Source data-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA). Our key\nidea is to leverage a pre-trained model from the source domain and\nprogressively update the target model in a self-learning manner. We observe\nthat target samples with lower self-entropy measured by the pre-trained source\nmodel are more likely to be classified correctly. From this, we select the\nreliable samples with the self-entropy criterion and define these as class\nprototypes. We then assign pseudo labels for every target sample based on the\nsimilarity score with class prototypes. Furthermore, to reduce the uncertainty\nfrom the pseudo labeling process, we propose set-to-set distance-based\nfiltering which does not require any tunable hyperparameters. Finally, we train\nthe target model with the filtered pseudo labels with regularization from the\npre-trained source model.

For the dynamic traffic\nassignment problem modeled by a flow over time game, in which every particle\ntries to reach its destination as fast as possible, the dynamic equilibria are\ncalled Nash flows over time. So far, this model has only been considered for\nnetworks in which each arc is equipped with a constant capacity, limiting the\noutflow rate, and with a transit time, determining the time it takes for a\nparticle to traverse the arc. However, real-world traffic networks can be\naffected by temporal changes, for example, caused by construction works or\nspecial speed zones during some time period. To model these traffic scenarios\nappropriately, we extend the flow over time model by time-dependent capacities\nand time-dependent transit times. Our first main result is the characterization\nof the structure of Nash flows over time. Similar to the static-network model,\nthe strategies of the particles in dynamic equilibria can be characterized by\nspecific static flows, called thin flows with resetting.

One of the most well-studied optimization\nproblems for dense subgraph discovery is the densest subgraph problem, where\ngiven an edge-weighted undirected graph $G=(V,E,w)$, we are asked to find\n$S\\subseteq V$ that maximizes the density $d(S)$, i.e., half the weighted\naverage degree of the induced subgraph $G[S]$. This problem can be solved\nexactly in polynomial time and well-approximately in almost linear time.\nHowever, a densest subgraph has a structural drawback, namely, the subgraph may\nnot be robust to vertex/edge failure. Indeed, a densest subgraph may not be\nwell-connected, which implies that the subgraph may be disconnected by removing\nonly a few vertices/edges within it. In this paper, we provide an algorithmic\nframework to find a dense subgraph that is well-connected in terms of\nvertex/edge connectivity. Specifically, we introduce the following problems:\ngiven a graph $G=(V,E,w)$ and a positive integer/real $k$, we are asked to find\n$S\\subseteq V$ that maximizes the density $d(S)$ under the constraint that\n$G[S]$ is $k$-vertex/edge-connected.

In\nthis paper, we propose a highly effective method for learning instance\nembeddings based on segments by converting the compact image representation to\nun-ordered 2D point cloud representation. Our method generates a new\ntracking-by-points paradigm where discriminative instance embeddings are\nlearned from randomly selected points rather than images.

We find that our model, in a non-interacting\nregime, admits topological and trivial insulator phases, whereas, in strong\nCoulomb interaction limit, the chiral symmetry is broken and the system\nundergoes a topological-excitonic insulator phase transition. The latter phase\ntransition stems from an orbital pseudomagnetization and band inversion around\n$k=0$. Our findings show that contrary to the topological insulator phase,\nelectron-hole bound states do not form exciton condensate in the trivial band\ninsulator phase due to lack of band inversion.

Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection\nis proposed recently to reduce the disparity between domains, where the source\ndomain is label-rich while the target domain is label-agnostic. The existing\nmodels follow a parameter shared siamese structure for adversarial domain\nalignment, which, however, easily leads to the collapse and out-of-control risk\nof the source domain and brings negative impact to feature adaption. The main\nreason is that the labeling unfairness (asymmetry) between source and target\nmakes the parameter sharing mechanism unable to adapt. Therefore, in order to\navoid the source domain collapse risk caused by parameter sharing, we propose\nan asymmetric tri-way Faster-RCNN (ATF) for domain adaptive object detection.\nOur ATF model has two distinct merits: 1) A ancillary net supervised by source\nlabel is deployed to learn ancillary target features and simultaneously\npreserve the discrimination of source domain, which enhances the structural\ndiscrimination (object classification vs. bounding box regression) of domain\nalignment. 2) The asymmetric structure consisting of a chief net and an\nindependent ancillary net essentially overcomes the parameter sharing aroused\nsource risk collapse.

During the\nspreading of the monolayer, it is known that so-called \"leader cells\" generate\nthe driving force and lead the other cells.

The model reproduced\nthe quantitative characteristics obtained from the experiment, such as the\nspreading speed, the distribution of the increment, and the dynamic scaling\nlaw. Analysis of the model equation revealed that the model could reproduce the\ndifferent scaling law from ${\\alpha} = 0.5, {\\beta} = 0.25$ to ${\\alpha} = 0.9,\n{\\beta} = 0.75$, and the exponents ${\\alpha}, {\\beta}$ were determined by the\ntwo indices: $\\rho t$ and $c$.

Increasing the particle-field interaction length scale permits the\nuse of larger time steps and coarser grids. This promotes the use of multiple\ntime step strategies over the quasi-instantaneous approximation, which is found\nto not conserve energy and momenta equally well.

Fortunately, the lensing effects can be partially\nremoved by combining high-resolution $E$-mode measurements with an estimate of\nthe projected matter distribution. In the near future, experimental\ncharacteristics will be such that the latter can be reconstructed internally\nwith high fidelity from the observed CMB, with the $EB$ quadratic estimator\nproviding a large fraction of the signal-to-noise. It is a well-known\nphenomenon in this context that any overlap in modes between the $B$-field to\nbe delensed and the $B$-field from which the reconstruction is derived leads to\na suppression of delensed power going beyond that which can be attributed to a\nmitigation of the lensing effects. More importantly, the variance associated\nwith this spectrum is also reduced, posing the question of whether the\nadditional power suppression could help better constrain the tensor-to-scalar\nratio, $r$. In this paper, we show this is not the case, as suggested but not\nquantified in previous work. We develop an analytic model for the biased\ndelensed $B$-mode angular power spectrum, which suggests a simple\nrenormalisation prescription to avoid bias on the inferred tensor-to-scalar\nratio. With this approach, we learn that the bias necessarily leads to a\ndegradation of the signal-to-noise on a primordial component compared to\n\"unbiased delensing\". Next, we assess the impact of removing from the lensing\nreconstruction any overlapping $B$-modes on our ability to constrain $r$,\nshowing that it is in general advantageous to do this rather than modeling or\nrenormalising the bias. Finally, we verify these results within a\nmaximum-likelihood inference framework applied to simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 11:33:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 14:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

The other is the missing content due to the\nover-/under-saturated regions caused by the moving objects, which may not be\neasily compensated for by the multiple LDR exposures. Thus, it requires the HDR\ngeneration model to be able to properly fuse the LDR images and restore the\nmissing details without introducing artifacts.

In order to advance towards learning of general timed\nautomata, we generalize this method to a new class, called reset-free\nevent-recording automata, where some transitions may reset no clocks. This\noffers the same challenges as generic timed automata while keeping the simpler\nframework of event-recording automata for the sake of readability. Central to\nour contribution is the notion of invalidity, and the algorithm and data\nstructures to deal with it, allowing on-the-fly detection and pruning of reset\nhypotheses that contradict observations, a key to any efficient active-learning\nprocedure for generic timed automata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 12:13:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 07:30:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

In recent years, tremendous efforts have been\nseen in the lattice QCD community to derive nucleon-nucleon interactions from\nfirst principles. Because of the daunting computing resources needed, most of\nsuch simulations were still performed with larger than physical light quark\nmasses. In the present work, employing the recently proposed covariant chiral\neffective field theory (ChEFT), we study the light quark mass dependence of the\nnucleon-nucleon interaction extracted by the HALQCD group. It is shown that the\npion-full version of the ChEFT can describe the lattice QCD data with\n$m_\\pi=469$ MeV and their experimental counterpart reasonably well, while the\npion-less version can describe the lattice QCD data with $m_\\pi=672, 837, 1015,\n1171$ MeV, for both the $^1S_0$ and $^3S_1$-$^3D_1$ channels. The slightly\nbetter description of the single channel than the triplet channel indicates\nthat higher order studies are necessary for the latter. Our results confirmed\nprevious studies that the nucleon-nucleon interaction becomes more attractive\nfor both the singlet and triplet channels as the pion mass decreases towards\nits physical value. It is shown that the virtual bound state in the $^1S_0$\nchannel remains virtual down to the chiral limit, while the deuteron only\nappears for a pion mass smaller than about 400 MeV. It seems that proper chiral\nextrapolations of nucleon-nucleon interaction are possible for pion masses\nsmaller than 500 MeV, similar to the mesonic and one-baryon sectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 12:15:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 07:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

We demonstrate convergence to a dissipative\nsolution for the three-dimensional inviscid Taylor-Green problem with a\nmeasured relative $L_2$-error of $0.27 \\%$ for the temporal evolution of the\nkinetic energy and $3.52 \\%$ for the kinetic energy dissipation rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 12:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-06"}

One of the promising candidates to achieve classical\ndelegation of quantum computation is classical-client remote state preparation\n($RSP_{CC}$), where a client remotely prepares a quantum state using a\nclassical channel. However, the privacy loss incurred by employing $RSP_{CC}$\nas a sub-module is unclear.\n  In this work, we investigate this question using the Constructive\nCryptography framework by Maurer and Renner (ICS'11). We first identify the\ngoal of $RSP_{CC}$ as the construction of ideal RSP resources from classical\nchannels and then reveal the security limitations of using $RSP_{CC}$. First,\nwe uncover a fundamental relationship between constructing ideal RSP resources\n(from classical channels) and the task of cloning quantum states. Any\nclassically constructed ideal RSP resource must leak to the server the full\nclassical description (possibly in an encoded form) of the generated quantum\nstate, even if we target computational security only. As a consequence, we find\nthat the realization of common RSP resources, without weakening their\nguarantees drastically, is impossible due to the no-cloning theorem. Second,\nthe above result does not rule out that a specific $RSP_{CC}$ protocol can\nreplace the quantum channel at least in some contexts, such as the Universal\nBlind Quantum Computing (UBQC) protocol of Broadbent et al.

In other words, if we view each independent set as a collection\nof tokens placed on a subset of the vertices of $G$, then the problem asks for\na sequence of independent sets which transforms $S$ to $T$ by individual token\njumps which maintain the independence of the sets.

A closely related problem is the Token\nSliding problem, where instead of allowing a token to jump to any vertex of the\ngraph we instead require that a token slides along an edge of the graph.

Solutes are known to interact with defects generated\nby plastic deformation, thereby affecting their displacement throughout the\nmicrostructure and hence the material mechanical response to solicitation. This\neffect is studied here in a polycrystalline Ni-based superalloy with two\ndifferent Nb contents that lead to a significant change in their creep\nlifetime. Creep testing at 750C and 600 MPa shows that the high-Nb alloy\nperforms better in terms of creep strain rate. Considering the similar initial\nmicrostructures, the difference in mechanical behavior is attributed to a phase\ntransformation that occurs along planar faults, controlled by the different\ntypes of stacking faults and alloy composition. Electron channeling contrast\nimaging reveals the presence of stacking faults in both alloys. Microtwinning\nis observed only in the low-Nb alloy, rationalizing in part the higher creep\nstrain rate. In the high-Nb alloy, atom probe tomography evidences two\ndifferent types of stacking faults based on their partitioning behavior.\nSuperlattice intrinsic stacking faults (SISF) were found enriched in Nb, Co, Cr\nand Mo while only Nb and Co was segregated at superlattice extrinsic stacking\nfaults.

The\nprevious calculations are therefore incorrect, and the purpose of this paper is\nto repair the mistake. To keep the technical difficulties to a minimum, the\ntreatment here is restricted to a post-Newtonian expansion carried out to\nleading order -- previous calculations of the gravitomagnetic Love number were\nperformed in full general relativity.

Unfortunately the\nreplica method has some drawbacks: it is very hard to apply to diluted models\nand the assumptions beyond it are not immediately clear. Both drawbacks can be\novercome by the use of the cavity method, which, however, needs to be applied\nwith care to spherical models. Here we show how to write the cavity equations\nfor spherical $p$-spin models on complete graphs, both in the Replica Symmetric\n(RS) ansatz (corresponding to Belief Propagation) and in the 1-step Replica\nSymmetry Breaking (1RSB) ansatz (corresponding to Survey Propagation).

In the\nmodel snow grains are represented by randomly distributed elastic spheres\nconnected by elastic-brittle bonds. This bonded structure corresponds to\nsintered snow.

However, little is known on how\nlocal measurements compare to global measurements of expansion. Here, we\npresent results from the analysis of 42 CMEs measured in the inner heliosphere\nby two spacecraft in radial conjunction. The magnetic field decrease with\ndistance provides a measure of their global expansion. Near 1 au, the decrease\nin their bulk speed provides a measure of their local expansion. We find that\nthese two measures have little relation with each other. We also investigate\nthe relation between characteristics of CME expansion and CME properties. We\nfind that the expansion depends on the initial magnetic field strength inside\nthe ME, but not significantly on the magnetic field inside the ME measured near\n1 au. This is an indirect evidence that CME expansion in the innermost\nheliosphere is driven by the high magnetic pressure inside the ME, while by the\ntime the MEs reach 1 au, they are expanding due to the decrease in the solar\nwind dynamic pressure with distance. We also determine the evolution of the ME\ntangential and normal magnetic field components with distance, revealing\nsignificant deviations as compared to the expectations from force-free field\nconfigurations as well as some evidence that the front half of MEs expand at a\nfaster rate than the back half.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 14:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

For fast continuous sensing, it is desirable to\noperate resonant sensors in a closed-loop configuration, where a feedback loop\nensures that the resonator is always actuated near its resonance frequency, so\nthat the precision is maximized even in the presence of drifts or fluctuations\nof the resonance frequency. However, in a closed-loop configuration, the\nprecision is not only determined by the resonator itself, but also by the\nfeedback loop, even if the feedback circuit is noiseless. Therefore, to\ncharacterize the intrinsic precision of resonant sensors, the open-loop\nconfiguration is often employed. To link these measurements to the actual\nclosed-loop performance of the resonator, it is desirable to have a relation\nthat determines the closed-loop precision of the resonator from open-loop\ncharacterisation data. In this work, we present a methodology to estimate the\nclosed-loop resonant sensor precision by relying only on an open-loop\ncharacterization of the resonator. The procedure is beneficial for fast\nperformance estimation and benchmarking of resonant sensors, because it does\nnot require actual closed-loop sensor operation, thus being independent on the\nparticular implementation of the feedback loop.

These realistic pvCD-Bonn\npotentials are renormalized to effective nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) interactions,\n$G$ matrices. They are obtained by solving the Blankenbecler-Sugar (BbS)\nequation in nuclear medium. Then, the saturation properties of symmetric\nnuclear matter are calculated with pvCD-Bonn A, B, C potentials. The energies\nper nucleon are around $-10.72$ MeV to $-16.83$ MeV at saturation densities,\n$0.139$ fm$^{-3}$ to $0.192$ fm$^{-3}$ with these three potentials,\nrespectively. It clearly demonstrates that the pseudovector coupling between\npion and nucleon can generate reasonable saturation properties comparing with\npseudoscalar coupling. Furthermore, these saturation properties have strong\ncorrelations with the tensor components of $NN$ potentials, i.e., the $D$-state\nprobabilities of deuteron, $P_D$ to form a relativistic Coester band. In\naddition, the charge symmetry breaking (CSB) and charge independence breaking\n(CIB) effects are also discussed in nuclear matter from the partial wave\ncontributions with these high-precision charge-dependent potentials. In\ngeneral, the magnitudes of CSB from the differences between $nn$ and $pp$\npotentials are about $0.05$ MeV, while those of CIB are around $0.35$ MeV from\nthe differences between $np$ and $pp$ potentials. Finally, the equations of\nstate of asymmetric nuclear matter are also calculated with different asymmetry\nparameters. It is found that the effective neutron mass is larger than the\nproton one in neutron-rich matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 14:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

In the standard\ncosmological framework, subhalos are predicted to be largely abundant inside\nlarger halos, i.e., galaxies like ours, and are thought to form first and later\nmerge to form larger structures. Dwarf satellite galaxies -- the most massive\nexponents of halo substructure in our own galaxy -- are already known to be\nexcellent targets and, indeed, they are constantly scrutinized by current\ngamma-ray experiments in their search for DM annihilation signals. Lighter\nsubhalos not massive enough to have a visible baryonic counterpart may be good\ntargets as well given their typical number densities and distances. In\naddition, the clumpy distribution of subhalos residing in larger halos may\nboost the DM signals considerably. In an era in which gamma-ray experiments\npossess, for the first time, the exciting potential of reaching the most\nrelevant regions of the DM parameter space, a profound knowledge of the DM\ntargets and scenarios being tested at present is mandatory if we aim for\naccurate predictions of DM-induced fluxes, for investing significant telescope\nobserving time to selected targets, and for deriving robust conclusions from\nour DM search efforts. In this regard, a precise characterization of the\nstatistical and structural properties of subhalos becomes critical. With the\nSpecial Issue \"The Role of Halo Substructure in Gamma-Ray Dark Matter Searches\"\n[https://www.mdpi.com/journal/galaxies/special_issues/Gamma-RayDMS], we aimed\nto summarize where we stand today on our knowledge of the different aspects of\nthe DM halo substructure; to identify what are the remaining big questions, how\nwe could address these and, by doing so, to find new avenues for research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 15:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-06"}

The measured\nyields of clusters are approximately consistent with expectations from\nphenomenological statistical hadronisation models (SHMs), but a theoretical\nunderstanding of the dynamics of cluster formation prior to kinetic freeze out\nis lacking. The competing model is nuclear coalescence, which attributes\ncluster formation to the effect of final state interactions (FSI) during the\npropagation of the nuclei from kinetic freeze out to the observer. This\nphenomenon is closely related to the effect of FSI in imprinting femtoscopic\ncorrelations between continuum pairs of particles at small relative momentum\ndifference. We give a concise theoretical derivation of the\ncoalescence--correlation relation, predicting nuclear cluster spectra from\nfemtoscopic measurements. We review the fact that coalescence derives from a\nrelativistic Bethe-Salpeter equation, and recall how effective quantum\nmechanics controls the dynamics of cluster particles that are nonrelativistic\nin the cluster centre of mass frame. We demonstrate that the\ncoalescence--correlation relation is roughly consistent with the observed\ncluster spectra in systems ranging from PbPb to pPb and pp collisions. Paying\nspecial attention to nuclear wave functions, we derive the coalescence\nprediction for hypertriton and show that it, too, is roughly consistent with\nthe data. Our work motivates a combined experimental programme addressing\nfemtoscopy and cluster production under a unified framework. Upcoming pp, pPb\nand peripheral PbPb data analysed within such a programme could stringently\ntest coalescence as the origin of clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 15:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

In this paper a description of the iDBSCAN algorithm is given,\nincluding test and validation of its parameters, and a comparison with DBSCAN\nitself and a widely used algorithm known as Nearest Neighbor Clustering (NNC).\nThe results show that the adapted version of DBSCAN is capable of providing\nfull signal detection efficiency and very good energy resolution while\nimproving the detector background rejection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 15:34:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 17:51:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 17:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

Present\nembedding functions exploit user-item relationships to enrich the\nrepresentations, evolving from a single user-item instance to the holistic\ninteraction graph. Nevertheless, they largely model the relationships in a\nuniform manner, while neglecting the diversity of user intents on adopting the\nitems, which could be to pass time, for interest, or shopping for others like\nfamilies. Such uniform approach to model user interests easily results in\nsuboptimal representations, failing to model diverse relationships and\ndisentangle user intents in representations.\n  In this work, we pay special attention to user-item relationships at the\nfiner granularity of user intents. We hence devise a new model, Disentangled\nGraph Collaborative Filtering (DGCF), to disentangle these factors and yield\ndisentangled representations. Specifically, by modeling a distribution over\nintents for each user-item interaction, we iteratively refine the intent-aware\ninteraction graphs and representations. Meanwhile, we encourage independence of\ndifferent intents. This leads to disentangled representations, effectively\ndistilling information pertinent to each intent. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on three benchmark datasets, and DGCF achieves significant\nimprovements over several state-of-the-art models like NGCF, DisenGCN, and\nMacridVAE. Further analyses offer insights into the advantages of DGCF on the\ndisentanglement of user intents and interpretability of representations.

In this\npaper we focus on 3D gadgets which create a top face parallel to the ambient\npaper and two side faces sharing a ridge, with two outgoing simple pleats,\nwhere a simple pleat is a pair of a mountain fold and a valley fold. There are\ntwo such types of 3D gadgets. One is the conventional type of 3D gadgets with a\ntriangular pyramid supporting the two side faces from inside. The other is the\nnewer type of 3D gadgets presented in our previous paper, which improve the\nconventional ones in several respects: They have flat back sides above the\nambient paper and no gap between the side faces; they are less interfering with\nadjacent gadgets so that we can make the extrusion higher at one time; they are\ndownward compatible with conventional ones if constructible; they have a\nmodified flat-back gadget used for repetition which does not interfere with\nadjacent gadgets; the angles of their outgoing pleats can be changed under\ncertain conditions. However, there are cases where we can apply the\nconventional gadgets while we cannot our previous ones. The purpose of this\npaper is to improve our previous 3D gadgets to be completely downward\ncompatible with the conventional ones, in the sense that any conventional\ngadget can be replaced by our improved one with the same outgoing pleats, but\nthe converse is not always possible. To be more precise, we prove that for any\ngiven conventional 3D gadget there are an infinite number of improved 3D\ngadgets which are compatible with it, and the conventional 3D gadget can be\nreplaced with any of these 3D gadgets without affecting any other conventional\n3D gadget. Also, we see that our improved 3D gadget keep all of the above\nadvantages over the conventional ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 22:04:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

These methods are based on Bayes' theorem, which\nitself is deceptively simple. However, in practice the computations required\nare intractable even for simple cases. Hence methods for Bayesian inference\nhave historically either been significantly approximate, e.g., the Laplace\napproximation, or achieve samples from the exact solution at significant\ncomputational expense, e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Since around the\nyear 2000 so-called Variational approaches to Bayesian inference have been\nincreasingly deployed. In its most general form Variational Bayes (VB) involves\napproximating the true posterior probability distribution via another more\n'manageable' distribution, the aim being to achieve as good an approximation as\npossible. In the original FMRIB Variational Bayes tutorial we documented an\napproach to VB based that took a 'mean field' approach to forming the\napproximate posterior, required the conjugacy of prior and likelihood, and\nexploited the Calculus of Variations, to derive an iterative series of update\nequations, akin to Expectation Maximisation. In this tutorial we revisit VB,\nbut now take a stochastic approach to the problem that potentially circumvents\nsome of the limitations imposed by the earlier methodology. This new approach\nbears a lot of similarity to, and has benefited from, computational methods\napplied to machine learning algorithms. Although, what we document here is\nstill recognisably Bayesian inference in the classic sense, and not an attempt\nto use machine learning as a black-box to solve the inference problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 11:31:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 10:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

The resulting specification permits a\nflexible yet parsimonious model structure with a very low computational cost.\nThis is especially crucial at the onset of the pandemic when the data is scarce\nand the uncertainty is abundant. Full sample results show that countries\nincluding US, Brazil and Russia are still not able to contain the pandemic with\nthe US having the worst performance.

Although the\nproposed algorithm achieves near-optimal expected employment compared to the\nhindsight-optimal solution (and improves upon the status quo procedure by about\n40%), it results in a periodically imbalanced allocation to the localities over\ntime.

As a rigorous evaluation, we applied this model to the\nFashion-MNIST, MNIST, and Fruit-360 datasets, where it reduced the error rate\nto approximately one-tenth of the individual classifiers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 10:47:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 11:48:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 15:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-03"}

This system of differential\nequations is formally obtained by renormalizing the MacArthur's competition\nmodel at equilibrium, and agrees with the trait-continuous model studied by\nMirrahimi S, Perthame B, Wakano JY [J. Math. Biol. 64(7): 1189-1223, 2012]. As\na dynamical system, self-organized generation of distinct species occurs. The\nnecessary conditions for survival are given. We prove the existence of the\nevolutionary stable distribution (ESD) through an optimization problem and\npresent an independent algorithm to compute the ESD directly. Under certain\nstructural conditions, solutions of the system are shown to approach the\ndiscrete ESD as time evolves. The time discretization of the system is proven\nto satisfy two desired properties: positivity and energy dissipation. Numerical\nexamples are given to illustrate certain interesting biological phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 18:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-27"}
