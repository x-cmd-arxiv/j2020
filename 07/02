By performing measurements\nwith two distinct X-ray spectra, differences in energy-dependent attenuation\nare exploited to obtain material-specific information.

In recent years,\ngrating-based X-ray dark-field imaging has received increasing attention in the\nimaging community. The X-ray dark-field signal originates from ultra\nsmall-angle scattering within an object and thus provides information about the\nmicrostructure far below the spatial resolution of the imaging system. This\nproperty has led to a number of promising future imaging applications that are\ncurrently being investigated. However, different microstructures can hardly be\ndistinguished with current X-ray dark-field imaging techniques, since the\ndetected dark-field signal only represents the total amount of ultra\nsmall-angle scattering. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel\nconcept called dual-energy X-ray dark-field material decomposition, which\ntransfers the basic material decomposition approach from attenuation-based\ndual-energy imaging to the dark-field imaging modality.

It works straightforwardly when Huygens'\nprinciple applies, but thermalisation is more elusive if it does not apply.\nInstead, in odd dimensions we find a link to resurgence theory by noting that\nexponential relaxation is analogous to non-perturbative corrections to an\nasymptotic perturbation expansion. Without applying the power of resurgence\ntechnology we still find support for thermalisation in odd dimensions, although\nthese arguments are incomplete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 16:25:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

The simplest version of the algorithm\ninitializes with the leading $k$ principal components. Then, the principal\ncomponents are rotated with an $k \\times k$ orthogonal rotation to make them\napproximately sparse. Finally, soft-thresholding is applied to the rotated\nprincipal components. This approach differs from prior approaches because it\nuses an orthogonal rotation to approximate a sparse basis. One consequence is\nthat a sparse component need not to be a leading eigenvector, but rather a\nmixture of them.

Existence of true solutions concentrated near a given curve\nthat evolves by this law is a long-standing open question that has only been\nanswered for the special case of a circle travelling with constant speed along\nits axis, the thin vortex-rings.

I show that there is at most one 2-cell between any parallel pair of\n1-cells in the free cartesian closed bicategory on a set and hence---in terms\nof the difficulty of calculating---bring the data of cartesian closed\nbicategories down to the familiar level of cartesian closed categories.\n  In fact, I prove this result in two ways.

The key idea is to encode an image\nwith two independent components and enforce that any swapped combination maps\nto a realistic image. In particular, we encourage the components to represent\nstructure and texture, by enforcing one component to encode co-occurrent patch\nstatistics across different parts of an image. As our method is trained with an\nencoder, finding the latent codes for a new input image becomes trivial, rather\nthan cumbersome. As a result, it can be used to manipulate real input images in\nvarious ways, including texture swapping, local and global editing, and latent\ncode vector arithmetic.

Another widely held intuition is that enforcing\nmeasurements on the exchanged messages is enough to protect protocols from\nthese attacks.\n  However, the reality is much more complex. Security models dealing with\nsuperposition attacks only consider unconditional security. Conversely,\nsecurity models considering computational security assume that all supposedly\nclassical messages are measured, which forbids by construction the analysis of\nsuperposition attacks.

At the same time, the lack of safety guarantees,\nhere considered in the form of constraint satisfaction, prevents the use of\ndata-driven techniques to safety-critical distributed systems. This paper\npresents a safety framework that guarantees constraint satisfaction for\nuncertain distributed systems while learning. The framework considers linear\nsystems with coupling in the dynamics and subject to bounded parametric\nuncertainty, and makes use of robust invariance to guarantee safety. In\nparticular, a robust non-convex invariant set, given by the union of multiple\nellipsoidal invariant sets, and a nonlinear backup control law, given by the\ncombination of multiple stabilizing linear feedbacks, are computed offline. In\npresence of unsafe inputs, the safety framework applies the backup control law,\npreventing the system to violate the constraints. As the robust invariant set\nand the backup stabilizing controller are computed offline, the online\noperations reduce to simple function evaluations, which enables the use of the\nproposed framework on systems with limited computational resources. The\ncapabilities of the safety framework are illustrated by three numerical\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 18:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

However, they usually accumulate to consider\nthose statistics and deal with their relationships by estimating parameters\nblindly. This paper theoretically proves two essential facts: 1) minimizing the\nMMD equals to maximize the source and target intra-class distances respectively\nbut jointly minimize their variance with some implicit weights, so that the\nfeature discriminability degrades; 2) the relationship between the intra-class\nand inter-class distances is as one falls, another rises. Based on this, we\npropose a novel discriminative MMD. On one hand, we consider the intra-class\nand inter-class distances alone to remove a redundant parameter, and the\nrevealed weights provide their approximate optimal ranges. On the other hand,\nwe design two different strategies to boost the feature discriminability: 1) we\ndirectly impose a trade-off parameter on the implicit intra-class distance in\nMMD to regulate its change; 2) we impose the similar weights revealed in MMD on\ninter-class distance and maximize it, then a balanced factor could be\nintroduced to quantitatively leverage the relative importance between the\nfeature transferability and its discriminability.

Due to the\ndifficulty of this combinatorial problem, linear programming (LP) relaxations\nare commonly used to derive specialized message passing algorithms that are\noften interpreted as coordinate descent on the dual LP. To achieve more\ndesirable computational properties, a number of methods regularize the LP with\nan entropy term, leading to a class of smooth message passing algorithms with\nconvergence guarantees. In this paper, we present randomized methods for\naccelerating these algorithms by leveraging techniques that underlie classical\naccelerated gradient methods. The proposed algorithms incorporate the familiar\nsteps of standard smooth message passing algorithms, which can be viewed as\ncoordinate minimization steps. We show that these accelerated variants achieve\nfaster rates for finding $\\epsilon$-optimal points of the unregularized\nproblem, and, when the LP is tight, we prove that the proposed algorithms\nrecover the true MAP solution in fewer iterations than standard message passing\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 18:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

TMS requires high currents (several thousand\namperes) to be pulsed through the coil, which generates a loud acoustic impulse\nwhose peak sound pressure level (SPL) can exceed 130 dB(Z). This sound poses a\nrisk to hearing and elicits unwanted neural activation of auditory brain\ncircuits. Methods: We propose a new double-containment coil with enhanced\nwinding mounting (DCC), which utilizes acoustic impedance mismatch to contain\nand dissipate the impulsive sound within an air-tight outer casing. The coil\nwinding is potted in a rigid block, which is mounted to the outer casing by its\nacoustic nodes that are subject to minimum vibration during the pulse. The rest\nof the winding block is isolated from the casing by an air gap, and sound is\nabsorbed by foam within the casing. The casing thickness under the winding\ncenter is minimized to maximize the coil electric field output. Results:\nCompared to commercial figure-of-eight TMS coils, the DCC prototype has 10-33\ndB(Z) lower SPL at matched stimulation strength, whilst providing 22% higher\nmaximum stimulation strength than equally focal commercial coils. Conclusion:\nThe DCC design greatly reduces the acoustic noise of TMS while increasing the\nachievable stimulation strength. Significance: The acoustic noise reduction\nfrom our coil design is comparable to that provided by typical hearing\nprotection devices. This coil design approach can enhance hearing safety and\nreduce auditory co-activations in the brain and other detrimental effects of\nTMS sound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 20:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

However, their efficiency heavily relies on the\npixel-level annotations that are expensive to get and often require domain\nexpertise, especially in medical imaging. Weakly supervised semantic\nsegmentation helps to overcome these issues and also provides explainable deep\nlearning models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the semantic\nsegmentation of medical chest X-ray images with only image-level class labels\nas supervision. We improve the disease localization accuracy by combining three\napproaches as consecutive steps. First, we generate pseudo segmentation labels\nof abnormal regions in the training images through a supervised classification\nmodel enhanced with a regularization procedure. The obtained activation maps\nare then post-processed and propagated into a second classification\nmodel-Inter-pixel Relation Network, which improves the boundaries between\ndifferent object classes.

We analyze the robustness\nof the presented method and test its performance on two distinct datasets:\nPASCAL VOC 2012 and SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax. We achieve significant results in\nthe segmentation on both datasets using only image-level annotations.

We study\nnumerically the effects of these finite-$N_\\mathrm{c}$ corrections on the NLO\nBK equation. In general, we find that the finite-$N_\\mathrm{c}$ corrections are\nsmaller than the expected $1/N_\\mathrm{c}^2 \\sim 10\\%$. The corrections may be\nlarge for individual correlators, but have less of an influence on the shape of\nthe amplitude as a function of the dipole size.

Here,\nwe analyse data from two megacities: London as an example for Europe and Delhi\nas an example for Asia.

However, current SFDI\nmethods either require a sequence of several images with different illumination\npatterns or, in the case of single snapshot optical properties (SSOP),\nintroduce artifacts and sacrifice accuracy. To avoid this tradeoff, we\nintroduce OxyGAN: a data-driven, content-aware method to estimate tissue\noxygenation directly from single structured light images using end-to-end\ngenerative adversarial networks. Conventional SFDI is used to obtain ground\ntruth tissue oxygenation maps for ex vivo human esophagi, in vivo hands and\nfeet, and an in vivo pig colon sample under 659 nm and 851 nm sinusoidal\nillumination. We benchmark OxyGAN by comparing to SSOP and to a two-step hybrid\ntechnique that uses a previously-developed deep learning model to predict\noptical properties followed by a physical model to calculate tissue\noxygenation. When tested on human feet, a cross-validated OxyGAN maps tissue\noxygenation with an accuracy of 96.5%. When applied to sample types not\nincluded in the training set, such as human hands and pig colon, OxyGAN\nachieves a 93.0% accuracy, demonstrating robustness to various tissue types. On\naverage, OxyGAN outperforms SSOP and a hybrid model in estimating tissue\noxygenation by 24.9% and 24.7%, respectively. Lastly, we optimize OxyGAN\ninference so that oxygenation maps are computed ~10 times faster than previous\nwork, enabling video-rate, 25Hz imaging. Due to its rapid acquisition and\nprocessing speed, OxyGAN has the potential to enable real-time, high-fidelity\ntissue oxygenation mapping that may be useful for many clinical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 21:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Specifically, to achieve\na high synthesis accuracy, our method tackles the mode collapse issue with a\nnovel Conditional Discriminator Pool (CDP), which consists of multiple\ndiscriminators, each targeting one particular age category. To achieve strong\nidentity permanence capabilities, our method uses a novel Adversarial Triplet\nloss. This loss, which is based on the Triplet loss, adds a ranking operation\nto further pull the positive embedding towards the anchor embedding resulting\nin significantly reduced intra-class variances in the feature space. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that our proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of synthesis accuracy and identity permanence\ncapabilities, qualitatively and quantitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 22:18:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 23:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

Imitation\nlearning (IL) mitigates this shortcoming by using an oracle policy during\ntraining as a bootstrap to accelerate the learning process. However, in many\npractical situations, the learner has access to multiple suboptimal oracles,\nwhich may provide conflicting advice in a state. The existing IL literature\nprovides a limited treatment of such scenarios. Whereas in the single-oracle\ncase, the return of the oracle's policy provides an obvious benchmark for the\nlearner to compete against, neither such a benchmark nor principled ways of\noutperforming it are known for the multi-oracle setting. In this paper, we\npropose the state-wise maximum of the oracle policies' values as a natural\nbaseline to resolve conflicting advice from multiple oracles. Using a reduction\nof policy optimization to online learning, we introduce a novel IL algorithm\nMAMBA, which can provably learn a policy competitive with this benchmark. In\nparticular, MAMBA optimizes policies by using a gradient estimator in the style\nof generalized advantage estimation (GAE). Our theoretical analysis shows that\nthis design makes MAMBA robust and enables it to outperform the oracle policies\nby a larger margin than the IL state of the art, even in the single-oracle\ncase.

First, we\nsufficiently widen the deep thin network and train it until convergence. Then,\nwe use this well-trained deep wide network to warm up (or initialize) the\noriginal deep thin network. This is achieved by layerwise imitation, that is,\nforcing the thin network to mimic the intermediate outputs of the wide network\nfrom layer to layer. Finally, we further fine tune this already\nwell-initialized deep thin network. The theoretical guarantee is established by\nusing the neural mean field analysis. It demonstrates the advantage of our\nlayerwise imitation approach over backpropagation. We also conduct large-scale\nempirical experiments to validate the proposed method. By training with our\nmethod, ResNet50 can outperform ResNet101, and BERT Base can be comparable with\nBERT Large, when ResNet101 and BERT Large are trained under the standard\ntraining procedures as in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 23:34:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 17:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

The\nnoise-removal process (denoising) can be performed by filtering the surface\nnormals first and by adjusting the vertex positions according to filtered\nnormals afterwards. Therefore, in many available denoising algorithms, the\ncomputation of noise-free normals is a key factor. A variety of filters have\nbeen introduced for noise-removal from normals, with different focus points\nlike robustness against outliers or large amplitude of noise.

A particular class of examples concerns\ninteracting spin-1/2 fermions on a lattice consisting of $N$ sites (it includes\ndeformations of the Fermi-Hubbard model as special cases), and we show that it\ncontains two families of $N+1$ scar states. One of these families, which was\nfound in recent literature, is comprised of the well-known $\\eta$-pairing\nstates. We find another family of scar states which is $U(N)$ invariant.

Such states could be used for reliable quantum information processing\nbecause the information is stored non-locally, and thus cannot be easily erased\nby local perturbations. In contrast, other scar states we find are product\nstates which could be easily prepared experimentally. The dimension of scar\nsubspace is directly controlled by the choice of group $G$ and can be made\nexponentially large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 02:51:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 17:34:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 19:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

To solve these problems, we propose an overall scheme of the\nline-of-sight multi-carrier and multi-mode OAM (LoS MCMM-OAM) communication\nbased on uniform circular arrays (UCAs). First, we verify that UCA can generate\nmulti-mode OAM radio beam with both the RF analog synthesis method and the\nbaseband digital synthesis method. Then, for the considered UCA-based LoS\nMCMM-OAM communication system, a distance and AoA estimation method is proposed\nbased on the two-dimensional ESPRIT (2-D ESPRIT) algorithm. A salient feature\nof the proposed LoS MCMM-OAM and LoS MCMM-OAM-MIMO systems is that the channel\nmatrices are completely characterized by three parameters, namely, the azimuth\nangle, the elevation angle and the distance, independent of the numbers of\nsubcarriers and antennas, which significantly reduces the burden by avoiding\nestimating large channel matrices, as traditional MIMO-OFDM systems.

The proposed visual system model features bio-plausible ON and OFF\npathways, wide-field horizontal-sensitive (HS) and vertical-sensitive (VS)\nsystems. The main contributions of this research are on two aspects: 1) the\nproposed model articulates the forming of both direction-selective (DS) and\ndirection-opponent (DO) responses, revealed as principal features of motion\nperception neural circuits, in a feed-forward manner; 2) it also shows robust\ndirection selectivity to translating objects in front of cluttered moving\nbackgrounds, via the modelling of spatiotemporal dynamics including combination\nof motion pre-filtering mechanisms and ensembles of local correlators inside\nboth the ON and OFF pathways, which works effectively to suppress irrelevant\nbackground motion or distractors, and to improve the dynamic response.\nAccordingly, the direction of translating objects is decoded as global\nresponses of both the HS and VS systems with positive or negative output\nindicating preferred-direction (PD) or null-direction (ND) translation.

Previous studies suggested that the Gaussianity of EEG distributions\nchanges depending on the presence or absence of seizures; however, no general\nEEG signal models can explain such changes in distributions within a unified\nscheme. Methods: This paper describes the formulation of a stochastic EEG model\nbased on a multivariate scale mixture distribution that can represent changes\nin non-Gaussianity caused by stochastic fluctuations in EEG. In addition, we\npropose an EEG analysis method by combining the model with a filter bank and\nintroduce a feature representing the non-Gaussianity latent in each EEG\nfrequency band. Results: We applied the proposed method to multichannel EEG\ndata from twenty patients with focal epilepsy.

The feature calculated in the high-frequency band allowed\nhighly accurate classification of seizure and non-seizure segments [area under\nthe receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.881] using only a simple\nthreshold. Conclusion: This paper proposed a multivariate scale mixture\ndistribution-based stochastic EEG model capable of representing non-Gaussianity\nassociated with epileptic seizures.

In this paper,\nwe present a vision-based method to automate the suture thread grasping, which\nis a sub-task in surgical knot tying and an intermediate step between the\nstitching and looping manipulations. To achieve this goal, the acquisition of a\nsuture's three-dimensional (3D) information is critical. Towards this\nobjective, we adopt a transfer-learning strategy first to fine-tune a\npre-trained model by learning the information from large legacy surgical data\nand images obtained by the on-site equipment.

We\nfurther leverage a searching strategy with termination policies for a suture's\nsequence inference based on the analysis of multiple topologies. Exact results\nof the pixel-level sequence along a suture can be obtained, and they can be\nfurther applied for a 3D shape reconstruction using our optimized shortest path\napproach.

The extensive coverage of the outbursts with \\textit{MAXI} is\nused to obtain the Hardness Intensity Diagram (HID). The source follows a\n`c'-shaped profile in agreement with earlier findings. Based on the HIDs of\nprevious outbursts, we attempt to track the evolution of the source during a\n`super'-outburst and `mini'-outbursts. We model the broadband energy spectra\n($0.7-20.0$ keV) of \\textit{AstroSat} observations of both outbursts using\nphenomenological and physical models. No Keplerian disc signature is observed\nat the beginning of 2016 outburst. However, the disc appears within a few hours\nafter which it remains prominent with temperature ($T_{in}$) $\\sim$ 1.3 keV and\nincrease in photon index ($\\Gamma$) from 1.8 to 2.0, whereas the source was at\na disc dominant state throughout the \\textit{AstroSat} campaign of 2018\noutburst. Based on the HIDs and spectral properties, we classify the outbursts\ninto three different states - the `canonical' hard and soft states along with\nan intermediate state. Evolution of rms along different states is seen although\nno Quasi-periodic Oscillations (QPOs) are detected. We fit the observed spectra\nusing a dynamical accretion model and estimate the accretion parameters. Mass\nof the black hole is estimated using inner disc radius, bolometric luminosity\nand two component flow model to be $3-9$ $M_{\\odot}$. Finally, we discuss the\npossible implications of our findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 07:08:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 04:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

Over the years several\nmethods of chaos detection have been developed. Some of them, such as the\nconstruction of the system's Poincar\\'e Surface of Section, are appropriate for\nlow-dimensional systems. However, an enormous number of real-world problems are\ndescribed by high-dimensional systems. Thus, modern numerical methods like the\nSmaller (SALI) and the Generalized (GALI) Alignment Index, which can also be\nused for lower-dimensional systems, are appropriate for investigating regular\nand chaotic motion in high-dimensional systems. In this work, we numerically\ninvestigate the behavior of the GALIs in the neighborhood of simple stable\nperiodic orbits of the well-known Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice model. In\nparticular, we study how the values of the GALIs depend on the width of the\nstability island and the system's energy. We find that the asymptotic GALI\nvalues increase when the studied regular orbits move closer to the edge of the\nstability island for fixed energy, while these indices decrease as the system's\nenergy increases. We also investigate the dependence of the GALIs on the\ninitial distribution of the coordinates of the deviation vectors used for their\ncomputation and the corresponding angles between these vectors. In this case,\nwe show that the final constant values of the GALIs are independent of the\nchoice of the initial deviation vectors needed for their computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 07:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

We claim, however, that it\nis redundant if one reduces the requirement of finiteness to S-matrix elements\nonly and does not require finiteness of intermediate quantities like the\noff-shell Green functions. We suggest a novel view on the renormalization\nprocedure. It is based on the usual BPHZ R-operation, which is equally\napplicable to any local QFT, renormalizable or not. The key point is the\nreplacement of the multiplicative renormalization, used in renormalizable\ntheories, by an operation when the renormalization constants depend on the\nfields and momenta that have to be integrated inside the subgraphs. This\napproach does not distinguish between renormalizable and non-renormalizable\ninteractions and provides the basis for getting finite scattering amplitudes in\nboth cases. The arbitrariness of the subtraction procedure is fixed by imposing\na normalization condition on the scattering amplitude as a whole rather than on\nan infinite series of new operators appearing in non-renormalizable theories.\n  Using the property of locality of counter-terms, we get recurrence relations\nconnecting leading, subleading, etc., UV divergences in all orders of PT in any\nlocal theory. This allows one to get generalized RG equations that have an\nintegro-differential form and sum up the leading logarithms. This way one can\ncure the problem of violation of unitarity in non-renormalizable theories by\nsumming up the leading asymptotics. We illustrate the basic features of our\napproach by several examples.\n  Our main statement is that non-renormalizable theories are self-consistent,\nthey can be well treated within the usual BPHZ R-operation, and the\narbitrariness can be fixed to a finite number of parameters just as in the\nrenormalizable case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 07:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

It is common to assume that\nthe models are Markov, but the assumption can often be unrealistic. The Markov\nassumption is seldomly checked and violations can lead to biased estimation for\nmany parameters of interest. As argued by Datta and Satten (2001), the\nAalen-Johansen estimator of occupation probabilities is consistent also in the\nnon-Markov case. Putter and Spitoni (2018) exploit this fact to construct a\nconsistent estimator of state transition probabilities, the landmark\nAalen-Johansen estimator, which does not rely on the Markov assumption. A\ndisadvantage of landmarking is data reduction, leading to a loss of power. This\nis problematic for less traveled transitions, and undesirable when such\ntransitions indeed exhibit Markov behaviour. Using a framework of partially\nnon-Markov multi-state models we suggest a hybrid landmark Aalen-Johansen\nestimator for transition probabilities.

In\nthis paper, we propose a DRL based robotic visual grasping framework, in which\nvisual perception and control policy are trained separately rather than\nend-to-end.

To tackle such\nchallenges, we propose a position-guided deformable UNet, namely PGD-UNet,\nwhich exploits the spatial deformation capabilities of deformable convolution\nto deal with the geometric transformation of both organs and tumors. Position\ninformation is explicitly encoded into the network to enhance the capabilities\nof deformation.

Besides, due\nto unclear boundaries between different structures as well as the subjectivity\nof annotations, labels are not necessarily accurate for medical image\nsegmentation tasks.

It requires grid operators to solve\nalternative current optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problems more frequently for\neconomical and reliable operation in both transmission and distribution grids.\nIn this paper, we develop a Deep Neural Network (DNN) approach, called DeepOPF,\nfor solving AC-OPF problems in a fraction of the time used by conventional\nsolvers. A key difficulty for applying machine learning techniques for solving\nAC-OPF problems lies in ensuring that the obtained solutions respect the\nequality and inequality physical and operational constraints. Generalized the\n2-stage procedure in [1], [2], DeepOPF first trains a DNN model to predict a\nset of independent operating variables and then directly compute the remaining\ndependable ones by solving power flow equations. Such an approach not only\npreserves the power-flow balance equality constraints but also reduces the\nnumber of variables to predict by the DNN, cutting down the number of neurons\nand training data needed. DeepOPF then employs a penalty approach with a\nzero-order gradient estimation technique in the training process to preserve\nthe remaining inequality constraints. As another contribution, we drive a\ncondition for tuning the size of the DNN according to the desired approximation\naccuracy, which measures the DNN generalization capability. It provides\ntheoretical justification for using DNN to solve the AC-OPF problem. Simulation\nresults of IEEE 30/118/300-bus and a synthetic 2000-bus test cases show that\nDeepOPF speeds up the computing time by up to two orders of magnitude as\ncompared to a state-of-the-art solver, at the expense of $<$0.1% cost\ndifference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 10:26:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 15:04:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 11:32:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 12:11:08 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 04:18:14 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 04:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

The training set is used\nfor training the model while the validation set is used to estimate the\ngeneralization performance of the trained model as the training proceeds to\navoid over-fitting. There exist two major issues in this paradigm. Firstly, the\nvalidation set may hardly guarantee an unbiased estimate of generalization\nperformance due to potential mismatching with test data. Secondly, training a\nDNN corresponds to solve a complex optimization problem, which is prone to\ngetting trapped into inferior local optima and thus leads to undesired training\nresults.

The knowledge transfer mechanism featured\nin this new framework can not only enhance training effectiveness by helping\nthe model training process to escape from local optima but also improve on\ngeneralization performance via implicit regularization imposed on one model\ntraining process from other model training processes.

Like in the two-valued case, the wide variation found in system\ntypes creates a need for generic methods that apply to many system types at\nonce. Approaches of this kind are emerging within the paradigm of universal\ncoalgebra, based either on lifting pseudometrics along set functors or on\nlifting general real-valued (fuzzy) relations along functors by means of fuzzy\nlax extensions. An immediate benefit of the latter is that they allow bounding\nbehavioural distance by means of fuzzy (bi-)simulations that need not\nthemselves be hemi- or pseudometrics; this is analogous to classical\nsimulations and bisimulations, which need not be preorders or equivalence\nrelations, respectively. The known generic pseudometric liftings, specifically\nthe generic Kantorovich and Wasserstein liftings, both can be extended to yield\nfuzzy lax extensions, using the fact that both are effectively given by a\nchoice of quantitative modalities.

One of\nthe most popular solutions that have emerged is the use of video conferencing\napplications to replace face-to-face meetings with virtual meetings. This\nresulted in unprecedented growth in the number of video conferencing users. In\nthis study, we explored privacy issues that may be at risk by attending virtual\nmeetings. We extracted private information from collage images of meeting\nparticipants that are publicly posted on the Web. We used image processing,\ntext recognition tools, as well as social network analysis to explore our web\ncrawling curated dataset of over 15,700 collage images, and over 142,000 face\nimages of meeting participants. We demonstrate that video conference users are\nfacing prevalent security and privacy threats. Our results indicate that it is\nrelatively easy to collect thousands of publicly available images of video\nconference meetings and extract personal information about the participants,\nincluding their face images, age, gender, usernames, and sometimes even full\nnames. This type of extracted data can vastly and easily jeopardize people's\nsecurity and privacy both in the online and real-world, affecting not only\nadults but also more vulnerable segments of society, such as young children and\nolder adults. Finally, we show that cross-referencing facial image data with\nsocial network data may put participants at additional privacy risks they may\nnot be aware of and that it is possible to identify users that appear in\nseveral video conference meetings, thus providing a potential to maliciously\naggregate different sources of information about a target individual.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 12:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

For that, we run a\ngrid of chemical models which include TiO formation and destruction, for the\nultra-hot Jupiter WASP-19b and an ultra-hot version of HD~209458b. We take into\naccount non-equilibrium chemistry and changes in the temperature and pressure\nstructure of these atmospheres caused by different C/O ratios.

ICN supports the use of multiple paths; however, with\nmultiple consumers and producers, coordination among the nodes is required to\nefficiently use the network resources. Network coding (NC) is a promising tool\nto address this issue. The challenge in the case of NC is to be able to get\nindependent coded content in response to multiple parallel interests by one or\nseveral consumers.

We find that such\nan impact typically leads to less than 10 particles being ejected from the\ngranular bed, with typical ejecta trajectories rising to less than one particle\ndiameter above the surface. That is, the observed impacts are highly\ndissipative and only a small fraction of the impact energy is imparted onto the\nejecta.

This has traditionally been carried\nout in uncompressed documents, although most of the documents in real life\nexist in a compressed form warranted by the requirement to make storage and\ntransfer efficient. However, carrying out page segmentation directly in\ncompressed documents without going through the stage of decompression is a\nchallenging goal. This research paper proposes demonstrating the possibility of\ncarrying out a page segmentation operation directly in the run-length data of\nthe CCITT Group-3 compressed text document, which could be single- or\nmulti-columned and might even have some text regions in the inverted text color\nmode. Therefore, before carrying out the segmentation of the text document into\ncolumns, each column into paragraphs, each paragraph into text lines, each line\ninto words, and, finally, each word into characters, a pre-processing of the\ntext document needs to be carried out. The pre-processing stage identifies the\nnormal text regions and inverted text regions, and the inverted text regions\nare toggled to the normal mode. In the sequel to initiate column separation, a\nnew strategy of incremental assimilation of white space runs in the vertical\ndirection and the auto-estimation of certain related parameters is proposed. A\nprocedure to realize column-segmentation employing these extracted parameters\nhas been devised. Subsequently, what follows first is a two-level horizontal\nrow separation process, which segments every column into paragraphs, and in\nturn, into text-lines. Then, there is a two-level vertical column separation\nprocess, which completes the separation into words and characters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 14:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

We have detected the three\nhyperfine structure components of the 2THz frequency transition from its\nground-state toward four high-mass star-forming regions and determine 13CH\ncolumn densities.

However,\nthe training of deep SNNs is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel ANN-to-SNN conversion and layer-wise learning framework for rapid and\nefficient pattern recognition, which is referred to as progressive tandem\nlearning of deep SNNs. By studying the equivalence between ANNs and SNNs in the\ndiscrete representation space, a primitive network conversion method is\nintroduced that takes full advantage of spike count to approximate the\nactivation value of analog neurons. To compensate for the approximation errors\narising from the primitive network conversion, we further introduce a\nlayer-wise learning method with an adaptive training scheduler to fine-tune the\nnetwork weights. The progressive tandem learning framework also allows hardware\nconstraints, such as limited weight precision and fan-in connections, to be\nprogressively imposed during training. The SNNs thus trained have demonstrated\nremarkable classification and regression capabilities on large-scale object\nrecognition, image reconstruction, and speech separation tasks, while requiring\nat least an order of magnitude reduced inference time and synaptic operations\nthan other state-of-the-art SNN implementations.

In this article, a theoretical and practical\ndesign methodology is developed to address this problem. First, the information\ngranulation (Fuzzy C-Means) method is applied to capture the structure in the\ndata and split the input space into subspaces, as well as form the antecedent\nparts. Second, the quadratic polynomials (QPs) are employed as the consequent\nparts.

However, although QP can\nimprove the approximation ability of the model, it could lead to the\ndeterioration of the prediction ability of the model (e.g., overfitting).

The advantage of el 2 compared to ordinary l2 lies in separately\nidentifying and penalizing different types of polynomial terms in the\ncoefficient estimation, and its results not only alleviate the overfitting and\nprevent the deterioration of generalization ability but also effectively\nrelease the prediction potential of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 15:42:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

One problem of those methods\nis lacking of topology guarantee for segmented objects, and usually post\nprocessing is needed to infer the boundary surface of the object.

The first\nmethod is Reversed Loss Function Ensemble, where the adversary can craft\nqualified examples from the gradients of a reversed loss function.

Research on\nefficient convolutional neural networks (CNNs) aims at removing feature\nredundancy by decomposing or optimizing the convolutional calculation. In this\nwork, feature redundancy is assumed to exist among channels in CNN\narchitectures, which provides some leeway to boost calculation efficiency.\nAiming at channel compression, a novel convolutional construction named compact\nconvolution is proposed to embrace the progress in spatial convolution, channel\ngrouping and pooling operation. Specifically, the depth-wise separable\nconvolution and the point-wise interchannel operation are utilized to\nefficiently extract features.

To explore the rules on reducing\nchannel redundancy in neural networks, the comparison is made among different\npoint-wise interchannel operations. Moreover, compact convolutions are extended\nto tackle with multiple tasks, such as acoustic scene classification, sound\nevent detection and image classification.

The image-forming current for multiple tips in STM\nis derived in a more straightforward manner than prior approaches. The Fourier\nspectrum of the current for p4mm Bloch surface wave functions and a pair of\ndelta function tips reveals the tip-separation dependence of various types of\nimage obscurations.

To better constrain this emission, we\nperform the Monte Carlo simulation of H$\\alpha$ emission, which comprises\ndirect and scattered H$\\alpha$ radiation from HII regions and warm ionized\nmedium (WIM). The positions and radii of HII regions are quoted from the WISE\nHII catalog, and the WIM is described by an axisymmetric model.

In this approach, each intersection is\nmodeled as an agent that plays a Markovian Game against the other intersection\nnodes in a traffic signal network modeled as an undirected graph, to approach\nthe optimal reduction in delay. Following Partially Observable Markov Decision\nProcesses (POMDPs), there are 3 levels of communication schemes between\nadjacent learning agents: independent deep Q-leaning (IDQL), shared states\nreinforcement learning (S2RL) and a shared states & rewards version of\nS2RL--S2R2L. In these 3 variants of decentralized MARL schemes, individual\nagent trains its local deep Q network (DQN) separately, enhanced by\nconvergence-guaranteed techniques like double DQN, prioritized experience\nreplay, multi-step bootstrapping, etc. To test the performance of the proposed\nthree MARL algorithms, a SUMO-based simulation platform is developed to mimic\nthe traffic evolution of the real world. Fed with random traffic demand between\npermitted OD pairs, a 4x4 Manhattan-style grid network is set up as the\ntestbed, two different vehicle arrival rates are generated for model training\nand testing. The experiment results show that S2R2L has a quicker convergence\nrate and better convergent performance than IDQL and S2RL in the training\nprocess. Moreover, three MARL schemes all reveal exceptional generalization\nabilities. Their testing results surpass the benchmark Max Pressure (MP)\nalgorithm, under the criteria of average vehicle delay, network-level queue\nlength and fuel consumption rate. Notably, S2R2L has the best testing\nperformance of reducing 34.55% traffic delay and dissipating 10.91% queue\nlength compared with MP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 06:58:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 23:15:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

Recently, Capsule\nNetworks (CapsNets) are proposed for image classification. It has been shown\nthat CapsNets have several advantages over Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs), while their validity in the domain of text has been less explored. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel hybrid architecture viz., BGCapsule, which is a\nCapsule model preceded by an ensemble of Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units\n(BiGRU) for several text classification tasks. We employed an ensemble of\nBidirectional GRUs for feature extraction layer preceding the primary capsule\nlayer. The hybrid architecture, after performing basic pre-processing steps,\nconsists of five layers: an embedding layer based on GloVe, a BiGRU based\nensemble layer, a primary capsule layer, a flatten layer and fully connected\nReLU layer followed by a fully connected softmax layer. In order to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of BGCapsule, we conducted extensive experiments on five\nbenchmark datasets (ranging from 10,000 records to 700,000 records) including\nMovie Review (MR Imdb 2005), AG News dataset, Dbpedia ontology dataset, Yelp\nReview Full dataset and Yelp review polarity dataset.

In this paper,\nwe propose learning explanations of expert decisions by modeling their reward\nfunction in terms of preferences with respect to \"what if\" outcomes: Given the\ncurrent history of observations, what would happen if we took a particular\naction? To learn these cost-benefit tradeoffs associated with the expert's\nactions, we integrate counterfactual reasoning into batch inverse reinforcement\nlearning. This offers a principled way of defining reward functions and\nexplaining expert behavior, and also satisfies the constraints of real-world\ndecision-making -- where active experimentation is often impossible (e.g. in\nhealthcare). Additionally, by estimating the effects of different actions,\ncounterfactuals readily tackle the off-policy nature of policy evaluation in\nthe batch setting, and can naturally accommodate settings where the expert\npolicies depend on histories of observations rather than just current states.\nThrough illustrative experiments in both real and simulated medical\nenvironments, we highlight the effectiveness of our batch, counterfactual\ninverse reinforcement learning approach in recovering accurate and\ninterpretable descriptions of behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 14:24:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 13:14:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 17:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

In this context, a powerful network analysis approach\nwith a mathematical foundation is indispensable to understand the mechanism of\nneuropathological events spreading throughout the brain. Indeed, the topology\nof each brain network is governed by its native harmonic waves, which are a set\nof orthogonal bases derived from the Eigen-system of the underlying Laplacian\nmatrix. To that end, we propose a novel connectome harmonic analysis framework\nto provide enhanced mathematical insights by detecting frequency-based\nalterations relevant to brain disorders. The backbone of our framework is a\nnovel manifold algebra appropriate for inference across harmonic waves that\novercomes the limitations of using classic Euclidean operations on irregular\ndata structures. The individual harmonic difference is measured by a set of\ncommon harmonic waves learned from a population of individual Eigen systems,\nwhere each native Eigen-system is regarded as a sample drawn from the Stiefel\nmanifold. Specifically, a manifold optimization scheme is tailored to find the\ncommon harmonic waves which reside at the center of Stiefel manifold. To that\nend, the common harmonic waves constitute the new neuro-biological bases to\nunderstand disease progression. Each harmonic wave exhibits a unique\npropagation pattern of neuro-pathological burdens spreading across brain\nnetworks. The statistical power of our novel connectome harmonic analysis\napproach is evaluated by identifying frequency-based alterations relevant to\nAlzheimer's disease, where our learning-based manifold approach discovers more\nsignificant and reproducible network dysfunction patterns compared to Euclidian\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 20:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}
