To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel watermark\nsynchronization process and the corresponding watermarking scheme. In our\nscheme, the watermark bits are represented by random patterns. The message is\nencoded to get a watermark unit, and the watermark unit is flipped to generate\na symmetrical watermark. Then the symmetrical watermark is embedded into the\nspatial domain of the host image in an additive way. In watermark extraction,\nwe first get the theoretically mean-square error minimized estimation of the\nwatermark. Then the auto-convolution function is applied to this estimation to\ndetect the symmetry and get a watermark units map. According to this map, the\nwatermark can be accurately synchronized, and then the extraction can be done.\nExperimental results demonstrate the excellent robustness of the proposed\nwatermarking scheme to local geometric distortions, global geometric\ndistortions, common image processing operations, and some kinds of combined\nattacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 16:27:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

As modern data sets grow, so does the need to scale active search to\nlarge data sets and batch sizes. In this paper, we present a general\nhierarchical framework based on bandit algorithms to scale active search to\nlarge batch sizes by maximizing information derived from the unique structure\nof each dataset. Our hierarchical framework, Hierarchical Batch Bandit Search\n(HBBS), strategically distributes batch selection across a learned embedding\nspace by facilitating wide exploration of different structural elements within\na dataset. We focus our application of HBBS on modern biology, where large\nbatch experimentation is often fundamental to the research process, and\ndemonstrate batch design of biological sequences (protein and DNA). We also\npresent a new Gym environment to easily simulate diverse biological sequences\nand to enable more comprehensive evaluation of active search methods across\nheterogeneous data sets. The HBBS framework improves upon standard performance,\nwall-clock, and scalability benchmarks for batch search by using a broad\nexploration strategy across coarse partitions and fine-grained exploitation\nwithin each partition of structured data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 16:50:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

The\nchromosphere is known for its 3-minute signals, which are particularly strong\nover sunspot umbrae. These signals are thought to be driven by photospheric\ndisturbances and their periods determined by the chromosphere's acoustic\ncut-off frequency. A small number of observations have shown the chromospheric\n3-minute signals to be affected by energetic events such as solar flares,\nhowever the link between flare activity and these oscillatory signals remains\nunclear. In this work we present evidence of changes to the oscillatory\nstructure of the chromosphere over a sunspot which occurs during the impulsive\nphase of an M1 flare. Using imaging data from the CRISP instrument across the\nH$\\alpha$ and Ca II 8542 {\\AA} spectral lines, we employed a method of fitting\nmodels to power spectra to produce maps of areas where there is evidence of\noscillatory signals above a red noise background. Comparing results taken\nbefore and after the impulsive phase of the flare, we found that the\noscillatory signals taken after the start of the flare differ in two ways: the\nlocations of oscillatory signals had changed and the typical periods of the\noscillations had tended to increase (in some cases increasing from $\\lt$100s to\n$\\sim$200s). Both of these results can be explained by a restructuring of the\nmagnetic field in the chromosphere during the flare activity, which is backed\nup by images of coronal loops showing clear changes to magnetic connectivity.\nThese results represent one of the many ways that active regions can be\naffected by solar flare events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 17:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Its origins are vital to understanding the\nformation of other Kupier-belt objects (KBO) and binaries, and the evolution of\nthe outer solar-system. The Pluto-Charon system is believed to form following a\ngiant impact between two massive KBOs at relatively low velocities. However,\nthe likelihood of a random direct collision between two of the most massive\nKBOs is low, and is further constrained by the requirement of a low-velocity\ncollision, making this a potentially fine-tuned scenario. Here we expand our\nprevious studies and suggest that the proto-Pluto-Charon system was formed as a\nhighly inclined wide-binary, which was then driven through\nsecular/quasi-secular evolution into a direct impact. Since wide-binaries are\nubiquitous in the Kuiper-belt with many expected to be highly inclined, our\nscenario is expected to be robust. We use analytic tools and few-body\nsimulations of the triple Sun-(proto-)Pluto-Charon system to show that a large\nparameter-space of initial conditions leads to such collisions. The velocity of\nsuch an impact is the escape velocity of a bound system, which naturally\nexplains the low-velocity impact.

It might complete the\npreheating of the Universe if appropriate conditions are satisfied, especially\nin the Higgs-like regime. In this paper, we study this behavior in more depth,\nincluding the conditions for occurrence, analytical estimates for the maximal\nefficiency, and the necessary degree of fine-tuning among the model parameters\nto complete preheating by this effect. We find that the parameter sets that\ncause the most efficient tachyonic instabilities obey simple laws in both the\nHiggs-like regime and the $R^2$-like regime, respectively. We then estimate the\nefficiency of this instability.

The existence of a\ncompact color-flavor-spin singlet sexaquark (S, uuddss) with mass ~2m_p, is\ncompatible with current knowledge. The S interacts with baryons primarily via a\nYukawa interaction of coupling strength alpha_SN, mediated by omega and phi\nvector mesons having mass ~1 GeV. If it exists, the S is a very attractive DM\ncandidate. The relic abundance of S Dark Matter (SDM) is established when the\nUniverse transitions from the quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic phase at ~150\nMeV and is in remarkable agreement with the observed Omega_DM/Omega_b =\n5.3+-0.1; this is a no-free-parameters result because the relevant parameters\nare known from QCD. Survival of this relic abundance to low temperature\nrequires the breakup amplitude gtilde <~ 2 10^-6, comfortably compatible with\ntheory expectations and observational bounds because the breakup amplitude is\ndynamically suppressed and many orders of magnitude smaller, as we show. The\nscattering cross section can differ by orders of magnitude from Born\napproximation, depending on alpha_SN, requiring reanalysis of observational\nlimits. We use direct detection experiments and cosmological constraints to\ndetermine the allowed region of alpha_SN. For a range of allowed values, we\npredict exotic nuclear isotopes at a detectable level with mass offset ~2 amu.\nThe most promising approaches for detecting the sexaquark in accelerator\nexperiments are to search for a long-interaction-length neutral particle\ncomponent in the central region of relativistic heavy ion collisions or using a\nbeam-dump setup, and to search for evidence of missing particle production\ncharacterized by unbalanced baryon number and strangeness using Belle-II or\npossibly GLUEX at J-Lab.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 18:03:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 16:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-17"}

We show that for rings $R$ essentially of finite\ntype over complete local rings of characteristic $p$, reducedness implies the\n$R$-solidity of $R^{1/p}$, $F$-purity implies Frobenius splitting, and $F$-pure\nregularity implies split $F$-regularity. We demonstrate that Henselizations and\ncompletions are not solid, providing obstructions for the $R$-solidity of\n$R^{1/p}$ for arbitrary excellent rings. This also has negative consequences\nfor the solidity of big Cohen-Macaulay algebras, an important example of which\nare absolute integral closures of excellent local rings in prime\ncharacteristic.

This picture is profoundly different from the dominant electron\nhopping mechanism supported by the same protein in aqueous solution. Our\nresults imply that current output in MHC junctions could be even further\nincreased in the resonant regime, e.g. by application of a gate voltage, making\nthese proteins extremely interesting for next-generation bionanoelectronic\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 18:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

However, VAEs are known to suffer\nfrom over-regularization which can lead to failure to escape local maxima. This\nphenomenon, known as posterior collapse, prevents learning a meaningful latent\nencoding of the data. Recent methods have mitigated this issue by\ndeterministically moment-matching an aggregated posterior distribution to an\naggregate prior. However, abandoning a probabilistic framework (and thus\nrelying on point estimates) can both lead to a discontinuous latent space and\ngenerate unrealistic samples. Here we present Hierarchical Empirical Bayes\nAutoencoder (HEBAE), a computationally stable framework for probabilistic\ngenerative models. Our key contributions are two-fold. First, we make gains by\nplacing a hierarchical prior over the encoding distribution, enabling us to\nadaptively balance the trade-off between minimizing the reconstruction loss\nfunction and avoiding over-regularization. Second, we show that assuming a\ngeneral dependency structure between variables in the latent space produces\nbetter convergence onto the mean-field assumption for improved posterior\ninference. Overall, HEBAE is more robust to a wide-range of hyperparameter\ninitializations than an analogous VAE. Using data from MNIST and CelebA, we\nillustrate the ability of HEBAE to generate higher quality samples based on FID\nscore than existing autoencoder-based approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 18:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

If\ndark matter self-annihilates, these objects turn into prime targets for\nindirect searches, in particular with gamma-ray telescopes. Incidentally, the\nFermi-LAT catalog already contains many unidentified sources that might be\nassociated with subhalos. In this paper, we determine the probability for\nsubhalos to be identified as gamma-ray pointlike sources from their predicted\ndistribution properties. We use a semi-analytical model for the Galactic\nsubhalo population, which, in contrast to cosmological simulations, can be made\nfully consistent with current kinematic constraints in the Milky Way and has no\nresolution limit. The model incorporates tidal stripping effects from a\nrealistic distribution of baryons in the Milky Way. The same baryonic\ndistribution contributes a diffuse gamma-ray foreground which adds up to that,\noften neglected in subhalo searches, generated by the smooth dark matter and\nthe unresolved subhalos. This configuration implies a correlation between\npointlike subhalo signals and diffuse background. Based on this semi-analytical\nmodeling, we generate mock gamma-ray data assuming an idealized telescope\nresembling Fermi-LAT and perform a likelihood analysis to estimate the current\nand future sensitivity to subhalos in the relevant parameter space. We find a\nnumber of detectable subhalos of order ${\\cal O}(<1)$ for optimistic model\nparameters and a WIMP mass of 100~GeV, maximized for a cored host halo. This\nbarely provides support to the current interpretation of several Fermi\nunidentified sources as subhalos.

To accommodate a wide\nvariety of products, many automated systems include multiple gripper types\nand/or tool changers. However, for some objects, sequential grasp failures are\ncommon: when a computed grasp fails to lift and remove the object, the bin is\noften left unchanged; as the sensor input is consistent, the system retries the\nsame grasp over and over, resulting in a significant reduction in mean\nsuccessful picks per hour (MPPH). Based on an empirical study of sequential\nfailures, we characterize a class of \"sequential failure objects\" (SFOs) --\nobjects prone to sequential failures based on a novel taxonomy. We then propose\nthree non-Markov picking policies that incorporate memory of past failures to\nmodify subsequent actions. Simulation experiments on SFO models and the EGAD\ndataset suggest that the non-Markov policies significantly outperform the\nMarkov policy in terms of the sequential failure rate and MPPH.

Our approach starts from first principles, the ten\ndifferent classes of linear and anti-linear state transformations in fermionic\nFock spaces, and symmetries defined via invariance properties of the dynamical\nequation for the density matrix. The object of classification are then the\ngenerators of reversible dynamics, dissipation and fluctuations featuring in\nthe generally irreversible and interacting dynamical equations. A sharp\ndistinction between the symmetries of equilibrium and out of equilibrium\ndynamics, respectively, arises from the different role played by `time' in\nthese two cases: In unitary quantum mechanics as well as in `micro-reversible'\nthermal equilibrium, anti-linear transformations combined with an inversion of\ntime define time reversal symmetry. However, out of equilibrium an inversion of\ntime becomes meaningless, while anti--linear transformations in Fock space\nremain physically significant, and hence must be considered in autonomy. The\npractical consequence of this dichotomy is a novel realization of antilinear\nsymmetries (six out of the ten fundamental classes) in non-equilibrium quantum\ndynamics that is fundamentally different from the established rules of thermal\nequilibrium. At large times, the dynamical generators thus symmetry classified\ndetermine the steady state non-equilibrium distributions for arbitrary\ninteracting systems.

We argue that existing models are inadequate in sequential\nsettings when there is incomplete information about a rational adversary and\nyield sub-optimal movement strategies. Further, while there exists an array of\nwork on learning defense policies in sequential settings for cyber-security,\nthey are either unpopular due to scalability issues arising out of incomplete\ninformation or tend to ignore the strategic nature of the adversary simplifying\nthe scenario to use single-agent reinforcement learning techniques.

Umbral chromospheric oscillations exhibit significant\ndifferences compared to their photospheric counterparts. They show an enhanced\npower and a shorter dominant period, from waves with an amplitude of a few\nhundred meters per second in the five-minute band at the photosphere, to\namplitudes of several kilometers per second in the three-minute band at the\nchromosphere. Various models have been proposed to explain this behaviour,\nincluding the presence of a chromospheric resonance cavity between the\nphotosphere and the transition region. Jess et al. (2020, Nature Astronomy, 4,\n220) claimed the detection of observational evidence supporting this model,\nobtained from the comparison of spectropolarimetric observations and numerical\nsimulations. Here, it is shown that the observational insight reported by Jess\net al. is not a common property of sunspots. More importantly, numerical\nmodelling also shows that it is not an unequivocal signature of an acoustic\nresonator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 20:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

Therefore, using the lunar\nchronology for main belt asteroids, as often done in previous publications, is\nincorrect. (ii) The model results match the number and size distribution of\nlarge (diameter $>90$ km) craters observed on Vesta, but overestimate the\nnumber of large craters on Ceres. This implies that large crater erasure is\nrequired for Ceres.

For\nthis purpose, the data-processing program is supposed to be open to the owner,\nso its functionality can be evaluated before trust can be established. However,\nincreasingly there are application scenarios in which the program itself needs\nto be protected. So its compliance with privacy policies as expected by the\ndata owner should be verified without exposing its code.\n  To this end, this paper presents CAT, a new model for TEE-based confidential\nattestation. Our model is inspired by Proof-Carrying Code, where a code\ngenerator produces proof together with the code and a code consumer verifies\nthe proof against the code on its compliance with security policies. Given that\nthe conventional solutions do not work well under the resource-limited and\nTCB-frugal TEE, we propose a new design that allows an untrusted out-enclave\ngenerator to analyze the source code of a program when compiling it into binary\nand a trusted in-enclave consumer efficiently verifies the correctness of the\ninstrumentation and the presence of other protection before running the binary.\nOur design strategically moves most of the workload to the code generator,\nwhich is responsible for producing well-formatted and easy-to-check code, while\nkeeping the consumer simple.

Here we focus on a recently proposed polarizable Gaussian Multipole\n(pGM) model for biomolecular simulations. A key benefit of pGM is its screening\nof all short-range electrostatic interactions in a physically consistent\nmanner, which is critical for stable charge-fitting and is needed to reproduce\nmolecular anisotropy. Another advantage of pGM is that each atom's multipoles\nare represented by a single Gaussian function or its derivatives, allowing for\nmore efficient electrostatics than other Gaussian-based models. In this study\nwe present an efficient formulation for the pGM model defined with respect to a\nlocal frame formed with a set of covalent basis vectors. The covalent basis\nvectors are chosen to be along each atom's covalent bonding directions. The new\nlocal frame allows molecular flexibility during molecular simulations and\nfacilitates an efficient formulation of analytical electrostatic forces without\nexplicit torque computation. Subsequent numerical tests show that analytical\natomic forces agree excellently with numerical finite-difference forces for the\ntested system. Finally, the new pGM electrostatics algorithm is interfaced with\nthe PME implementation in Amber for molecular simulations under the periodic\nboundary conditions. To validate the overall pGM/PME electrostatics, we\nconducted an NVE simulation for a small water box of 512 water molecules.

Conventional data augmentation\nschemes, e.g., flipping, translation or rotation, are low-level,\ndata-independent and class-agnostic operations, leading to limited diversity\nfor augmented samples. To this end, we propose a novel semantic data\naugmentation algorithm to complement traditional approaches. The proposed\nmethod is inspired by the intriguing property that deep networks are effective\nin learning linearized features, i.e., certain directions in the deep feature\nspace correspond to meaningful semantic transformations, e.g., changing the\nbackground or view angle of an object. Based on this observation, translating\ntraining samples along many such directions in the feature space can\neffectively augment the dataset for more diversity. To implement this idea, we\nfirst introduce a sampling based method to obtain semantically meaningful\ndirections efficiently. Then, an upper bound of the expected cross-entropy (CE)\nloss on the augmented training set is derived by assuming the number of\naugmented samples goes to infinity, yielding a highly efficient algorithm. In\nfact, we show that the proposed implicit semantic data augmentation (ISDA)\nalgorithm amounts to minimizing a novel robust CE loss, which adds minimal\nextra computational cost to a normal training procedure. In addition to\nsupervised learning, ISDA can be applied to semi-supervised learning tasks\nunder the consistency regularization framework, where ISDA amounts to\nminimizing the upper bound of the expected KL-divergence between the augmented\nfeatures and the original features. Although being simple, ISDA consistently\nimproves the generalization performance of popular deep models (e.g., ResNets\nand DenseNets) on a variety of datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN,\nImageNet, and Cityscapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 00:32:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 00:31:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2021 07:20:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:30:54 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 09:52:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

In view of the motion-related pulse error\ncharacteristics, the multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) approach is\nexploited to further enhance the performance. Simulations and long-distance\nexperiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the\nproposed methods. It is shown that the standard pulse velocity measurement\nachieves the superior performance, whereas the accumulated pulse measurement is\nmost favorable with the MMAE enhancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 01:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

When an edge $e_t = (u_t, v_t)$ arrives at time step\n$t$, the algorithm must orient the edge either as $v_t \\rightarrow u_t$ or $u_t\n\\rightarrow v_t$, with the objective of minimizing the maximum discrepancy of\nany vertex, i.e., the absolute difference between its in-degree and out-degree.\nEdges correspond to pairs of persons wanting to ride together, and orienting\ndenotes designating the driver. The discrepancy objective then corresponds to\nevery person driving close to their fair share of rides they participate in.\n  In this paper, we design efficient algorithms which can maintain\npolylog$(n,T)$ maximum discrepancy (w.h.p) over any sequence of $T$ arrivals,\nwhen the arriving edges are sampled independently and uniformly from any given\ngraph $G$. This provides the first polylogarithmic bounds for the online\n(stochastic) carpooling problem.

We then combine this with known\nexpander-decomposition results to design our overall algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 01:17:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2020 22:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

Instead, it is sufficient to\ncheck termination (sometimes also called quiescence): an actor is terminated if\nit is not currently processing a message and cannot receive a message in the\nfuture. Moreover, many actor frameworks provide all actors with access to file\nI/O or external storage; without inspecting an actor's internal code, it is\nnecessary to check that the actor has terminated to ensure that it may be\ngarbage collected in these frameworks.

Especially, an estimation of the energy gap between a ground state\nand excited state of a target Hamiltonian corresponding to a molecule is\nessential. In the previous approach, an energy of the ground state and that of\nthe excited state are estimated separately, and the energy gap can be\ncalculated from the subtraction between them. Here, we propose a direct\nestimation of the energy gap between the ground state and excited state of the\ntarget Hamiltonian with quantum annealing. The key idea is to combine a Ramsey\ntype measurement with the quantum annealing. This provides an oscillating\nsignal with a frequency of the energy gap, and a Fourier transform of the\nsignal let us know the energy gap. Based on typical parameters of\nsuperconducting qubits, we numerically investigate the performance of our\nscheme when we estimate an energy gap between the ground state and first\nexcited state of the Hamiltonian. We show robustness against non-adiabatic\ntransitions between the ground state and first-excited state.

UDGs are more centrally concentrated in their\nspatial distribution than other Virgo galaxies of similar luminosity, while\ntheir morphologies demonstrate that at least some UDGs owe their diffuse nature\nto physical processes---such as tidal interactions or low-mass mergers---that\nare at play within the cluster environment. The globular cluster (GC) systems\nof Virgo UDGs have a wide range in specific frequency ($S_N$), with a higher\nmean $S_N$ than \"normal\" Virgo dwarfs, but a lower mean $S_N$ than Coma UDGs at\nfixed luminosity.

In contrast to the cloud server, the computing capacity\nof fog nodes is limited and thus a single fog node might not be capable of\ncomputing-intensive tasks. In this context, task offloading can be particularly\nuseful at the fog nodes by selecting the suitable nodes and proper resource\nmanagement while guaranteeing the Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of the\nusers.

For example, to study the evolution of the economic\nstatus of a country, economists monitor changes in the quantiles of annual\nhousehold incomes, based on multiple survey datasets collected annually. Even\nwith multiple samples, a routine approach would estimate the quantiles of\ndifferent populations separately.

These models, however, are both monolithic and static in the sense that\nthey typically use a specific level of features, e.g., the output of the last\nlayer, and adhere to it regardless of the images to match. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel approach to visual correspondence that dynamically composes\neffective features by leveraging relevant layers conditioned on the images to\nmatch. Inspired by both multi-layer feature composition in object detection and\nadaptive inference architectures in classification, the proposed method, dubbed\nDynamic Hyperpixel Flow, learns to compose hypercolumn features on the fly by\nselecting a small number of relevant layers from a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork. We demonstrate the effectiveness on the task of semantic\ncorrespondence, i.e., establishing correspondences between images depicting\ndifferent instances of the same object or scene category. Experiments on\nstandard benchmarks show that the proposed method greatly improves matching\nperformance over the state of the art in an adaptive and efficient manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 04:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

Most\nconventional scenarios assume that the far-field planar wavefronts hold. In\nthis paper, we investigate the DoA estimation problem in short-range MIMO\ncommunications, where the effect of near-field spherical wave is\nnon-negligible. By converting it into a regression task, a novel DoA estimation\nframework based on complex-valued deep learning (CVDL) is proposed for the\nnear-field region in short-range MIMO communication systems. Under the\nassumption of a spherical wave model, the array steering vector is determined\nby both the distance and the direction. However, solving this regression task\ncontaining a massive number of variables is challenging, since datasets need to\ncapture numerous complicated feature representations. To overcome this, a\nvirtual covariance matrix (VCM) based on received signals is constructed, and\nthus such features extracted from the VCM can deal with the complicated\ncoupling relationship between the direction and the distance. Although the\nemergence of wireless big data driven by future communication networks promotes\ndeep learning-based wireless signal processing, the learning algorithms of\ncomplex-valued signals are still ongoing. This paper proposes a one-dimensional\n(1-D) residual network that can directly tackle complex-valued features due to\nthe inherent 1-D structure of signal subspace vectors. In addition, we put\nforth a cropped VCM based policy which can be applied to different antenna\nsizes. The proposed method is able to fully exploit the complex-valued\ninformation.

We found that membrane deformation changes stable patterns\nrelative to those that occur on a non-deformable curved surface, as determined\nby linear stability analysis. We further found that budding and multi-spindle\nshapes are induced by Turing patterns, and we also observed the transition from\noscillation patterns to stable spot patterns.

When it comes to medical infrastructure, it becomes very\nimperative for medical devices to communicate with the base station. In such\nsituations, communication over the wireless medium must provide optimized\nthroughput (data rate) with effectual energy usage, which will ensure precise\nmedical feedback by the responsible staff. Taking into account, it is necessary\nto operate wireless communication precisely at a higher frequency with more\nsubstantial bandwidth and low latency. Cognitive Radio (CR) is traditionally a\nviable choice, where it identifies and utilizes the vacant spectrum, thus\nmaximizing the primary user's capacity and achieving spectral efficiency. To\nensure such outcomes, the Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) techniques have\nproven to deliver an effective solution to the increasing number of devices\nwith unimpaired performance, especially when the communication shifts towards a\nhigher frequency band such as the mmWave band. In this chapter, IoT based CR\nnetwork in uplink communication is proposed alongside employing NOMA techniques\nfor optimal throughput, and energy efficiency for a medical infrastructure.\nNumerical results show that effectual throughput and energy efficiency for a\nHigh Reliable Communication (HRC) device and Moderate Reliable Communication\n(MRC) device improve over 83.13% and 73.95%, respectively and their\ncorresponding energy efficacy values show vast improvement (83.11% and 73.96%\nrespectively).

Lack of sufficient amount\nof labeled observations for the training of IDSs makes the semi-supervised IDSs\na preferred choice. We propose a semi-supervised IDS by extending a data\nanalysis technique known as Logical Analysis of Data, or LAD in short, which\nwas proposed as a supervised learning approach. LAD uses partially defined\nBoolean functions (pdBf) and their extensions to find the positive and the\nnegative patterns from the past observations for classification of future\nobservations. We extend the LAD to make it semi-supervised to design an IDS.\nThe proposed SSIDS consists of two phases: offline and online. The offline\nphase builds the classifier by identifying the behavior patterns of normal and\nabnormal network usage. Later, these patterns are transformed into rules for\nclassification and the rules are used during the online phase for the detection\nof abnormal network behaviors. The performance of the proposed SSIDS is far\nbetter than the existing semi-supervised IDSs and comparable with the\nsupervised IDSs as evident from the experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 05:32:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

While current\nmodel interpretation methodologies focus on using locally linear functions to\napproximate the models or creating self-explanatory models that give\nexplanations to each input instance, they do not focus on model interpretation\nat the subpopulation level, which is the understanding of model interpretations\nacross different subset aggregations in a dataset. To address the challenges of\nproviding explanations of an ML model across the whole dataset, we propose\nSUBPLEX, a visual analytics system to help users understand black-box model\nexplanations with subpopulation visual analysis. SUBPLEX is designed through an\niterative design process with machine learning researchers to address three\nusage scenarios of real-life machine learning tasks: model debugging, feature\nselection, and bias detection.

However, existing methods\ntend to yield overly general captions and consist of some of the most frequent\nwords/phrases, resulting in inaccurate and indistinguishable descriptions (see\nFigure 1). This is primarily due to (i) the conservative characteristic of\ntraditional training objectives that drives the model to generate correct but\nhardly discriminative captions for similar images and (ii) the uneven word\ndistribution of the ground-truth captions, which encourages generating highly\nfrequent words/phrases while suppressing the less frequent but more concrete\nones. In this work, we propose a novel global-local discriminative objective\nthat is formulated on top of a reference model to facilitate generating\nfine-grained descriptive captions. Specifically, from a global perspective, we\ndesign a novel global discriminative constraint that pulls the generated\nsentence to better discern the corresponding image from all others in the\nentire dataset.

We used a novel application of Optimal Transport for computing\nthe distance between the normalized patterns induced by bivariate time series\nfor each pair of cities.

Despite the long history of distortion\nrectification, accurately estimating the distortion parameters from a single\ndistorted image is still challenging. The main reason is these parameters are\nimplicit to image features, influencing the networks to fully learn the\ndistortion information. In this work, we propose a novel distortion\nrectification approach that can obtain more accurate parameters with higher\nefficiency. Our key insight is that distortion rectification can be cast as a\nproblem of learning an ordinal distortion from a single distorted image. To\nsolve this problem, we design a local-global associated estimation network that\nlearns the ordinal distortion to approximate the realistic distortion\ndistribution. In contrast to the implicit distortion parameters, the proposed\nordinal distortion have more explicit relationship with image features, and\nthus significantly boosts the distortion perception of neural networks.\nConsidering the redundancy of distortion information, our approach only uses a\npart of distorted image for the ordinal distortion estimation, showing\npromising applications in the efficient distortion rectification. To our\nknowledge, we first unify the heterogeneous distortion parameters into a\nlearning-friendly intermediate representation through ordinal distortion,\nbridging the gap between image feature and distortion rectification.

Bodily\nmovement is universally associated with music and reflective of important\nindividual features related to music preference such as personality, mood, and\nempathy. Future multimodal MIR systems may benefit from taking these aspects\ninto account. The current study addresses this by identifying individual\ndifferences, specifically Big Five personality traits, and scores on the\nEmpathy and Systemizing Quotients (EQ/SQ) from participants' free dance\nmovements. Our model successfully explored the unseen space for personality as\nwell as EQ, SQ, which has not previously been accomplished for the latter.

Nevertheless, deprivation indices provide an essential tool for\nmitigating the effects of deprivation and reducing it through policy\ninterventions. Here we demonstrate the construction of a deprivation index\nusing diffusion maps, a manifold learning technique capable of finding the\nvariables that optimally describe the variations in a dataset in the sense of\npreserving pairwise relationships among the data points. The method is applied\nto the 2010 US decennial census. In contrast to other methods the proposed\nprocedure does not select particular columns from the census, but rather\nconstructs an indicator of deprivation from the complete dataset. Due to its\nconstruction the proposed index does not introduce biases except those already\npresent in the source data, does not require normative judgment regarding the\ndesirability of certain life styles, and is highly resilient against attempts\nof partisan manipulation. We demonstrate that the new index aligns well with\nestablished income-based deprivation indices but deviates in aspects that are\nperceived as problematic in some of the existing indices. The proposed\nprocedure provides an efficient way for constructing accurate, high resolution\nindices. These indices can thus have the potential to become powerful tools for\nthe academic study of social structure as well as political decision making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 11:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

We find that\nCrSBr monolayers are ferromagnetically ordered below 146 K, an observation\nenabled by the discovery of a giant magnetic dipole SHG effect in the\ncentrosymmetric 2D structure.

I then ask\n`what would it take to make SH0ES compatible with early time measurements?'.\nThe answer is a systematic bias of 0.1 - 0.15 mag in the intercept of the\nCepheid period-luminosity relations of SH0ES galaxies. Such a bias resolves the\nHubble tension, the tension between the distance anchors, and the difference\nbetween SH0ES and the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distance ladder, as\nmeasured and calibrated by Freedman and collaborators.

Several of the other\nclasses have been described as the automorphism groups of geometric or\ncombinatorial structures such as affine spaces or Cartesian decompositions, but\nsuch structures for diagonal groups have not been studied.\n  The main purpose of this paper is to describe and characterise such\nstructures, which we call diagonal semilattices. Unlike the diagonal groups in\nthe O'Nan-Scott theorem, which are defined over finite characteristically\nsimple groups, our construction works over any group, finite or infinite.\n  A diagonal semilattice depends on a dimension m and a group T. For m=2, it is\na Latin square, the Cayley table of T, though in fact any Latin square\nsatisfies our axioms. However, for m>=3, the group T emerges naturally and\nuniquely from the axioms.

Many of the concepts and\nconstructions come from experimental design in statistics.\n  We also determine when a diagonal group can be primitive, or quasiprimitive\n(these conditions are equivalent for diagonal groups).\n  Associated with the diagonal semilattice is a graph, the diagonal graph,\nwhich has the same automorphism group except in four small cases with m<=3.

Theoretical explanations have focused on the\nidea of electrons transferring from the extended s-orbital to the compact\nf-orbital. However, experimental measurement has been unable to detect any\nassociated change in the magnetic properties of the f-electrons. Here we\nresolve this discrepancy by showing that there is no significant volume\ncollapse, beyond what is typical in high pressure phase transformations. We\npresent density functional theory calculations of solid gadolinium under high\npressure using a range of methods, and revisit the experimental situation using\nX-ray diffraction (XRD). The standard lanthanide pressure-transformation\nsequence involving different stackings of close-packed planes: hcp to 9R to\ndhcp to fcc to d-fcc is reproduced. The so-called \"volume collapsed\"\nhigh-pressure phase is shown to be an unusual stacking of close-packed planes,\nwith Fddd symmetry and a density change less than 2%. The distorted fcc (d-fcc)\nstructure is revealed to arise as a consequence of antiferromagnetism. The\ntheoretical results are shown to be remarkably robust to various treatments of\nthe f-electrons. The key result is that there is no XRD evidence for volume\ncollapse in Gadolinium. The sequence of phase transitions is well described by\nstandard DFT.

The hierarchy is modeled by a\nseries of interlinked principal-agent problems, leading to a sequence of\nStackelberg equilibria. More precisely, the principal can contract with the\nmanagers to incentivise them to act in her best interest, despite only\nobserving the net benefits of the total hierarchy. Managers in turn subcontract\nwith the agents below them. Both agents and managers independently control in\ncontinuous time a stochastic process representing their outcome. First, we show\nthrough a continuous-time adaptation of Sung's model that, even if the agents\nonly control the drift of their outcome, their manager controls the volatility\nof their continuation utility. This first simple example justifies the use of\nrecent results on optimal contracting for drift and volatility control, and\ntherefore the theory of second-order backward stochastic differential\nequations, developed in the theoretical part of this paper, dedicated to a more\ngeneral model. The comprehensive approach we outline highlights the benefits of\nconsidering a continuous-time model and opens the way to obtain comparative\nstatics. We also explain how the model can be extended to a large-scale\nprincipal-agent hierarchy. Since the principal's problem can be reduced to only\nan $m$-dimensional state space and a $2m$-dimensional control set, where $m$ is\nthe number of managers immediately below her, and is therefore independent of\nthe size of the hierarchy below these managers, the dimension of the problem\ndoes not explode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 12:47:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains\nelusive. Herein we perform multiple microsecond molecular dynamics simulations\non both wildtype (WT) and V127 variant of human PrPC to understand at atomic\nlevel the protective effect of V127 variant. Our simulations show that G127V\nmutation not only increases the rigidity of the S2-H2 loop between strand-2\n(S2) and helix-2 (H2), but also allosterically enhances the stability of the H2\nC-terminal region. Interestingly, previous studies reported that animals with\nrigid S2-H2 loop usually do not develop prion diseases, and the increase in H2\nC-terminal stability can prevent misfolding and oligomerization of prion\nprotein. The allosteric paths from G/V127 to H2 C-terminal region are\nidentified using dynamical network analyses. Moreover, community network\nanalyses illustrate that G127V mutation enhances the global correlations and\nintra-molecular interactions of PrP, thus stabilizing the overall PrPC\nstructure and inhibiting its conversion into PrPSc.

However, CSI errors are inevitable in practice and generally\ncorrelated over the IRS reflecting elements due to the limited training with\ndiscrete phase shifts, which degrade the data transmission rate and\nreliability. In this paper, we focus on investigating the effect of CSI errors\nto the outage performance in an IRS-aided multiuser downlink communication\nsystem. Specifically, we aim to jointly optimize the active transmit precoding\nvectors at the access point (AP) and passive discrete phase shifts at the IRS\nto minimize the AP's transmit power, subject to the constraints on the maximum\nCSI-error induced outage probability for the users. First, we consider the\nsingle-user case and derive the user's outage probability in terms of the mean\nsignal power (MSP) and variance of the received signal at the user. Since there\nis a trade-off in tuning these two parameters to minimize the outage\nprobability, we propose to maximize their weighted sum with the optimal weight\nfound by one-dimensional search. Then, for the general multiuser case, since\nthe users' outage probabilities are difficult to obtain in closed-form due to\nthe inter-user interference, we propose a novel constrained stochastic\nsuccessive convex approximation (CSSCA) algorithm, which replaces the\nnon-convex outage probability constraints with properly designed convex\nsurrogate approximations.

However, a critical challenge for meta-learning\nis the representation deficiency since it is hard to discover common\ninformation from a small number of training samples or even one, as is the\nrepresentation of key features from such little information. As a result, a\nmeta-learner cannot be trained well in a high-dimensional parameter space to\ngeneralize to new tasks.

Computing homogenized\ncoefficients requires solving local corrector problems followed by upscaling\nrelevant local data. The most naive way of computing homogenized coefficients\nis by solving a local elliptic problem, which is known to suffer from the\nso-called resonance error dominating all other errors inherent in multiscale\ncomputations. A far more efficient modelling strategy, based on adding an\nexponential correction term to the standard local elliptic problem, has\nrecently been proved to result in exponentially decaying error bounds with\nrespect to the size of the local geometry.

However, in the general case, the usual exponential\nfactor (in the particle number) defining the grand-canonical chemical\npotential, is replaced by the exponential of a non-linear function of the\ndensity, this function being proportional to the volume. This case is\nillustrated explicitly on a one-dimensional lattice model. Although a\ngrand-canonical chemical potential can no longer be defined in this case, it is\npossible for a subclass of contact dynamics to generalize the equilibrium\nfluctuation-response relation by introducing a small external potential\ndifference between the system and the reservoir.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 14:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

Although, when the compact object (e.g., a WD or\nan NS) has a finite surface, its rapid rotation, the stellar magnetic field\ncould cause deformation of the spherical symmetry. Earlier studies for\nKeplerian disc showed that a deviation from the spherical symmetry of the\ncompact object could affect the observed light curve and spectra at high\nfrequencies. Here, we have explored the effect of the non-spherical nature of a\ncompact object on the hydrodynamics of an optically thin, geometrically thick\nsub-Keplerian advective flow.

The latter are ensembles of unitaries that (approximately) recover Haar\naverages of polynomials in entries of unitary channels up to order $t$.\n  In this work we establish quantitative connections between these two notions.\nSpecifically, we prove that, for a fixed dimension $d$ of the Hilbert space,\nunitaries constituting $\\delta$-approximate $t$-expanders form $\\epsilon$-nets\nfor $t\\simeq\\frac{d^{5/2}}{\\epsilon}$ and\n$\\delta=\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon^{3/2}}{d}\\right)^{d^2}$.

Scarcely any of the papers mentioned uncertainty in the\nratio of the mean execution times, and most did not even mention uncertainty in\nthe two means themselves. Most of the papers failed to address the\nnon-deterministic execution of computer programs (caused by factors such as\nmemory placement, for example), and none addressed non-deterministic\ncompilation.

These\nswitchbacks are extensively found in the near-Sun solar wind, appear to occur\nin patches, and have possible links to various phenomena such as magnetic\nreconnection near the solar surface. As switchbacks are associated with faster\nplasma flows, we questioned whether they are hotter than the background plasma\nand whether the microphysics inside a switchback is different to its\nsurroundings. We have studied the reduced distribution functions from the Solar\nProbe Cup instrument and considered time periods with markedly large angular\ndeflections, to compare parallel temperatures inside and outside switchbacks.\nWe have shown that the reduced distribution functions inside switchbacks are\nconsistent with a rigid phase space rotation of the background plasma. As such,\nwe conclude that the proton core parallel temperature is the same inside and\noutside of switchbacks, implying that a T-V relationship does not hold for the\nproton core parallel temperature inside magnetic field switchbacks. We further\nconclude that switchbacks are consistent with Alfv\\'enic pulses travelling\nalong open magnetic field lines. The origin of these pulses, however, remains\nunknown. We also found that there is no obvious link between radial Poynting\nflux and kinetic energy enhancements suggesting that the radial Poynting flux\nis not important for the dynamics of switchbacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 15:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

The\nclassical linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) model is derived based on\nthe assumption of small strain values. However, since the strain values in the\nmodel are linearly proportional to the stress values, the strain value can be\nlarge if the stress value increases. Thus this results in the contradiction of\nthe assumption to LEFM and it is one of the major disadvantages of the model.\nIn particular, this singular behavior of the strain values is often observed\nespecially near the crack-tip, and it may not accurately predict realistic\nphenomena. Thus, we investigate the framework of a new class of theoretical\nmodel, which is known as the nonlinear strain-limiting model. The advantage of\nthe nonlinear strain-limiting models over LEFM is that the strain value remains\nbounded even if the stress value tends to the infinity. This is achieved by\nassuming the nonlinear relation between the strain and stress in the derivation\nof the model. Moreover, we consider the quasi-static fracture propagation by\ncoupling with the phase-field approach to present the effectiveness of the\nproposed strain-limiting model. Several numerical examples to evaluate and\nvalidate the performance of the new model and algorithms are presented.\nDetailed comparisons of the strain values, fracture energy, and fracture\npropagation speed between nonlinear strain-limiting model and LEFM for the\nquasi-static fracture propagation are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 16:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-23"}

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a real-time,\nhybrid neuromorphic framework for object tracking and classification using\nevent-based cameras that possess properties such as low-power consumption (5-14\nmW) and high dynamic range (120 dB). Nonetheless, unlike traditional approaches\nof using event-by-event processing, this work uses a mixed frame and event\napproach to get energy savings with high performance. Using a frame-based\nregion proposal method based on the density of foreground events, a\nhardware-friendly object tracking scheme is implemented using the apparent\nobject velocity while tackling occlusion scenarios. The object track input is\nconverted back to spikes for TrueNorth classification via the energy-efficient\ndeep network (EEDN) pipeline.

Various approaches have been proposed to\nreduce the high computation and memory cost when training and predicting based\non large-scale datasets with kernel SVMs. A popular one is the linearization\nframework, which successfully builds a bridge between the $L_1$-loss kernel SVM\nand the $L_1$-loss linear SVM. For linear SVMs, very recently, a semismooth\nNewton's method is proposed. It is shown to be very competitive and have low\ncomputational cost. Consequently, a natural question is whether it is possible\nto develop a fast semismooth Newton's algorithm for kernel SVMs. Motivated by\nthis question and the idea in linearization framework, in this paper, we focus\non the $L_2$-loss kernel SVM and propose a semismooth Newton's method based\nlinearization and approximation approach for it. The main idea of this approach\nis to first set up an equivalent linear SVM, then apply the Nystr\\\"om method to\napproximate the kernel matrix, based on which a reduced linear SVM is obtained.\nFinally, the fast semismooth Newton's method is employed to solve the reduced\nlinear SVM. We also provide some theoretical analyses on the approximation of\nthe kernel matrix. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it maintains\nlow computational cost and keeps a fast convergence rate. Results of extensive\nnumerical experiments verify the efficiency of the proposed approach in terms\nof both predicting accuracy and speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 07:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-24"}

Apart from a few exceptions, previous poroelastic DC models\nhave assumed isotropy of the constituents and the dual-material. Additionally,\nit is common to assume that only one continuum has intrinsic stiffness\nproperties. Finally, little has been done into validating whether the DC\nparadigm can capture the global poroelastic behaviours of explicit numerical\nrepresentations at the DC modelling scale. We address the aforementioned\nknowledge gaps in two steps. First, we utilise a homogenisation approach based\non Levin's theorem to develop a previously derived anisotropic poroelastic\nconstitutive model. Our development incorporates anisotropic intrinsic\nstiffness properties of both continua. This addition is in analogy to\nanisotropic fractured rock masses with stiff fractures. Second, we perform\nnumerical modelling to test the dual-continuum model against fine-scale\nexplicit equivalents. In doing, we present our hybrid numerical framework, as\nwell as the conditions required for interpretation of the numerical results.\nThe tests themselves progress from materials with isotropic to anisotropic\nmechanical and flow properties.

In\npractice, grating lobes appear if the pixel size is not sub-wavelength, which\nis an issue for many optical technologies. Furthermore, the phase performance\nof an optical pixel may not span the required $2\\pi$ phase range, or may not\nproduce a constant amplitude over its phase range.

It plays a significant role in\nbig data applications and consists in searching and finding data from different\ntypes of media. In this paper, we provide a novel taxonomy according to the\nchallenges faced by multi-modal deep learning approaches in solving cross-media\nretrieval, namely: representation, alignment, and translation. These challenges\nare evaluated on deep learning (DL) based methods, which are categorized into\nfour main groups: 1) unsupervised methods, 2) supervised methods, 3) pairwise\nbased methods, and 4) rank based methods. Then, we present some well-known\ncross-media datasets used for retrieval, considering the importance of these\ndatasets in the context in of deep learning based cross-media retrieval\napproaches. Moreover, we also present an extensive review of the\nstate-of-the-art problems and its corresponding solutions for encouraging deep\nlearning in cross-media retrieval. The fundamental objective of this work is to\nexploit Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for bridging the \"media gap\", and provide\nresearchers and developers with a better understanding of the underlying\nproblems and the potential solutions of deep learning assisted cross-media\nretrieval. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey\nto address cross-media retrieval under deep learning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 09:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

Such a model based on the model of Zender\n\\cite{Zender} is proposed in this article. It includes different methods of\nthreshold wind friction estimation and takes into account the influence of\natmospheric electric fields on sand and dust elevation processes. The model\nparameterized for the Earth was tested on data acquired in Morocco field\ncampaign 2013-2014 (Esposito et al.,) \\cite{Esposito}, \\cite{Esposito2}. Wind\nfriction, wind friction threshold, horizontal sand flux and vertical dust flux\nwere simulated by using the following inputs measured in the field: wind speed,\nwind direction, air temperature, air pressure, air humidity, solar irradiation\nand surface roughness length. The same inputs are supposed to be measured by\nDREAMs equipment on Mars (except for the surface roughness length which can be\nestimated for Mars according the method of Hebrard \\cite{Hebrard}). Simulated\nand experimental values have shown a good agreement. The model was adapted to\nMartian conditions and applied to the data of Viking lander. The local wind\nerosion and dust deposition model parameterized for Mars may serve 1) to\nanalyze local lander/rovers data, 2) a source of local parameters/inputs (like\nthreshold wind friction velocity, sand and dust fluxes) for the MGCM (Mars\nGlobal Circulation Model).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 12:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-06"}

Such\ntechnological developments from AI-labs have ushered concomitant applications\nacross the world of business - where an AI brand tag is fast becoming\nubiquitous. A corollary of such widespread commercial deployment is that when\nAI gets things wrong - an autonomous vehicle crashes; a chatbot exhibits racist\nbehaviour; automated credit scoring processes discriminate on gender etc. -\nthere are often significant financial, legal and brand consequences and the\nincident becomes major news. As Judea Pearl sees it, the underlying reason for\nsuch mistakes is that, 'all the impressive achievements of deep learning amount\nto just curve fitting'. The key, Judea Pearl suggests, is to replace reasoning\nby association with causal-reasoning - the ability to infer causes from\nobserved phenomena. It is a point that was echoed by Gary Marcus and Ernest\nDavis in a recent piece for the New York Times: 'we need to stop building\ncomputer systems that merely get better and better at detecting statistical\npatterns in data sets - often using an approach known as Deep Learning - and\nstart building computer systems that from the moment of their assembly innately\ngrasp three basic concepts: time, space and causality'. In this paper,\nforegrounding what in 1949 Gilbert Ryle termed a category mistake, I will offer\nan alternative explanation for AI errors: it is not so much that AI machinery\ncannot grasp causality, but that AI machinery - qua computation - cannot\nunderstand anything at all.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 22:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

For image\ndata related matrix recovery problems, approximate low-rankness and smoothness\nare the two most commonly imposed structures. For approximately low-rank matrix\nrecovery, the robust principal component analysis (PCA) is well-studied and\nproved to be effective. For smooth matrix problem, 2d fused Lasso and other\ntotal variation based approaches have played a fundamental role. Although both\nlow-rankness and smoothness are key assumptions for image data analysis, the\ntwo lines of research, however, have very limited interaction. Motivated by\ntaking advantage of both features, we in this paper develop a framework named\nprojected robust PCA (PRPCA), under which the low-rank matrices are projected\nonto a space of smooth matrices. Consequently, a large class of image matrices\ncan be decomposed as a low-rank and smooth component plus a sparse component. A\nkey advantage of this decomposition is that the dimension of the core low-rank\ncomponent can be significantly reduced. Consequently, our framework is able to\naddress a problematic bottleneck of many low-rank matrix problems: singular\nvalue decomposition (SVD) on large matrices. Theoretically, we provide explicit\nstatistical recovery guarantees of PRPCA and include classical robust PCA as a\nspecial case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 11:23:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 12:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-08"}
