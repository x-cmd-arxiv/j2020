Unfortunately, progress in the development of such platforms has\nbeen hindered by the fact that mobile ions present in biological samples screen\ncharges from the target molecule, greatly reducing sensor sensitivity. Under\nphysiological conditions, the thickness of the resulting electric double layer\nis less than 1 nm, and it has generally been assumed that electronic detection\nbeyond this distance is virtually impossible. However, a few recently-described\nsensor design strategies seem to defy this conventional wisdom, exploiting the\nphysics of electrical double layers in ways that traditional models do not\ncapture. In the first strategy, charge screening is decreased by constraining\nthe space in which double layers can form. The second strategy uses external\nstimuli to prevent double layers from reaching equilibrium, thereby effectively\nreducing charge screening. The goal of this article is to describe these\nrelatively new concepts, and to offer theoretical insights into mechanisms that\nmay enable electronic biosensing beyond the double-layer.

A general\nmeta-planning strategy is to learn to impose constraints on the states\nconsidered and actions taken by the agent.

Accurate similarity estimation between\nprograms requires an in-depth understanding of their structure, semantics and\nflow. A control flow graph (CFG), is a graphical representation of a program\nwhich captures its logical control flow and hence its semantics. A common\napproach is to estimate program similarity by analysing CFGs using graph\nsimilarity measures, e.g. graph edit distance (GED). However, graph edit\ndistance is an NP-hard problem and computationally expensive, making the\napplication of graph similarity techniques to complex software programs\nimpractical. This study intends to examine the effectiveness of graph neural\nnetworks to estimate program similarity, by analysing the associated control\nflow graphs.

We illustrate the capabilities in case of a) one or more\nclasses do not have any annotation; b) there is no annotation at all; c) there\nare bounding boxes.

The design variable is taken as an infinite-dimensional\nspatially-varying field that represents the material property, while an\nadditive infinite-dimensional random field represents the variability of the\nmaterial property or the manufacturing error. Discretization of this optimal\ndesign problem results in high-dimensional design variables and uncertain\nparameters. To solve this problem, we develop a computational approach based on\na Taylor approximation and an approximate Newton method for optimization, which\nis based on a Hessian derived at the mean of the random field. We show our\napproach is scalable with respect to the dimension of both the design variables\nand uncertain parameters, in the sense that the necessary number of acoustic\nwave propagations is essentially independent of these dimensions, for numerical\nexperiments with up to one million design variables and half a million\nuncertain parameters. We demonstrate that, using our computational approach, an\noptimal design of the acoustic cloak that is robust to material uncertainty is\nachieved in a tractable manner. The optimal design under uncertainty problem is\nposed and solved for the classical circular obstacle surrounded by a\nring-shaped cloaking region, subjected to both a single-direction\nsingle-frequency incident wave and multiple-direction multiple-frequency\nincident waves. Finally, we apply the method to a deterministic large-scale\noptimal cloaking problem with complex geometry, to demonstrate that the\napproximate Newton method's Hessian computation is viable for large, complex\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 00:17:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Many efforts\nhave been made to address the mismatch between the distributions of training\nand testing data, but unfortunately, they ignore the task-oriented information\nacross domains and are inflexible to perform well in complicated open-set\nscenarios. Many efforts have been made to eliminate the mismatch between the\ndistributions of training and testing data by learning domain-invariant\nrepresentations. However, the learned representations are usually not\ntask-oriented, i.e., being class-discriminative and domain-transferable\nsimultaneously. This drawback limits the flexibility of UDA in complicated\nopen-set tasks where no labels are shared between domains. In this paper, we\nbreak the concept of task-orientation into task-relevance and task-irrelevance,\nand propose a dynamic task-oriented disentangling network (DTDN) to learn\ndisentangled representations in an end-to-end fashion for UDA. The dynamic\ndisentangling network effectively disentangles data representations into two\ncomponents: the task-relevant ones embedding critical information associated\nwith the task across domains, and the task-irrelevant ones with the remaining\nnon-transferable or disturbing information. These two components are\nregularized by a group of task-specific objective functions across domains.\nSuch regularization explicitly encourages disentangling and avoids the use of\ngenerative models or decoders.

In this paper, we consider a CPS that has to satisfy a\nlinear temporal logic (LTL) objective in the presence of two kinds of\nadversaries. The first adversary has the ability to tamper with inputs to the\nCPS to influence satisfaction of the LTL objective. The interaction of the CPS\nwith this adversary is modeled as a stochastic game. We synthesize a controller\nfor the CPS to maximize the probability of satisfying the LTL objective under\nany policy of this adversary. The second adversary is an eavesdropper who can\nobserve labeled trajectories of the CPS generated from the previous step. It\ncould then use this information to launch other kinds of attacks. A labeled\ntrajectory is a sequence of labels, where a label is associated to a state and\nis linked to the satisfaction of the LTL objective at that state. We use\ndifferential privacy to quantify the indistinguishability between states that\nare related to each other when the eavesdropper sees a labeled trajectory. Two\ntrajectories of equal length will be differentially private if they are\ndifferentially private at each state along the respective trajectories.

Compared to the conventional terrestrial\nIRS, AIRS enjoys more deployment flexibility as well as wider-range signal\nreflection, thanks to its high altitude and thus more likelihood of\nestablishing line-of-sight (LoS) links with ground source/destination nodes.\nSpecifically, we aim to maximize the worst-case signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nover all locations in a target area by jointly optimizing the transmit\nbeamforming for the source node and the placement as well as 3D passive\nbeamforming for the AIRS. The formulated problem is non-convex and thus\ndifficult to solve. To gain useful insights, we first consider the special case\nof maximizing the SNR at a given target location, for which the optimal\nsolution is obtained in closed-form. The result shows that the optimal\nhorizontal AIRS placement only depends on the ratio between the\nsource-destination distance and the AIRS altitude. Then for the general case of\nAIRS-enabled area coverage, we propose an efficient solution by decoupling the\nAIRS passive beamforming design to maximize the worst-case array gain, from its\nplacement optimization by balancing the resulting angular span and the cascaded\nchannel path loss. Our proposed solution is based on a novel 3D beam broadening\nand flattening technique, where the passive array of the AIRS is divided into\nsub-arrays of appropriate size, and their phase shifts are designed to form a\nflattened beam pattern with adjustable beamwidth catering to the size of the\ncoverage area. Both the uniform linear array (ULA)-based and uniform planar\narray (UPA)-based AIRSs are considered in our design, which enable\ntwo-dimensional (2D) and 3D passive beamforming, respectively.

Moreover, organizations are loathed\nto share emails, given the risk of leakage of commercially sensitive\ninformation. So, it is uncommon to obtain sufficient emails to train a global\nAI model efficiently. Accordingly, privacy-preserving distributed and\ncollaborative machine learning, particularly Federated Learning (FL), is a\ndesideratum. Already prevalent in the healthcare sector, questions remain\nregarding the effectiveness and efficacy of FL-based phishing detection within\nthe context of multi-organization collaborations. To the best of our knowledge,\nthe work herein is the first to investigate the use of FL in email\nanti-phishing. This paper builds upon a deep neural network model, particularly\nRNN and BERT for phishing email detection. It analyzes the FL-entangled\nlearning performance under various settings, including balanced and\nasymmetrical data distribution. Our results corroborate comparable performance\nstatistics of FL in phishing email detection to centralized learning for\nbalanced datasets, and low organization counts. Moreover, we observe a\nvariation in performance when increasing organizational counts. For a fixed\ntotal email dataset, the global RNN based model suffers by a 1.8% accuracy drop\nwhen increasing organizational counts from 2 to 10. In contrast, BERT accuracy\nrises by 0.6% when going from 2 to 5 organizations. However, if we allow\nincreasing the overall email dataset with the introduction of new organizations\nin the FL framework, the organizational level performance is improved by\nachieving a faster convergence speed. Besides, FL suffers in its overall global\nmodel performance due to highly unstable outputs if the email dataset\ndistribution is highly asymmetric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 03:58:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 01:22:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 06:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

One family of solutions is to learn synthesised unseen visual\nsamples produced by generative models from auxiliary semantic information, such\nas natural language descriptions. However, for most of these models,\nperformance suffers from noise in the form of irrelevant image backgrounds.\nFurther, most methods do not allocate a calculated weight to each semantic\npatch. Yet, in the real world, the discriminative power of features can be\nquantified and directly leveraged to improve accuracy and reduce computational\ncomplexity. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called\nmulti-patch generative adversarial nets (MPGAN) that synthesises local patch\nfeatures and labels unseen classes with a novel weighted voting strategy. The\nprocess begins by generating discriminative visual features from noisy text\ndescriptions for a set of predefined local patches using multiple specialist\ngenerative models. The features synthesised from each patch for unseen classes\nare then used to construct an ensemble of diverse supervised classifiers, each\ncorresponding to one local patch. A voting strategy averages the probability\ndistributions output from the classifiers and, given that some patches are more\ndiscriminative than others, a discrimination-based attention mechanism helps to\nweight each patch accordingly. Extensive experiments show that MPGAN has\nsignificantly greater accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 05:49:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 03:50:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 01:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

Detailed flow predictions\ndemonstrate that the recurrent R-U-Net surrogate model provides accurate\nresults for dynamic states and well responses for new geological realizations,\nalong with accurate flow statistics for an ensemble of new geomodels. The 3D\nrecurrent R-U-Net and CNN-PCA procedures are then used in combination for a\nchallenging data assimilation problem involving a channelized system. Two\ndifferent algorithms, namely rejection sampling and an ensemble-based method,\nare successfully applied. The overall methodology described in this paper may\nenable the assessment and refinement of data assimilation procedures for a\nrange of realistic and challenging subsurface flow problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 07:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

In\nthis paper, our goal is to explore the concept of these standing waves being\nself-sustained oscillations, driven by a constant background flow. To that end,\nwe use the PLUTO code, to perform $3$D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a\ngravitationally stratified straight flux tube in a coronal environment, in the\npresence of a weak flow around the loop, perpendicular to its axis. Once this\nflow is firmly set up, a transverse oscillation is initiated, dominated by the\nfundamental kink mode of a standing wave, while the existence of a second\nharmonic is revealed, with a frequency ratio to the fundamental mode near the\nobserved ones in decay-less oscillations. The presence of vortex shedding is\nalso established in our simulations, which is connected to the \"slippery\"\ninteraction between the oscillator and its surrounding plasma.

We find for the first time a bright and clear streamer in\nchemically fresh material (Carbon-chain species) that originates from outside\nthe dense core (>10,500 au). This material connects the outer dense core with\nthe region where asymmetries arise near disk scales. This new structure type,\n10x larger than those seen near disk scales, suggests a different\ninterpretation of previous observations: large-scale accretion flows funnel\nmaterial down to disk scales. These results reveal the under-appreciated\nimportance of the local environment on the formation and evolution of disks in\nearly systems$^{[13,14]}$ and a possible initial condition for the formation of\nannular features in young disks$^{[15,16]}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 11:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

The morphological changes in the flow due to the vortex-induced\nimpediment alters the dissolution rate, resulting in enhancement of droplet\nlifetime.

Solutions containing exponentially\nsmall terms exhibit a peculiarity known as the Stokes phenomenon, whereby waves\ncan 'switch-on' seemingly instantaneously across so-called Stokes lines,\npartitioning the fluid domain into wave-free regions and regions with waves. In\nthree dimensions, the Stokes line concept must extend to what are analogously\nknown as 'Stokes-surfaces'. This paper is concerned with the archetypal problem\nof uniform flow over a point source---reminiscent of, but separate to, the\nfamous Kelvin wave problem. In theory, there exist Stokes surfaces i.e.\nmanifolds in space that divide wave-free regions from regions with waves.\nPreviously, in Lustri & Chapman (2013) the intersection of the Stokes surface\nwith the free-surface, z=0, was found for the case of a linearised point-source\nobstruction.

However, measurements\nof cloud velocity dispersions with different lines, even in the same region,\noften yield inconsistent results. The reasons for this disagreement are not\nentirely clear since molecular line observations are subject to a number of\nbiases. In this paper, we untangle and investigate various factors that drive\nlinewidth measurement biases by constructing synthetic\nposition-position-velocity cubes for a variety of tracers from a suite of\nself-gravitating magnetohydrodynamic simulations of molecular clouds. We\ncompare linewidths derived from synthetic observations of these data cubes to\nthe true values in the simulations. We find that differences in linewidth as\nmeasured by different tracers are driven by a combination of density-dependent\nexcitation, whereby tracers that are sensitive to higher densities sample\nsmaller regions with smaller velocity dispersions, opacity broadening,\nespecially for highly optically thick tracers such as CO, and finite resolution\nand sensitivity, which suppress the wings of emission lines. We find that, at\nfixed signal to noise ratio, three commonly-used tracers, the J=4->3 line of\nCO, the J=1->0 line of C^{18}O and the (1,1) inversion transition of NH_3,\ngenerally offer the best compromise between these competing biases, and produce\nestimates of the velocity dispersion that reflect the true kinematics of a\nmolecular cloud to an accuracy of about 10% regardless of the cloud magnetic\nfield strengths, evolutionary state, or orientations of the line of sight\nrelative to the magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 12:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

This can be determined with small\nsample volumes in the same setup by measuring the droplet sedimentation\nvelocity. An interactive MATLAB script for extracting the capillary length from\na droplet image is included in the ESI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 12:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

However, in\nmost applications plastic deformation occurs, at least at the asperity level,\nwhich allows the surfaces to approach each other to such an extent that fluid\nleakage often can be neglected. In this study, we present an experimental\nset-up for studying the fluid leakage in metallic seals.

Most estimations of the ionization fraction have relied on\ndeuterated species such as DCO+, whose detection is limited to dense cores\nrepresenting an extremely small fraction of the volume of the giant molecular\nclouds they are part of. As large field-of-view hyperspectral maps become\navailable, new tracers may be found. We search for the best observable tracers\nof the ionization fraction based on a grid of astrochemical models. We build\ngrids of models that sample randomly a large space of physical conditions\n(unobservable quantities such as gas density, temperature, etc.) and compute\nthe corresponding observables (line intensities, column densities) and the\nionization fraction. We estimate the predictive power of each potential tracer\nby training a Random Forest model to predict the ionization fraction from that\ntracer, based on these model grids.

We find that, when the\nratio of the semimajor axes of the inner orbit and the disk radius takes very\nsmall values ($\\ll1$), and if the inclination between the inner orbit and the\ndisk is greater than the critical value of $30^\\circ$, the inner orbit will\nundergo the (classical) Lidov-Kozai resonance in which variations of\neccentricity and inclination are usually very large and the system has two\nequilibrium points at $\\omega=\\pi/2,3\\pi/2$ ($\\omega$ is the argument of\nperihelion). The critical value will slightly drop to about $27^\\circ$ as the\nratio increases to 0.4. However, the secular resonances will not occur for the\nouter orbit and the variations of the eccentricity and inclination are small.\nWhen the ratio of the orbit and the disk radius is nearly $1$, there are many\nmore complicated Lidov-Kozai resonance types which lead to the orbital\nbehaviors that are different from the classical Lidov-Kozai case. In these\nresonances, the system has more equilibrium points which could appear at\n$\\omega=0,\\pi/2,\\pi,3\\pi/2$, and even other values of $\\omega$. The variations\nof eccentricity and inclination become relatively moderate, moreover, in some\ncases the orbit can be maintained at a highly inclined state. In addition, a\nanalysis shows that a Kuzmin disk can also lead to the (classical) Lidov-Kozai\nresonance and the critical inclination is also $30^\\circ$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 14:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-09"}

Combining them into\nensembles yields state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, the ensembles of\nPCTs can be interpreted by calculating feature importance scores from the\nlearned models. However, their learning time scales poorly with the\ndimensionality of the output space. This is often problematic, especially in\n(hierarchical) multi-label classification, where the output can consist of\nhundreds of potential labels. Also, learning of PCTs can not exploit the\nsparsity of data to improve the computational efficiency, which is common in\nboth input (molecular fingerprints, bag of words representations) and output\nspaces (in multi-label classification, examples are often labeled with only a\nfraction of possible labels). In this paper, we propose oblique predictive\nclustering trees, capable of addressing these limitations. We design and\nimplement two methods for learning oblique splits that contain linear\ncombinations of features in the tests, hence a split corresponds to an\narbitrary hyperplane in the input space. The methods are efficient for high\ndimensional data and capable of exploiting sparse data. We experimentally\nevaluate the proposed methods on 60 benchmark datasets for 6 predictive\nmodeling tasks. The results of the experiments show that oblique predictive\nclustering trees achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art methods and\nare orders of magnitude faster than standard PCTs.

Using a case study area focused on\nhigh-rise buildings in Singapore, this paper examines a novel application of 3D\ncity models to identify suitable farming micro-locations in buildings. We\nspecifically investigate whether the vertical spaces of these buildings\ncomprising outdoor corridors, fa\\c{c}ades and windows receive sufficient\nphotosynthetically active radiation (PAR) for growing food crops and do so at a\nhigh resolution. We also analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics of PAR,\nand the impact of shadows and different weather conditions on PAR in the\nbuilding. Environmental simulations on the 3D model of the study area indicated\nthat the cumulative daily PAR or Daily Light Integral (DLI) at a location in\nthe building was dependent on its orientation and shape, sun's diurnal and\nannual motion, weather conditions, and shadowing effects of the building's\nfa\\c{c}ades and surrounding buildings. The DLI in the study area generally\nincreased with building's levels and, depending on the particular\nmicro-location, was found suitable for growing moderately light-demanding crops\nsuch as lettuce and sweet pepper. These variations in DLI at different\nlocations of the same building affirmed the need for such simulations. The\nsimulations were validated with field measurements of PAR, and correlation\ncoefficients between them exceeded 0.5 in most cases thus, making a case that\n3D city models offer a promising practical solution to identifying suitable\nfarming locations in residential buildings, and have the potential for\nurban-scale applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 12:04:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 03:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

For the\nlog-concave distribution function, the method converges exponentially fast, up\nto a controllable discretization error. However, the method requires the\nevaluation of a full gradient in each iteration, and for a problem on\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$, this amounts to $d$ times partial derivative evaluations per\niteration. The cost is high when $d\\gg1$. In this paper, we investigate how to\nenhance computational efficiency through the application of RCD (random\ncoordinate descent) on LMC. There are two sides of the theory:\n  1 By blindly applying RCD to LMC, one surrogates the full gradient by a\nrandomly selected directional derivative per iteration. Although the cost is\nreduced per iteration, the total number of iteration is increased to achieve a\npreset error tolerance. Ultimately there is no computational gain;\n  2 We then incorporate variance reduction techniques, such as SAGA (stochastic\naverage gradient) and SVRG (stochastic variance reduced gradient), into\nRCD-LMC. It will be proved that the cost is reduced compared with the classical\nLMC, and in the underdamped case, convergence is achieved with the same number\nof iterations, while each iteration requires merely one-directional derivative.\nThis means we obtain the best possible computational cost in the\nunderdamped-LMC framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2020 18:14:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 20:22:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 17:14:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 23:45:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2021 00:01:15 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 16:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2021 18:33:13 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 14:07:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

First, the population is divided\naccording to its compliance with disease control directives (lockdown,\nshelter-in-place, masks/face coverings, physical distancing, etc.) into those\nwho fully comply and those who follow the directives partially, or are\nnecessarily mobile (such as medical staff). This split, indirectly, reflects on\nthe quality and consistency of these measures. This allows the assessment of\nthe overall effectiveness of the control measures and the impact of their\nrelaxing or tightening on the disease spread. Second, the adequate contact\nrate, which directly affects the infection rate, is one of the model unknowns,\nas it keeps track of the changes in the population behavior and the\neffectiveness of various disease treatment modalities via a differential\ninclusion. Existence, uniqueness and positivity results are proved using a\nnonstandard convex analysis-based approach. As a case study, the pandemic\noutbreak in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) is simulated. The model\nparameters were found by minimizing the deviation of the model prediction from\nthe reported data over the first 100 days of the pandemic in South Korea.The\nsimulations show that the model captures accurately the pandemic dynamics in\nthe subsequent 75 days, which provides confidence in the model predictions and\nits future use. In particular, the model predicts that about 40% of the\ninfections were not documented, which implies that asymptomatic infections\ncontribute silently but substantially to the spread of the disease indicating\nthat more widespread asymptomatic testing is necessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 15:56:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 15:26:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

There are several methods to estimate the parameters\nof a linear regression model. These methods usually perform under normally\ndistributed and uncorrelated errors with zero mean and constant variance.\nHowever, for some data sets error terms may not satisfy these or some of these\nassumptions. If error terms are correlated, such as the regression models with\nautoregressive (AR(p)) error terms, the Conditional Maximum Likelihood (CML)\nunder normality assumption or the Least Square (LS) methods are often used to\nestimate the parameters of interest. For CML estimation a distributional\nassumption on error terms is needed to carry on estimation, but, in practice,\nsuch distributional assumptions on error terms may not be plausible. Therefore,\nin such cases some alternative distribution free methods are needed to conduct\nthe parameter estimation. In this paper, we propose to estimate the parameters\nof a linear regression model with AR(p) error term using the Empirical\nLikelihood (EL) method, which is one of the distribution free estimation\nmethods. A small simulation study and a numerical example are provided to\nevaluate the performance of the proposed estimation method over the CML method.\nThe results of simulation study show that the proposed estimators based on EL\nmethod are remarkably better than the estimators obtained from the CML method\nin terms of mean squared errors (MSE) and bias in almost all the simulation\nconfigurations. These findings are also confirmed by the results of the\nnumerical and real data examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2020 20:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

For\nsurgical robots, connectivity is necessary to accept software updates, accept\ninstructions, and transfer sensory data, but it also exposes the robot to\ncyberattacks, which can damage the patient or the surgeon. These injuries are\nnormally caused by safety failures, as seen in accidents with industrial\nrobots, but cyberattacks are caused by security failures instead. We create a\ntaxonomy for both types of failures in this paper specifically for surgical\nrobots. These robots are increasingly sold and used in the European Union (EU);\nwe therefore consider how surgical robots are viewed and treated by EU law.\nSpecifically, which rights regulators and manufacturers have, and which legal\nremedies and actions a patient or manufacturer would have in a single national\nlegal system in the union, if injuries were to occur from a security failure\ncaused by an adversary that cannot be unambiguously identified. We find that\nthe selected national legal system can adequately deal with attacks on surgical\nrobots, because it can on one hand efficiently compensate the patient. This is\nbecause of its flexibility; secondly, a remarkable absence of distinction\nbetween safety vs security causes of failure and focusing instead on the\ndetrimental effects, thus benefiting the patient; and third, liability can be\nremoved from the manufacturer by withdrawing its status as party if the patient\nchooses a separate public law measure to recover damages. Furthermore, we find\nthat current EU law does consider both security and safety aspects of surgical\nrobots, without it mentioning it through literal wording, but it also adds\nsubstantial liabilities and responsibilities to the manufacturers of surgical\nrobots, gives the patient special rights and confers immense powers on the\nregulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 13:04:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 14:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

In\nparticular, while CTLs in the pre-activation state move in a non-local search\npattern, the search pattern of activated CTLs is more localised. In this paper,\nwe develop a kinetic model for such a switch in CTL migration modes. The model\nis formulated as a coupled system of balance equations for the one-particle\ndistribution functions of CTLs in the pre-activation state, activated CTLs and\nDCs. CTL activation is modelled via binary interactions between CTLs in the\npre-activation state and DCs. Moreover, cell motion is represented as a\nvelocity-jump process, with the running time of CTLs in the pre-activation\nstate following a long-tailed distribution, which is consistent with a L\\'evy\nwalk, and the running time of activated CTLs following a Poisson distribution,\nwhich corresponds to Brownian motion. We formally show that the macroscopic\nlimit of the model comprises a coupled system of balance equations for the cell\ndensities whereby activated CTL movement is described via a classical diffusion\nterm, whilst a fractional diffusion term describes the movement of CTLs in the\npre-activation state. The modelling approach presented here and its possible\ngeneralisations are expected to find applications in the study of the immune\nresponse to cancer and in other biological contexts in which switch from\nnon-local to localised migration patterns occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 05:46:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 09:05:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 12:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}
