Without further incentives, pharmaceutical companies have little\ninterest in developing antibiotics, since the success probability is low and\ndevelopment costs are huge. The situation is exacerbated by the \"antibiotics\ndilemma\": Developing narrow-spectrum antibiotics against resistant bacteria is\nmost beneficial for society, but least attractive for companies since their\nusage is more limited than for broad-spectrum drugs and thus sales are low.\nStarting from a general mathematical framework for the study of\nantibiotic-resistance dynamics with an arbitrary number of antibiotics, we\nidentify efficient treatment protocols and introduce a market-based refunding\nscheme that incentivizes pharmaceutical companies to develop narrow-spectrum\nantibiotics: Successful companies can claim a refund from a newly established\nantibiotics fund that partially covers their development costs. The proposed\nrefund involves a fixed and variable part. The latter (i) increases with the\nuse of the new antibiotic for currently resistant strains in comparison with\nother newly developed antibiotics for this purpose---the resistance\npremium---and (ii) decreases with the use of this antibiotic for non-resistant\nbacteria. We outline how such a refunding scheme can solve the antibiotics\ndilemma and cope with various sources of uncertainty inherent in antibiotic\nR\\&D. Finally, connecting our refunding approach to the recently established\nantimicrobial resistance (AMR) action fund, we discuss how the antibiotics fund\ncan be financed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 16:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

In contrast to the\ntraditional approach where the channel state information (CSI) is estimated and\nquantized at each user independently, this paper shows that a joint design of\npilots and a new DNN architecture, which maps the received pilots directly into\nfeedback bits at the user side then maps the feedback bits from all the users\ndirectly into the precoding matrix at the BS, can significantly improve the\noverall performance. This paper further proposes robust design strategies with\nrespect to channel parameters and also a generalizable DNN architecture for\nvarying number of users and number of feedback bits. Numerical results show\nthat the DNN-based approach with short pilot sequences and very limited\nfeedback overhead can already approach the performance of conventional linear\nprecoding schemes with full CSI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 17:09:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 16:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

Our proposed method\nis based on generating synthetic ``transects'' of matched sample images that\nare designed to differ along specific attributes while leaving other attributes\nconstant. A crucial aspect of our approach is relying on the perception of\nhuman observers, both to guide manipulations, and to measure algorithmic bias.\n  Besides allowing the measurement of algorithmic bias, synthetic transects\nhave other advantages with respect to observational datasets: they sample\nattributes more evenly allowing for more straightforward bias analysis on\nminority and intersectional groups, they enable prediction of bias in new\nscenarios, they greatly reduce ethical and legal challenges, and they are\neconomical and fast to obtain, helping make bias testing affordable and widely\navailable.\n  We validate our method by comparing it to a study that employs the\ntraditional observational method for analyzing bias in gender classification\nalgorithms.

Our\nfiducial model has a mass contained within spherical radius $r=100{\\, \\rm pc}$\nof $M(r<100{\\, \\rm pc}) = 3.9 \\pm 1 \\times 10^8 {\\, \\rm M_\\odot}$ and a total\nmass of $M_{\\rm NSD} = 6.9 \\pm 2 \\times 10^8 {\\, \\rm M_\\odot}$. (ii) The NSD\nmight be the first example of a vertically biased disc, i.e. with ratio between\nthe vertical and radial velocity dispersion $\\sigma_z/\\sigma_R>1$. Observations\nand theoretical models of the star-forming molecular gas in the central\nmolecular zone suggest that large vertical oscillations may be already\nimprinted at stellar birth. However, the finding $\\sigma_z/\\sigma_R > 1$\ndepends on a drop in the velocity dispersion in the innermost few tens of\nparsecs, on our assumption that the NSD is axisymmetric, and that the available\n(extinction corrected) stellar samples broadly trace the underlying light and\nmass distributions, all of which need to be established by future observations\nand/or modelling. (iii) We provide the most accurate rotation curve to date for\nthe innermost $500 {\\, \\rm pc}$ of our Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 13:19:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Motivated by this, we perform a comprehensive study of the\nEoR 21-cm bispectrum using simulated signals. Given a model of reionization, we\ndemonstrate the behaviour of the bispectrum for all unique triangles in $k$\nspace. For ease of identification of the unique triangles, we parametrize the\n$k$-triangle space with two parameters, namely the ratio of the two arms of the\ntriangle ($n=k_2/k_1$) and the cosine of the angle between them\n($\\cos{\\theta}$).

While motivated by the sparse symmetric positive\ndefinite (SPD) matrix equations that arise from discretizing linear elliptic\nPDEs, the framework is purely algebraic such that it applies to matrices that\ndo not necessarily come from the continuum. Based on the so-called energy or\n$A$ norm, which is the natural norm for many problems involving SPD matrices,\nwe provide a normwise forward error analysis, and introduce the notion of\nprogressive precision for multigrid solvers. Each level of the multigrid\nhierarchy uses three different precisions that each increase with the fineness\nof the level, but at different rates, thereby ensuring that the bulk of the\ncomputation uses the lowest possible precision. The theoretical results\ndeveloped here in the energy norm differ notably from previous theory based on\nthe Euclidean norm in important ways.

In order\nto seamlessly integrate DERs into power systems, embedded devices are used to\nsupport the communication and control functions of DERs.

Towards\nreducing the attack surface, we present an authentication scheme for DERs,\nDERauth, which leverages the inherent entropy of the DER battery energy storage\nsystem (BESS) as a root-of-trust. The DER authentication is achieved using a\nchallenge-reply mechanism that relies on the corresponding DER's BESS\nstate-of-charge (SoC) and voltage measurements. A dynamically updating process\nensures that the BESS state is up-to-date.

It is often\nassumed that the achievable accuracy is limited by discretization or algebraic\nerrors. On the contrary, we show that the quantization error incurred by simply\nstoring the matrix in any fixed precision quickly begins to dominate the total\nerror as the discretization is refined. We extend the existing theory to\naccount for these quantization errors and use the resulting bounds to guide the\nchoice of four different precision levels in order to balance quantization,\nalgebraic, and discretization errors in the progressive-precision scheme\nproposed in the companion paper. A remarkable result is that while iterative\nrefinement is susceptible to quantization errors during the residual and update\ncomputation, the V-cycle used to compute the correction in each iteration is\nmuch more resilient, and continues to work if the system matrices in the\nhierarchy become indefinite due to quantization. As a result, the V-cycle only\nrequires relatively few bits of precision per level. Based on our findings, we\noutline a simple way to implement a progressive precision FMG solver with\nminimal overhead, and demonstrate as an example that the one dimensional\nbiharmonic equation can be solved reliably to any desired accuracy using just a\nfew V-cycles when the underlying smoother works well.

The geometry of the accretion flow strongly depends on\nthe magnetic obliquity, i.e., the angle between the rotational and magnetic\naxes. We aim at deriving the distribution of magnetic obliquities in a sample\nof 10 CTTSs. For this, we monitored the radial velocity variations of the\nHeI$\\lambda$5876 line in these stars' spectra along their rotational cycle. HeI\nis produced in the accretion shock, close to the magnetic pole. When the\nmagnetic and rotational axes are not aligned, the radial velocity of this line\nis modulated by stellar rotation. The amplitude of modulation is related to the\nstar's projected rotational velocity, $v\\sin i$, and the latitude of the\nhotspot. By deriving $v\\sin i$ and HeI$\\lambda$5876 radial velocity curves from\nour spectra we thus obtain an estimate of the magnetic obliquities. We find an\naverage obliquity in our sample of 11.4$^{\\circ}$ with an rms dispersion of\n5.4$^{\\circ}$.

Despite recent advances, existing methods for\nweakly-supervised temporal activity localization struggle to recognize when an\nactivity is not occurring. To address this issue, we propose a novel method\nnamed A2CL-PT. Two triplets of the feature space are considered in our\napproach: one triplet is used to learn discriminative features for each\nactivity class, and the other one is used to distinguish the features where no\nactivity occurs (i.e. background features) from activity-related features for\neach video. To further improve the performance, we build our network using two\nparallel branches which operate in an adversarial way: the first branch\nlocalizes the most salient activities of a video and the second one finds other\nsupplementary activities from non-localized parts of the video. Extensive\nexperiments performed on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet datasets demonstrate that our\nproposed method is effective.

Using planet\npopulation synthesis models, we explore the key physical factors that shape\nthis distribution: planets' solid core compositions, and their atmospheric\nstructure. For the former, we use equilibrium disk chemistry models to track\naccreted minerals onto planetary cores throughout formation. For the latter, we\ntrack gas accretion during formation, and consider photoevaporation-driven\natmospheric mass loss to determine what portion of accreted gas escapes after\nthe disk phase. We find that atmospheric stripping of Neptunes and sub-Saturns\nat small orbital radii ($\\lesssim$0.1AU) plays a key role in the formation of\nshort-period super Earths.

In this paper, we propose a generic scale-aware\nself-supervised pipeline for estimating depth, euclidean distance, and visual\nodometry from unrectified monocular videos. We demonstrate a similar level of\nprecision on the unrectified KITTI dataset with barrel distortion comparable to\nthe rectified KITTI dataset. The intuition being that the rectification step\ncan be implicitly absorbed within the CNN model, which learns the distortion\nmodel without increasing complexity. Our approach does not suffer from a\nreduced field of view and avoids computational costs for rectification at\ninference time. To further illustrate the general applicability of the proposed\nframework, we apply it to wide-angle fisheye cameras with 190$^\\circ$\nhorizontal field of view. The training framework UnRectDepthNet takes in the\ncamera distortion model as an argument and adapts projection and unprojection\nfunctions accordingly. The proposed algorithm is evaluated further on the KITTI\nrectified dataset, and we achieve state-of-the-art results that improve upon\nour previous work FisheyeDistanceNet. Qualitative results on a distorted test\nscene video sequence indicate excellent performance\nhttps://youtu.be/K6pbx3bU4Ss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 20:35:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2020 14:04:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 19:41:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 14:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

We assess the\nrobustness of the Area Rule, for both planar and non-planar loops, using\nhigh-resolution data from Direct Numerical Simulations. For planar loops, the\ncirculation moments for rectangular shapes match those for the square with only\nsmall differences, these differences being larger when the aspect ratio is\nfurther from unity, and when the moment-order increases. The differences do not\nexceed about $5\\%$ for any condition examined here. The aspect-ratio dependence\nobserved for the second-order moment are indistinguishable from results for the\nGaussian Random Field (GRF) with the same two-point correlation function (for\nwhich the results are order-independent by construction). When normalized by\nthe SD of the PDF, the aspect ratio dependence is even smaller $(< 2\\%)$ but\ndoes not vanish unlike for the GRF. We obtain circulation statistics around\nminimal area loops in three dimensions and compare them to those of a planar\nloop circumscribing equivalent areas, and we find that circulation statistics\nmatch in the two cases only when normalized by an internal variable such as the\nSD.

The nonlinear DNS shows\nsaturation of the fundamental frequency, and the resulting superharmonics\ninduce tightly braided ``rope-like'' patterns near the generalized inflection\npoint (GIP). The instability exhibits a second region of growth constituted by\nthe fundamental frequency, downstream of the primary envelope, which is absent\nin the linear scenario. Subsequent 3D DNS identifies this region to be crucial\nin amplifying oblique instabilities riding on the 2D second-mode ``rollers''.\nThis results in lambda vortices below the GIP, which are detached from the\n``rollers'' in the inner boundary layer. Streamwise vortex-stretching results\nin a localized peak in length-scales inside the HBL, eventually forming haripin\nvortices.

Successful models describing charge- and\nenergy-transport in these systems routinely include these effects. Most models\nfor describing photophysics, on the other hand, only incorporate local\nelectron-phonon coupling to intramolecular vibrational modes, while nonlocal\nelectron-phonon coupling is neglected. One might expect nonlocal coupling to\nhave an important effect on the photophysics of organic crystals, because it\ngives rise to large fluctuation in the charge-transfer couplings, and\ncharge-transfer couplings play an important role in the spectroscopy of many\norganic crystals. Here, we study the effects of nonlocal coupling on the\nabsorption spectrum of crystalline pentacene and 7,8,15,16-tetraazaterrylene.\nTo this end, we develop a new mixed quantum-classical approach for including\nnonlocal coupling into spectroscopic and transport models for organic crystals.\nImportantly, our approach does not assume that the nonlocal coupling is linear,\nin contrast to most modern charge-transport models. We find that the nonlocal\ncoupling broadens the absorption spectrum non-uniformly across the absorption\nline shape. In pentacene, for example, our model predicts that the lower\nDavydov component broadens considerably more than the upper Davydov component,\nexplaining the origin of this experimental observation for the first time. By\nstudying a simple dimer model, we are able to attribute this selective\nbroadening to correlations between the fluctuations of the charge-transfer\ncouplings. Overall, our method incorporates nonlocal electron-phonon coupling\ninto spectroscopic and transport models with computational efficiency,\ngeneralizability to a wide range of organic crystals, and without any\nassumption of linearity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 22:52:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 17:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Activation in a protein differs from activation in a small molecule\nin that it involves directed and systematic energy flows through preferred\nchannels encoded in the protein structure. Understanding the nature of these\nenergy flow channels and how energy flows through them during activation is\ncritical for understanding protein conformational changes. We recently\ndeveloped a rigorous statistical mechanical framework for understanding\npotential energy flows. Here we complete this theoretical framework with a\nrigorous theory for kinetic energy flows: potential and kinetic energy\ninter-convert when impressed forces oppose inertial forces whereas kinetic\nenergy transfers directly from one coordinate to another when inertial forces\noppose each other. This theory is applied to analyzing a prototypic system for\nbiomolecular conformational dynamics: the isomerization of an alanine\ndipeptide. Among the two essential energy flow channels for this process,\ndihedral phi confronts the activation barrier, whereas dihedral theta receives\nenergy from potential energy flows. Intriguingly, theta helps phi to cross the\nactivation barrier by transferring to phi via direct kinetic energy flow all\nthe energy it received: increase in theta caused by potential energy flow\nconverts into increase in phi. As a compensation, theta receives kinetic energy\nfrom bond angle alpha via direct mechanism and bond angle beta via indirect\nmechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 23:27:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

A realistic scenario is numerically\nmodelled, where the photon pairs with nonzero emission angle gather a phase\ndifference. These pairs can still be collected and manipulated for practical\nuse but the collection optics adds upon the phase difference. Two commercially\navailable optics for collection; aspheric and achromatic lenses are compared.\nThe numerical simulation results are compared with the experimental results to\nvalidate the built model for predicting the maximum achievable entanglement\nfidelity. The results indicate that the fidelity can be accurately estimated\nwith the presented model by inserting the experimental parameters to it. The\nstudy is expected to be very useful for preparation and optimization of\nentangled photon pair sources in critical phase-matching configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 00:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

We\nintroduce a computer vision system that estimates water depth from social media\nimages taken during flooding events, in order to build flood maps in (near)\nreal-time.

To address this shortcoming, we derive\nstronger formulations that scale well with respect to the sample size.

First, it is very compact such that we are orders of\nmagnitude smaller while still keeping strong modeling capacity. Second, because\neach joint has its semantic meaning, interactive facial geometry editing is\nmade easier and more intuitive. Third, through skinning, our model supports\nadding mouth interior and eyes, as well as accessories (hair, eye glasses,\netc.) in a simpler, more accurate and principled way.

The two standard ways to analyse an\nexperimental structure factor are then to compare it either to structure\nfactors computed from simulated systems, or to analytical structure factors\ncalculated from approximated systems. For liquids of monodisperse hard spheres,\nthe latter method provides analytical structure factors through the\nOrnstein-Zernike equation used with the Percus-Yevick closure equation.

With theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations we\ndiscuss the influence of LE time response (LTR) on the timing analysis from\nthree aspects: the power spectral density, the pulse profile and the time lag.\nAfter the LTR, the value of power spectral density monotonously decreases with\nthe increasing frequency. The power spectral density of a sinusoidal signal\nreduces by a half at frequency 536 Hz. The corresponding frequency for QPO\nsignals is 458 Hz. The Root mean square (RMS) of QPOs holds the similar\nbehaviour. After the LTR, the centroid frequency and full width at half maxima\n(FWHM) of QPOs signals do not change. The LTR reduces the RMS of pulse profiles\nand shifts the pulse phase. In the time domain, the LTR only reduces the peak\nvalue of the crosscorrelation function while it does not change the peak\nposition. Thus it will not affect the result of the time lag.

In nuclear physics, a\nnucleon localization function (NLF) has been used to characterize clusters in\nlight nuclei, fragment formation in fission and pasta phases in the inner crust\nof neutron stars.\n  Purpose: We use the NLF to study the nuclear response to fast rotation.\n  Methods: We generalize the NLF to the case of nuclear rotation. The extended\nexpressions involve both time-even and time-odd local densities. Since current\ndensity and density gradient contribute to the NLF primarily at the surface, we\npropose a simpler spatial measure given by the kinetic-energy density.\nIllustrative calculations for the superdeformed yrast band of $^{152}$Dy were\ncarried out by using the cranked Skyrme-Hartree-Fock method. We also employed\nthe cranked harmonic-oscillator model to gain insights into patterns revealed\nby the NLF at high angular momentum.\n  Results: In a deformed rotating nucleus, several NLFs can be introduced,\ndepending on the definition of the spin-quantization axis and self-consistent\nsymmetries of the system. The oscillating pattern of the NLF can be explained\nby a constructive interference between the kinetic-energy and particle\ndensities. The nodal pattern seen in the NLF along the major axis of a rotating\nnucleus comes from single-particle orbits with large aligned angular momentum.\nThe variation of the NLF along the minor axis is traced back to\ndeformation-aligned orbits.\n  Conclusions: The NLF allows a simple interpretation of the shell structure\nevolution in the rotating nucleus in terms of the angular-momentum alignment of\nindividual nucleons. We expect that the NLF will be useful for the\ncharacterization of other collective modes and time-dependent processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 03:50:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 05:38:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 23:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-09"}

As in the\ncase of hexadecane-in-water (h/w) emulsions, it is found that flocculation\nrates apparently decrease with the ionic strength, departing appreciably from\ntheoretical predictions. Since many-particle simulations proved to be very time\nconsuming, an accurate knowledge of experimental parameters is necessary prior\nto the realization of further evaluations. Here, the change in the viscosity of\nthe aqueous solution due to the surfactant phase behavior is considered as a\npossible cause of referred phenomenon. The influence of the external viscosity\non the outcome of the simulations is appraised using a quotient between the\nactual viscosity of the surfactant solution at a given salt concentration and\nits value in the absence of salt. For that purpose, the viscosity of 0.5 and\n7.5 mM SDS solutions was measured between 300 an 900 mM NaCl for temperatures\nof 20 and 25 {\\deg}C. It is concluded that the augment of the aqueous viscosity\ndue to the formation of surfactant crystals diminish significantly the\naggregation rate. Yet this decline seems insufficient to justify the observed\nreduction of kFC at 25 C. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that a 5-degree change\nin the temperature of the surfactant solution causes a remarkable decrease of\nkFC . Additionally, a set of two-particle simulations is used here to\nillustrate the limitations of this methodology for the appraisal of the\nviscosity contribution.

In this work, for\nmeta-learning, we find that the main challenges focus on related or irrelevant\nsemantic features between categories.

The TCL-C exploits the true-label prediction and the most\nlikely C-1 false classification predictions to improve detection performance on\nfew-shot classes. According to similar appearance (i.e., visual appearance,\nshape, and limbs etc.) and environment in which objects often appear, the\ncategory-based grouping mechanism splits categories into disjoint groups to\nmake similar semantic features more compact between categories within a group\nand obtain more significant difference between groups, alleviating the strong\nbias problem and further improving detection APs. The whole training consists\nof the base model and the fine-tuning phases. According to grouping mechanism,\nwe group the meta-features vectors obtained by meta-model, so that the\ndistribution difference between groups is obvious, and the one within each\ngroup is less.

In addition, our model does not assume that users' opinions are\nrational in order to extract information from it, an assumption that\nsignificantly limits current approaches. Instead, we define a weaker notion of\nrationality that characterises coherent opinions, and we consider different\nscenarios based on the coherence of individual opinions and the level of\nconsensus that users have on the debate structure. Considering these two\nfactors, we analyse the outcomes of different opinion aggregation functions\nthat compute a collective decision based on the individual opinions and the\ndebate structure. In particular, we demonstrate that aggregated opinions can be\ncoherent even if there is a lack of consensus and individual opinions are not\ncoherent. We conclude our analysis with a computational evaluation\ndemonstrating that collective opinions can be computed efficiently for\nreal-sized debates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 06:55:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Under various\nconditions on LSEMs and the model parameters the prior work provides efficient\nalgorithms to recover the parameters. However, these results are often about\ngeneric identifiability. In practice, generic identifiability is not sufficient\nand we need robust identifiability: small changes in the observational data\nshould not affect the parameters by a huge amount. Robust identifiability has\nreceived far less attention and remains poorly understood. Sankararaman et al.\n(2019) recently provided a set of sufficient conditions on parameters under\nwhich robust identifiability is feasible. However, a limitation of their work\nis that their results only apply to a small sub-class of LSEMs, called\n``bow-free paths.'' In this work, we significantly extend their work along\nmultiple dimensions. First, for a large and well-studied class of LSEMs, namely\n``bow free'' models, we provide a sufficient condition on model parameters\nunder which robust identifiability holds, thereby removing the restriction of\npaths required by prior work. We then show that this sufficient condition holds\nwith high probability which implies that for a large set of parameters robust\nidentifiability holds and that for such parameters, existing algorithms already\nachieve robust identifiability. Finally, we validate our results on both\nsimulated and real-world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 07:32:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Comparing with existing\nmethods, H-VGRAE has three main advantages: 1) H-VGRAE learns robust node\nrepresentations through stochasticity modeling and the extraction of\nmulti-scale spatial-temporal features; 2) H-VGRAE can be extended to deep\nstructure with the increase of the dynamic network scale; 3) the anomalous edge\nand node can be located and interpreted from the probabilistic perspective.\nExtensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the\noutperformance of H-VGRAE on anomaly detection in dynamic networks compared\nwith state-of-the-art competitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 08:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

In a collisionless shock, shock accelerated\nparticles going back and forth around the front can invalid the first\nassumption. In addition, an external magnetic field can sustain stable pressure\nanisotropies, invaliding the second assumption. It is therefore unclear whether\nthe density jump of a collisionless shock fulfils the MHD jump or not.\n  Here we try to clarify this issue. A literature review is conducted on 68\narticles dealing with Particle-In-Cell simulations of collisionless shocks. We\nanalyze the factors triggering departure from the MHD density jump and quantify\ntheir influence on $\\Delta_{RH}$, the relative departure from the\nRankine-Hugoniot jump. For small departures we propose $\\Delta_{RH} = +\n\\mathcal{O}(10^{-1-3.7\\kappa})t^\\kappa - \\sigma \\mathcal{O}(1)$ where $t$ is\nthe timescale of the simulation, $\\sigma$ the magnetization parameter and\n$\\kappa$ a constant of order unity.

This\nrelation allows to assess to which extent a collisionless shock fulfils the RH\ndensity jump.\n  In the strong field limit and for parallel shocks, the departure caused by\nthe field saturates at a finite, negative, value.

These types of disruptions may arise from\ncatastrophic collisions of planetesimals, which are perturbed from their\noriginal orbits in the Fomalhaut dust ring by nearby giant planets. However,\ndisruptions can also occur when the planetesimals pass within the tidal\ndisruption field of the planet(s) that perturbed them in the first place,\nsimilar to the Shoemaker-Levy event observed in the Solar System. Given that a\ngravitationally focusing giant planet has a much larger interaction\ncross-section than a planetesimal, tidal disruption events can match or\noutnumber planetesimal collision events in realistic regions of parameter\nspace. Intriguingly, the Fomalhaut dust cloud offers an opportunity to directly\ndistinguish between these scenarios.

Analysis and testing of\nstring-manipulating programs can be formulated as the path feasibility problem:\ngiven a symbolic execution path, does there exist an assignment to the inputs\nthat yields a concrete execution that realizes this path? Such a problem can\nnaturally be reformulated as a string constraint solving problem. Although\nstate-of-the-art string constraint solvers usually provide support for both\nstring and integer data types, they mainly resort to heuristics without\ncompleteness guarantees.

The art gallery problem seeks a\nminimum size set $G\\subset P$ of guards that sees $P$ completely. The only\ncurrently correct algorithm to solve the art gallery problem exactly uses\nalgebraic methods and is attributed to Sharir. As the art gallery problem is\nER-complete, it seems unlikely to avoid algebraic methods, without additional\nassumptions. In this paper, we introduce the notion of vision stability. In\norder to describe vision stability consider an enhanced guard that can see\n\"around the corner\" by an angle of $\\delta$ or a diminished guard whose vision\nis by an angle of $\\delta$ \"blocked\" by reflex vertices. A polygon $P$ has\nvision stability $\\delta$ if the optimal number of enhanced guards to guard $P$\nis the same as the optimal number of diminished guards to guard $P$. We will\nargue that most relevant polygons are vision stable. We describe a one-shot\nvision stable algorithm that computes an optimal guard set for visionstable\npolygons using polynomial time and solving one integer program. It guarantees\nto find the optimal solution for every vision stable polygon. We implemented an\niterative visionstable algorithm and show its practical performance is slower,\nbut comparable with other state of the art algorithms. Our iterative algorithm\nis inspired and follows closely the one-shot algorithm. It delays several steps\nand only computes them when deemed necessary. Given a chord $c$ of a polygon,\nwe denote by $n(c)$ the number of vertices visible from $c$. The chord-width of\na polygon is the maximum $n(c)$ over all possible chords $c$. The set of vision\nstable polygons admits an FPT algorithm when parametrized by the chord-width.\nFurthermore, the one-shot algorithm runs in FPT time, when parameterized by the\nnumber of reflex vertices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 09:09:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 09:49:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 12:18:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 13:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

In this paper, we present a novel graph-based interactive\nreasoning model called Interactive Graph (abbr. in-Graph) to infer HOIs, in\nwhich interactive semantics implied among visual targets are efficiently\nexploited. The proposed model consists of a project function that maps related\ntargets from convolution space to a graph-based semantic space, a message\npassing process propagating semantics among all nodes and an update function\ntransforming the reasoned nodes back to convolution space.

While existing methods recover structures and textures\nstep-by-step in the hole regions, they typically use two encoder-decoders for\nseparate recovery. The CNN features of each encoder are learned to capture\neither missing structures or textures without considering them as a whole. The\ninsufficient utilization of these encoder features limit the performance of\nrecovering both structures and textures. In this paper, we propose a mutual\nencoder-decoder CNN for joint recovery of both. We use CNN features from the\ndeep and shallow layers of the encoder to represent structures and textures of\nan input image, respectively. The deep layer features are sent to a structure\nbranch and the shallow layer features are sent to a texture branch. In each\nbranch, we fill holes in multiple scales of the CNN features. The filled CNN\nfeatures from both branches are concatenated and then equalized. During feature\nequalization, we reweigh channel attentions first and propose a bilateral\npropagation activation function to enable spatial equalization. To this end,\nthe filled CNN features of structure and texture mutually benefit each other to\nrepresent image content at all feature levels.

They are based on minimizing the maximum absolute or relative error,\nresulting in globally uniform error functions with equalized extrema. In\nparticular, we construct sets of equations that describe the behaviour of the\ntargeted error functions and solve them numerically in order to find the\noptimized sets of coefficients for the sum of exponentials. This also allows\nfor establishing a trade-off between absolute and relative error by controlling\nweights assigned to the error functions' extrema. We further extend the\nproposed procedure to derive approximations and bounds for any polynomial of\nthe Q-function, which in turn allows approximating and bounding many functions\nof the Q-function that meet the Taylor series conditions, and consider the\ninteger powers of the Q-function as a special case. In the numerical results,\nother known approximations of the same and different forms as well as those\nobtained directly from quadrature rules are compared with the proposed\napproximations and bounds to demonstrate that they achieve increasingly better\naccuracy in terms of the global error, thus requiring significantly lower\nnumber of sum terms to achieve the same level of accuracy than any reference\napproach of the same form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 09:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-21"}

While this problem has\nbeen alleviated by end-to-end training of multi-source sequence-to-sequence\nmodels recently, these neural models do not explicitly analyze the relations\nbetween hypotheses and fail to capture their agreement because the attention to\na word in a hypothesis is calculated independently, ignoring the fact that the\nword might occur in multiple hypotheses. In this work, we propose an approach\nto modeling voting for system combination in machine translation. The basic\nidea is to enable words in hypotheses from different systems to vote on words\nthat are representative and should get involved in the generation process. This\ncan be done by quantifying the influence of each voter and its preference for\neach candidate. Our approach combines the advantages of statistical and neural\nmethods since it can not only analyze the relations between hypotheses but also\nallow for end-to-end training. Experiments show that our approach is capable of\nbetter taking advantage of the consensus between hypotheses and achieves\nsignificant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on Chinese-English and\nEnglish-German machine translation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 09:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Although several frequentist methods have been developed\nfor estimation, inference and classification within such a class of models,\nBayesian inference is still lagging behind. This is due to the apparent absence\nof a tractable class of conjugate priors, that may facilitate posterior\ninference on the multinomial probit coefficients. Such an issue has motivated\nincreasing efforts toward the development of effective Markov chain Monte Carlo\nmethods, but state-of-the-art solutions still face severe computational\nbottlenecks, especially in high dimensions. In this article, we show that the\nentire class of unified skew-normal (SUN) distributions is conjugate to several\nmultinomial probit models. Leveraging this result and the SUN properties, we\nimprove upon state-of-the-art solutions for posterior inference and\nclassification both in terms of closed-form results for several functionals of\ninterest, and also by developing novel computational methods relying either on\nindependent and identically distributed samples from the exact posterior or on\nscalable and accurate variational approximations based on blocked\npartially-factorized representations.

Efficiency is assessed by comparing input and\noutput data for each DMU via linear programming. Traditionally in DEA, the data\nare considered to be exact. However, in many real-world applications, it is\nlikely that the values for the input and output data used in the analysis are\nimprecise. To account for this, we develop the uncertain DEA problem for the\ncase of box uncertainty. We introduce the notion of DEA distance to determine\nthe minimum amount of uncertainty required for a DMU to be deemed efficient.\nFor small problems, the minimum amount of uncertainty can be found exactly, for\nlarger problems this becomes computationally intensive. Therefore, we propose\nan iterative method, where the amount of uncertainty is gradually increased.\nThis results in a robust DEA problem that can be solved efficiently.

Many ``structured models'' capture aspects of the contact\nstructure through an underlying network or a mixing matrix. An important\nobservation in such models, is that once a fraction $1-1/\\mathcal{R}_0$ has\nbeen infected, the residual susceptible population can no longer sustain an\nepidemic. A recent observation of some structured models is that this threshold\ncan be crossed with a smaller fraction of infected individuals, because the\ndisease acts like a targeted vaccine, preferentially immunizing higher-risk\nindividuals who play a greater role in transmission. Therefore, a limited\n``first wave'' may leave behind a residual population that cannot support a\nsecond wave once interventions are lifted. In this paper, we systematically\nanalyse a number of mean-field models for networks and other structured\npopulations to address issues relevant to the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular,\nwe consider herd-immunity under several scenarios. We confirm that, in networks\nwith high degree heterogeneity, the first wave confers herd-immunity with\nsignificantly fewer infections than equivalent models with lower degree\nheterogeneity. However, if modelling the intervention as a change in the\ncontact network, then this effect might become more subtle. Indeed, modifying\nthe structure can shield highly connected nodes from becoming infected during\nthe first wave and make the second wave more substantial. We confirm this\nfinding by using an age-structured compartmental model parameterised with real\ndata and comparing lockdown periods implemented either as a global scaling of\nthe mixing matrix or age-specific structural changes. We find that results\nregarding herd immunity levels are strongly dependent on the model, the\nduration of lockdown and how lockdown is implemented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 11:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

The analysis of these entanglement networks reveals that\nthe gradual establishment of quasi-long range order is accompanied by a\nsymmetry regarding single-spin concurrence distributions, as well as by\ninstabilities in the network topology. Moreover, we identify the existence of\nemergent entanglement structures, spatially localised communities enforced by\nthe global symmetry of the system that can be revealed by model-agnostic\ncommunity detection algorithms. The network representation further unveils the\nexistence of structural classes and a cyclic self-similarity in the state,\nwhich we conjecture to be intimately linked to the community structure.

However, the origin of these mutual inclinations remains\nunknown. Recent work has demonstrated that mutual inclinations can be excited\nsoon after protoplanetary disk-dispersal due to the oblateness of the\nrapidly-rotating host star, provided the star is tilted. Alternatively, distant\ngiant planets, which are common in systems of close-in Kepler planets, could\ndrive up mutual inclinations. The relative importance of each of these\nmechanisms has not been investigated. Here, we show that the influence of the\nstellar oblateness typically exceeds that of an exterior giant soon after\nplanet formation. However, the magnitude of the resulting mutual inclinations\ndepends critically upon the timescale over which the natal disk disperses.\nSpecifically, we find that if the disk vanishes over a timescale shorter than\n10^(3-4) years, comparable to the viscous timescale of the inner ~0.2AU, the\ninner planets impulsively acquire misalignments that scale with the stellar\nobliquity. In contrast, if the disk disperses slowly, the inner planets remain\ncoplanar. They first align with the stellar equator but subsequently realign\nwith the distant giant's plane as the star spins down. Our findings are\nconsistent with recent observations that giants tend to be aligned with\nclose-in multis but misaligned with singles. Stellar obliquity measurements\noffer a promising test of our proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 12:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

This is not realistic in\nlarge-scale face recognition, where one must contend with such overlaps, the\nfrequency of which increases with the volume of data. Ignoring identity overlap\nleads to significant labeling noise, as data from the same identity is split\ninto multiple clusters.

To establish this relation, we\nintroduce the bulk Green function, which describes the response of a gapped\nsystem to an external perturbation on timescales where the induced excitations\nhave not propagated to the boundary yet, and show that it will grow in space if\nthe non-Hermitian winding number is nonzero. Such spatial growth explains why\nthe response of non-Hermitian systems on longer timescales, where excitations\nhave been reflected at the boundary repeatedly, may be highly sensitive to\nboundary conditions. This exponential sensitivity to boundary conditions\nexplains the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian\nsystems: topological invariants computed for periodic boundary conditions no\nlonger predict the presence or absence of boundary states for open boundary\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 13:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

This has now been supported by observations of hundreds of thousands\nof red giant stars (Brown et al. 1989, Kumar et al. 2011, Deepak et al. 2019,\nSingh et al. 2019, Casey et al. 2019). Here we perform the first large-scale\nsystematic investigation into the Li content of stars in the red clump phase of\nevolution, which directly follows the red giant branch phase. Surprisingly we\nfind that all red clump stars have high levels of lithium for their\nevolutionary stage. On average the lithium content increases by a factor of 40\nafter the end of the red giant branch stage. This suggests that all low-mass\nstars undergo a lithium production phase between the tip of the red giant\nbranch and the red clump. We demonstrate that our finding is not predicted by\nstellar theory, revealing a stark tension between observations and models. We\nalso show that the heavily studied (Brown et al. 1989, Reddy et al. 2005, Kumar\net al. 2011, Singh et al. 2019, Casey et al. 2019) very Li-rich giants, with\nA(Li) $> +1.5$ dex, represent only the extreme tail of the lithium enhancement\ndistribution, comprising 3% of red clump stars. Our findings suggest a new\ndefinition limit for Li-richness in red clump stars, A(Li) $> -0.9$ dex, which\nis much lower than the limit of A(Li) $> +1.5$ dex used over many decades\n(Brown et al. 1989, Castilho et al. 1995, Reddy et al. 2005, Carlberg et al.\n2016, Casey et al. 2019, Holanda et al. 2020).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 14:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Previous work has shown that CPU frequency\nscaling can be used as a covert channel to transmit information between\notherwise isolated processes. Modern systems either try to save power or try to\noperate near their power limits in order to maximize performance, so they\nimplement mechanisms to vary the frequency based on load. Existing covert\nchannels based on this approach are either easily thwarted by software\ncountermeasures or only work on completely idle systems. In this paper, we show\nhow the automatic frequency scaling provided by Intel Turbo Boost can be used\nto construct a covert channel that is both hard to prevent without significant\nperformance impact and can tolerate significant background system load. As\nIntel Turbo Boost selects the maximum CPU frequency based on the number of\nactive cores, our covert channel modulates information onto the maximum CPU\nfrequency by placing load on multiple additional CPU cores. Our prototype of\nthe covert channel achieves a throughput of up to 61 bit/s on an idle system\nand up to 43 bit/s on a system with 25% utilization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 14:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Second, we propose an adaptive feature\nselection (AFS) module to select saliency-related features and suppress the\ninferior ones.

In our approach, an\nAdversarial Texture Augmentation Network (ATANet) first superimposes the\ntexture of a degraded reference image over a clean image. Later, the clean\nimage along with its generated degraded version constitute the pseudo\npaired-data which is used to train the Unsupervised Document Binarization\nNetwork (UDBNet).

The theoretical model\nis numerically implemented using a mixed finite element formulation and several\nboundary value problems are addressed to gain physical insight and showcase\nmodel predictions. The results reveal the critical role of plastic strain\ngradients in rationalising decohesion-based arguments and capturing the\ntransition to brittle fracture observed in hydrogen-rich environments. Large\ncrack tip stresses are predicted, which in turn raise the hydrogen\nconcentration and reduce the fracture energy. The computation of the steady\nstate fracture toughness as a function of the cohesive strength shows that\ncleavage fracture can be predicted in otherwise ductile metals using sensible\nvalues for the material parameters and the hydrogen concentration.

Model predictions are also compared with fracture\nexperiments on a modern ultra-high strength steel, AerMet100. A promising\nagreement is observed with experimental measurements of threshold stress\nintensity factor $K_{th}$ over a wide range of applied potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 15:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

To disprove/reaffirm the latter concept, in this\npaper we analyse temperature dependent in-plane coherence length in FeSe,\nFeSe1-xTex, Ba(Fe1-x(Co,Ni)x)2As2 and Ca10(Pt4As8)((Fe,Pt)2As2)5 in order to\nextract the gap-to-critical-temperature ratio, 2$\\Delta$(0)/$k$$_B$$T$$_c$, and\nthe specific-heat-jump ratio, $\\Delta$C/C,in these compounds. In the result, we\nreport that deduced ratios are in a good agreement with the concept of\nsingle-band $p$-wave superconductivity in these materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 15:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-21"}

Water in these porous films is either\nincorporated directly in the oxide structure (structural) and/or fills the\npores (morphological). This preliminary study demonstrates that the differences\nin water content of porous anodic Al oxide layers are strongly related to the\noxide growth parameters but interestingly cannot be directly correlated to a\nspecific change in the amorphous oxide structure or in the pore morphology. Due\nto the high sensitivity of high-resolution neutron imaging to small changes in\nthe water content, we furthermore show that the morphological water content in\nAl oxides formed in sulfuric acid as well as in phosphoric acid is partially\nreversible upon heat treatment and immersion.

However, convolutional neural networks, operating as\nblack-box systems, generally do not provide a reliable measure about the\nconfidence of their decisions. This leads to various problems in industrial\nsettings, amongst others, inadequate levels of trust from users in the model's\noutputs as well as a non-compliance with current policy guidelines (e.g., EU AI\nStrategy). To address these issues, we use uncertainty measures based on\nMonte-Carlo dropout in the context of a human-in-the-loop system to increase\nthe system's transparency and performance. In particular, we demonstrate the\nbenefits described above on a real-world multi-class image segmentation task of\nwear analysis in the machining industry. Following previous work, we show that\nthe quality of a prediction correlates with the model's uncertainty.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that a multiple linear regression using the\nmodel's uncertainties as independent variables significantly explains the\nquality of a prediction (\\(R^2=0.718\\)). Within the uncertainty-based\nhuman-in-the-loop system, the multiple regression aims at identifying failed\npredictions on an image-level.

However, irregular applications struggle to fully realize\nGPGPU performance as a result of control flow divergence and memory divergence\ndue to irregular memory access patterns.\n  To ameliorate these issues, programmers are obligated to carefully consider\narchitecture features and devote significant efforts to modify the algorithms\nwith complex optimization techniques, which shift programmers priorities yet\nstruggle to quell the shortcomings. We show that in graph-based GPGPU irregular\napplications these inefficiencies prevail, yet we find that it is possible to\nrelax the strict relationship between thread and data processed to empower new\noptimizations.\n  Based on this key idea, we propose the Irregular accesses Reorder Unit (IRU),\na novel hardware extension tightly integrated in the GPGPU pipeline. The IRU\nreorders data processed by the threads on irregular accesses which\nsignificantly improves memory coalescing, and allows increased performance and\nenergy efficiency. Additionally, the IRU is capable of filtering and merging\nduplicated irregular access which further improves graph-based irregular\napplications. Programmers can easily utilize the IRU with a simple API, or\ncompiler optimized generated code with the extended ISA instructions provided.\n  We evaluate our proposal for state-of-the-art graph-based algorithms and a\nwide selection of applications. Results show that the IRU achieves a memory\ncoalescing improvement of 1.32x and a 46% reduction in the overall traffic in\nthe memory hierarchy, which results in 1.33x and 13% improvement in performance\nand energy savings respectively, while incurring in a small 5.6% area overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 15:51:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 21:01:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

This problem is\nconsidered for wireless networks where each communication link has a minimum\nbandwidth quality-of-service (QoS) requirement. Links in the same vicinity\ncontend for the shared wireless medium. The conflict graph captures which pairs\nof links interfere with each other and depends on the MAC protocol. In IEEE\n802.11 MAC protocol-based networks, when communication between nodes $i$ and\n$j$ takes place, the neighbors of both $i$ and $j$ remain silent. This model of\ninterference is called the $2$-hop interference model because the distance in\nthe network graph between any two links that can be simultaneously active is at\nleast $2$.

This\ntask is extremely challenging because some sounds generated \\emph{outside} a\ncamera can not be inferred from video content. The model may be forced to learn\nan incorrect mapping between visual content and these irrelevant sounds. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a framework named REGNET. In this framework,\nwe first extract appearance and motion features from video frames to better\ndistinguish the object that emits sound from complex background information. We\nthen introduce an innovative audio forwarding regularizer that directly\nconsiders the real sound as input and outputs bottlenecked sound features.\nUsing both visual and bottlenecked sound features for sound prediction during\ntraining provides stronger supervision for the sound prediction. The audio\nforwarding regularizer can control the irrelevant sound component and thus\nprevent the model from learning an incorrect mapping between video frames and\nsound emitted by the object that is out of the screen. During testing, the\naudio forwarding regularizer is removed to ensure that REGNET can produce\npurely aligned sound only from visual features. Extensive evaluations based on\nAmazon Mechanical Turk demonstrate that our method significantly improves both\ntemporal and content-wise alignment. Remarkably, our generated sound can fool\nthe human with a 68.12% success rate.
