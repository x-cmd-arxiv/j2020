However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the prior\nworks on OTFS have derived it from first principles. In this paper, using the\nZAK representation of time-domain (TD) signals, we rigorously derive an\northonormal basis of approximately time and bandwidth limited signals which are\nalso localized in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. We then consider DD domain\nmodulation based on this orthonormal basis, and derive OTFS modulation. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first paper to rigorously derive OTFS\nmodulation from first principles. We show that irrespective of the amount of\nDoppler shift, the received DD domain basis signals are localized in a small\ninterval of size roughly equal to the inverse time duration along the Doppler\ndomain and of size roughly equal to the inverse bandwidth along the delay\ndomain (time duration refers to the length of the time-interval where the TD\ntransmit signal has been limited). With sufficiently large time duration and\nbandwidth, there is little interference between information symbols modulated\non different basis signals, which allows for joint DD domain equalization of\nall information symbols. This explains the inherent robustness of DD domain\nmodulation to channel induced Doppler shift when compared with Orthogonal\nFrequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). The degree of localization of the DD\ndomain basis signals is inversely related to the time duration of the transmit\nsignal, which explains the trade-off between robustness to Doppler shift and\nlatency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 16:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

With the\naim of assessing both the dynamics of the introduction of the virus and the\neffectiveness of containment measures introduced, we try to reconstruct the\nepidemic curve using all cause mortality data. Methods: we collected all cause\nmortality data stratified by age from the national institute of statistics,\ntogether with COVID-related deaths data released by other government\nstructures. Using a SEIR model together with estimates of the exposure to death\ntime distribution, we fitted the reproduction number in different phases of the\nspread at regional level.

While at\nthe early stages hyper-massive star-burst clusters reach the luminosities of\nquasars, once their massive stars die, the ensuing gas accretion from the still\nforming host galaxy compresses its stellar black hole (BH) component to a\ncompact state overcoming heating from the BH--BH binaries such that the cluster\ncollapses, forming a massive SMBH-seed within about a hundred Myr.

At 150 GHz, we remove the lensing\ndistortion with an effective efficiency of 30% (TT), 30% (EE), 26% (TE) and 20%\n(BB); this results in detections of the delensing effect at 8.7 sigma (TT), 5.1\nsigma (EE), 2.6 sigma (TE), and 2.4 sigma (BB) significance. The combination of\n150 and 98 GHz TT, EE, and TE delensed spectra is well fit by a standard LCDM\nmodel. We also measure the shift in best-fit parameters when fitting delensed\nversus lensed spectra; while this shift does not inform our ability to measure\ncosmological parameters, it does provide a three-way consistency check among\nthe lensing inferred from the best-fit parameters, the lensing in the CMB power\nspectrum, and the reconstructed lensing map. This shift is predicted to be zero\nwhen fitting with the correct model since both lensed and delensed spectra\noriginate from the same region of sky. Fitting with a LCDM model and\nmarginalizing over foregrounds, we find that the shift in cosmological\nparameters is consistent with zero.

We find an\nimportant excess of S0 galaxies in the DPS, not observed in the NBCS, and which\ncannot be accounted for by the environment, as most of these galaxies are\nisolated or in poor groups. Similarly, we find a relative deficit of pure discs\nin the DPS late-type galaxies, that are preferentially of Sa type. In parallel,\nwe observe a systematic central excess of star formation and extinction for DP\ngalaxies. Finally, there are noticeable differences in the kinematics: the gas\nvelocity dispersion is correlated with the galaxy inclination in the NBCS,\nwhereas this relation does not hold for the DPS. Furthermore, the DP galaxies\nshow larger stellar velocity dispersions and they deviate from the Tully-Fisher\nrelation for both late-type and S0 galaxies. These discrepancies can be\nreconciled if one considers the two peaks as two different components.\nConsidering the morphological biases in favour, bulge-dominated galaxies and\nstar-formation central enhancement, we suggest a scenario of multiple\nsequential minor mergers driving the increase of the bulge size, leading to\nlarger fractions of S0 galaxies and a deficit of pure disc galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 18:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

New chains are being implemented\nfrequently with different use cases in mind. As more and more types of crypto\nassets are getting real world value there is an increasing need for blockchain\ninteroperability. Exchange services today are still dominated by central\nparties which require custody of funds. This trust imposes costs and security\nrisks as frequent breaches testify. Atomic cross-chain swaps (ACCS) allow\nmutual distrusting parties to securely exchange crypto assets in a peer-to-peer\nmanner while preserving self-custody. Fundamental ACCS protocols leveraged the\nscripting capabilities of blockchains to conditionalize the transfer of funds\nbetween trading parties. Recent work showed that such protocols can be realized\nin a scriptless setting. This has many benefits to blockchains throughput,\nefficiency of swap protocols and also to fungibility and privacy. The proposed\nprotocols are limited to assets transferable by either Schnorr signatures or\nECDSA that are assuming the same elliptic curve parameters. In this work we\npresent JugglingSwap, a scriptless atomic cross-chain swap protocol with a\nhigher degree of interoperability. We weaken the assumptions about blockchains\nthat can be included in the ACCS protocol, and only require that (1) a\nthreshold variant exists to the underlying digital signature scheme and (2) it\nis based on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). The fair\nexchange is achieved by a gradual release of secrets. To achieve this we use a\nnew building block we call Juggling: a public key verifiable encryption scheme\nto transfer segments of secret shares between parties, which can also be of\nseparate interest. Juggling is then tailored to a specific private key\nmanagement system design with threshold signatures security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 18:16:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

This reconnection\nseems to be driven by photospheric shearing and converging flows around the\ninner two arcade footpoints, consistent with the flare-related changes of\ntransverse field. The southern portion of the filament rises upward due to\ntorus instability and pushes against the null point.

Case studies have previously been conducted on individual\ncommunities with respect to their scientific and social behavior. In this\nstudy, we introduce, a new and scalable community finding approach.\nSupplemented by expert assessment, we use the convergence of two different\nclustering methods to select article clusters generated from over two million\narticles from the field of immunology spanning an eleven year period with\nrelevant cluster quality indicators for evaluation. Finally, we identify author\ncommunities defined by these clusters. A sample of the article clusters\nproduced by this pipeline was reviewed by experts, and shows strong thematic\nrelatedness, suggesting that the inferred author communities may represent\nvalid communities of practice. These findings suggest that such convergent\napproaches may be useful in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 19:46:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

We adopt the\nAMD-stability criteria to constrain the orbital architectures for exoplanetary\nsystems. Previously, He, Ford, & Ragozzine (2019) (arXiv:1907.07773v2) showed\nthrough forward modelling (SysSim) that the observed multiplicity distribution\ncan be well reproduced by two populations consisting of a low and a high mutual\ninclination component. Here, we show that a broad distribution of mutual\ninclinations arising from systems at the AMD-stability limit can also match the\nobserved Kepler population. We show that distributing a planetary system's\nmaximum AMD amongst its planets results in a multiplicity-dependent\ndistribution of eccentricities and mutual inclinations. Systems with\nintrinsically more planets have lower median eccentricities and mutual\ninclinations, and this trend is well described by power-law functions of the\nintrinsic planet multiplicity ($n$): $\\tilde{\\mu}_{e,n} \\propto\nn^{-1.74_{-0.07}^{+0.11}}$ and $\\tilde{\\mu}_{i,n} \\propto\nn^{-1.73_{-0.08}^{+0.09}}$, where $\\tilde{\\mu}_{e,n}$ and $\\tilde{\\mu}_{i,n}$\nare the medians of the eccentricity and inclination distributions.

We\nshow that the observed preferences for planet size orderings and uniform\nspacings are more extreme than what can be produced by the detection biases of\nthe Kepler mission alone.

Each network sensor\nis characterized by a non-anomalous and anomalous distribution, governing the\ngeneration of sensor data. Initially, the observations of each sensor are\ngenerated according to the corresponding non-anomalous distribution. After some\nunknown but deterministic time instant, a moving anomaly emerges, affecting\ndifferent sets of sensors as time progresses. As a result, the observations of\nthe affected sensors are generated according to the corresponding anomalous\ndistribution. Our goal is to design a stopping procedure to detect the\nemergence of the anomaly as quickly as possible, subject to constraints on the\nfrequency of false alarms. The problem is studied in a quickest change\ndetection framework where it is assumed that the evolution of the anomaly is\nunknown but deterministic. To this end, we propose a modification of Lorden's\nworst average detection delay metric to account for the trajectory of the\nanomaly that maximizes the detection delay of a candidate detection procedure.\nWe establish that a Cumulative Sum-type test solves the resulting sequential\ndetection problem exactly when the sensors are homogeneous.

Recent machine learning techniques have the potential to\naddress this shortcoming, but existing approaches require vast amounts of\nnavigation experience for training, during which the robot must operate in\nclose proximity to obstacles and risk collision. In this paper, we propose to\nside-step this requirement by introducing a new machine learning paradigm for\nautonomous navigation called learning from hallucination (LfH), which can use\ntraining data collected in completely safe environments to compute navigation\ncontrollers that result in fast, smooth, and safe navigation in highly\nconstrained environments.

It is\nshown how the LHeC will open a new chapter of nuclear particle physics in\nextending the accessible kinematic range in lepton-nucleus scattering by\nseveral orders of magnitude. Due to enhanced luminosity, large energy and the\ncleanliness of the hadronic final states, the LHeC has a strong Higgs physics\nprogramme and its own discovery potential for new physics. Building on the 2012\nCDR, the report represents a detailed updated design of the energy recovery\nelectron linac (ERL) including new lattice, magnet, superconducting radio\nfrequency technology and further components. Challenges of energy recovery are\ndescribed and the lower energy, high current, 3-turn ERL facility, PERLE at\nOrsay, is presented which uses the LHeC characteristics serving as a\ndevelopment facility for the design and operation of the LHeC. An updated\ndetector design is presented corresponding to the acceptance, resolution and\ncalibration goals which arise from the Higgs and parton density function\nphysics programmes. The paper also presents novel results on the Future\nCircular Collider in electron-hadron mode, FCC-eh, which utilises the same ERL\ntechnology to further extend the reach of DIS to even higher centre-of-mass\nenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 21:17:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 21:27:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

Follow-up observations indicate that the planet is largely devoid of\nsubstantial atmosphere. This lack of significant atmosphere places\nastrophysical and geophysical constraints on LHS 3844b, primarily the degree of\nvolatile outgassing and the rate of atmosphere erosion.

We use geodynamical models of volcanic\noutgassing and atmospheric erosion to show that the apparent lack of atmosphere\nis consistent with a volatile-poor mantle for LHS 3844b. We show the core is\nunlikely to host enough C to produce a sufficiently volatile-poor mantle,\nunless the bulk planet is volatile-poor relative to Earth.

Atmospheric erosion by smaller impacts is possible,\nbut only if the planet has already begun degassing and is bombarded by $10^3$\nimpactors of radius 500-1000 km traveling at escape velocity. We discuss\nformation and migration scenarios that could account for a volatile poor\norigin, including the potential for an unobserved massive companion planet.

Both types of soliton have been observed in\nBEC, hydrodynamics, polaritons, and mode locked lasers, but have been\nparticularly relevant to the generation of chipscale microresonator-based\nfrequency combs (microcombs), used in numerous system level applications in\ntiming, spectroscopy, and communications. For microcombs, both bright solitons,\nand alternatively dark pulses based on interlocking switching waves, have been\nstudied. Yet, the existence of localized dissipative structures that fit\nbetween this dichotomy has been theoretically predicted, but proven\nexperimentally elusive. Here we report the discovery of dissipative structures\nthat embody a hybrid between switching waves and dissipative solitons, existing\nin the regime of (nearly) vanishing group velocity dispersion where third-order\ndispersion is dominant, hence termed as `zero-dispersion solitons'. These\ndissipative structures are formed via collapsing switching wave fronts, forming\nclusters of quantized solitonic sub-structures. The switching waves are formed\ndirectly via synchronous pulse-driving of a photonic chip-based Si3N4\nmicroresonator. The resulting frequency comb spectrum is extremely broad in\nboth the switching wave and zero-dispersion soliton regime, reaching 136 THz or\n97% of an octave. Fourth-order dispersion engineering results in\ndual-dispersive wave formation, and a novel quasi-phase matched wave related to\nFaraday instability.

More importantly,\neven less is known about why such models sometimes fail to train at all. In\nthis work, we aim to investigate these questions through the lens of the Neural\nTangent Kernel (NTK); a kernel that captures the behavior of fully-connected\nneural networks in the infinite width limit during training via gradient\ndescent.

Tip/tilt and phase\nsensing are currently performed in the $H$ (1.65 $\\mu$m) and $K$ (2.2 $\\mu$m)\nbands at 1 kHz, but only the $K$-band phase telemetry is used to send\ncorrections to the system in order to maintain fringe coherence and visibility.\nHowever, due to the cyclic nature of the fringe phase, only the phase, modulo\n360 deg, can be measured. PHASECam's phase unwrapping algorithm, which attempts\nto mitigate this issue, occasionally fails in the case of fast, large phase\nvariations or low signal-to-noise ratio.

The learnable parameterized structure brings more\nflexibility for MLR-SNet to learn a proper LR schedule to comply with the\ntraining dynamics of DNN. Image and text classification benchmark experiments\nsubstantiate the capability of our method for achieving proper LR schedules.\nMoreover, the explicit parameterized structure makes the meta-learned LR\nschedules capable of being transferable and plug-and-play, which can be easily\ngeneralized to new heterogeneous tasks. We transfer our meta-learned MLR-SNet\nto query tasks like different training epochs, network architectures, data\nmodalities, dataset sizes from the training ones, and achieve comparable or\neven better performance compared with hand-designed LR schedules specifically\ndesigned for the query tasks. The robustness of MLR-SNet is also substantiated\nwhen the training data are biased with corrupted noise. We further prove the\nconvergence of the SGD algorithm equipped with LR schedule produced by our\nMLR-Net, with the convergence rate comparable to the best-known ones of the\nalgorithm for solving the problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 01:18:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 01:21:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 15:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

This paper presents a disturbance rejection\napproach with two main improvements over existing results: 1) it relaxes the\nrequirement of calculating or measuring the state derivatives, which are not\navailable for measurement, and their calculation is corrupted by noise, and 2)\nit achieves finite-time disturbance rejection and control. To this end, the\ndisturbance is first modeled by an unknown dynamics, and an adaptive\ndisturbance observer is proposed to estimate it. A filtered regressor form is\nleveraged to model the nonlinear system and the unknown disturbance. It is\nshown that using this filtered regressor form, the disturbance is estimated\nusing only measured state of the regressor. That is, contrary to the existing\nresults on disturbance rejection, the presented approach does not require the\nstate derivative measurements. To improve the convergence speed of the\ndisturbance estimation, an adaptive law, equipped with experience replay, is\npresented. The disturbance observer is then augmented with an adaptive integral\nterminal sliding mode control to assure the finite-time convergence of tracking\nerror to zero. A verifiable rank condition on the history of the past\nexperience used by the experience-replay technique provides a sufficient\ncondition for convergence. Compared to the existing results, neither the\nknowledge of the disturbance dynamics nor the state derivatives are required,\nand finite-time stability is guaranteed.

The increased reliance on\nVA services raises privacy concerns such as the leakage of private\nconversations and sensitive information. Privacy policies play an important\nrole in addressing users' privacy concerns and informing them about the data\ncollection, storage, and sharing practices. VA platforms (both Amazon Alexa and\nGoogle Assistant) allow third-party developers to build new voice-apps and\npublish them to the app store. Voice-app developers are required to provide\nprivacy policies to disclose their apps' data practices. However, little is\nknown whether these privacy policies are informative and trustworthy or not on\nemerging VA platforms. On the other hand, many users invoke voice-apps through\nvoice and thus there exists a usability challenge for users to access these\nprivacy policies.

Most previous works on matrix completion focus on the low-rank\nproperty by imposing explicit constraints on the recovered matrix, such as the\nconstraint of the nuclear norm or limiting the dimension of the matrix\nfactorization component. Recently, theoretical works suggest that deep linear\nneural network has an implicit bias towards low rank on matrix completion.\nHowever, low rank is not adequate to reflect the intrinsic characteristics of a\nnatural image. Thus, algorithms with only the constraint of low rank are\ninsufficient to perform image restoration well.

In the basic IRKA, for the stable systems the Reduced Order Models\n(ROMs) can be found conveniently, but it is unsuitable for the unstable ones.\nIn the proposed technique, the initial feedback is implemented within the\nconstruction of the projectors of the IRKA approach. The solution of the\nRiccati equation is estimated from the ROM achieved by IRKA and hence the\nlow-rank feedback matrix is attained. Using the reverse projecting process, for\nthe full model the optimal feedback matrix is retrieved from the low-rank\nfeedback matrix.

Classification methods based on convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) are the state-of-the-art in maximizing inter-class differences\nin large medical imaging training datasets. The application of CNNs, to adrenal\nmasses is challenging due to large intra-class variations, large inter-class\nsimilarities and imbalanced training data due to the size of the mass lesions.\nWe developed a deep multi-scale resemblance network (DMRN) to overcome these\nlimitations and leveraged paired CNNs to evaluate the intra-class similarities.\nWe used multi-scale feature embedding to improve the inter-class separability\nby iteratively combining complementary information produced at different scales\nof the input to create structured feature descriptors.

This requires to extract value from two\nvery different types of natural-language information. The first is object\ndescription (e.g., 'table', 'door'), each presenting as a tip for the agent to\ndetermine the next action by finding the item visible in the environment, and\nthe second is action specification (e.g., 'go straight', 'turn left') which\nallows the robot to directly predict the next movements without relying on\nvisual perceptions. However, most existing methods pay few attention to\ndistinguish these information from each other during instruction encoding and\nmix together the matching between textual object/action encoding and visual\nperception/orientation features of candidate viewpoints. In this paper, we\npropose an Object-and-Action Aware Model (OAAM) that processes these two\ndifferent forms of natural language based instruction separately. This enables\neach process to match object-centered/action-centered instruction to their own\ncounterpart visual perception/action orientation flexibly. However, one\nside-issue caused by above solution is that an object mentioned in instructions\nmay be observed in the direction of two or more candidate viewpoints, thus the\nOAAM may not predict the viewpoint on the shortest path as the next action.

Here, we suggest that the tracking of prediction\nerror dynamics allows an artificial agent to be intrinsically motivated to seek\nnew experiences but constrained to those that generate reducible prediction\nerror.We present an intrinsic motivation architecture that generates behaviors\ntowards self-generated and dynamic goals and that regulates goal selection and\nthe balance between exploitation and exploration through multi-level monitoring\nof prediction error dynamics. This new architecture modulates exploration noise\nand leverages computational resources according to the dynamics of the overall\nperformance of the learning system. Additionally, it establishes a possible\nsolution to the temporal dynamics of goal selection. The results of the\nexperiments presented here suggest that this architecture outperforms intrinsic\nmotivation approaches where exploratory noise and goals are fixed and a greedy\nstrategy is applied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 06:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

Learning-based\ncontrollers are suitable for disturbance rejection control, but the excessive\ndisturbances heavily affect the state transition in Markov Decision Process\n(MDP) or Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Also, pure\nlearning procedures on targeted system may encounter damaging exploratory\nactions or unpredictable system variations, and training exclusively on a prior\nmodel usually cannot address model mismatch from the targeted system. In this\npaper, we propose a transfer learning framework that adapts a control policy\nfor excessive disturbance rejection of an underwater robot under dynamics model\nmismatch. A modular network of learning policies is applied, composed of a\nGeneralized Control Policy (GCP) and an Online Disturbance Identification Model\n(ODI). GCP is first trained over a wide array of disturbance waveforms. ODI\nthen learns to use past states and actions of the system to predict the\ndisturbance waveforms which are provided as input to GCP (along with the system\nstate). A transfer reinforcement learning algorithm using Transition Mismatch\nCompensation (TMC) is developed based on the modular architecture, that learns\nan additional compensatory policy through minimizing mismatch of transitions\npredicted by the two dynamics models of the source and target tasks.

Recent imaging spectroscopy observations allowed for the\nquantitative characterization of the drifting pairs in terms of source size,\nposition, and evolution. Here, the drift-pair parameters are qualitatively\nanalyzed and compared with the newly-developed Monte Carlo ray-tracing\ntechnique simulating radio-wave propagation in the inhomogeneous anisotropic\nturbulent solar corona. The results suggest that the drift-pair bursts can be\nformed due to a combination of the refraction and scattering processes, with\nthe trailing component being the result of turbulent reflection (turbulent\nradio echo). The formation of drift-pair bursts requires an anisotropic\nscattering with the level of plasma density fluctuations comparable to that in\ntype III bursts, but with a stronger anisotropy at the inner turbulence scale.\nThe anisotropic radio-wave scattering model can quantitatively reproduce the\nkey properties of drift-pair bursts: the apparent source size and its increase\nwith time at a given frequency, the parallel motion of the source centroid\npositions, and the delay between the burst components. The trailing component\nis found to be virtually co-spatial and following the main component. The\nsimulations suggest that the drift-pair bursts are likely to be observed closer\nto the disk center and below 100 MHz due to the effects of free-free absorption\nand scattering. The exciter of drift-pairs is consistent with propagating\npackets of whistlers, allowing for a fascinating way to diagnose the plasma\nturbulence and the radio emission mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 07:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

Due to non-uniqueness of a\nspecific slack reformulation suggested in [10], the relations are non-trivial.\nIt turns out that constraint qualifications of Abadie type are preserved. We\nalso prove the weaker result that equivalence of Guginard's (and Abadie's)\nconstraint qualifications for all branch problems hold, while the question of\nGCQ preservation remains open. Finally, we introduce M-stationarity and\nB-stationarity concepts for abs-normal NLPs and prove first order optimality\nconditions corresponding to MPCC counterpart formulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 07:58:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 13:02:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 13:46:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 11:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

End-to-end imitation learning is a\npopular method for computing self-driving car policies. The standard approach\nrelies on collecting pairs of inputs (camera images) and outputs (steering\nangle, etc.) from an expert policy and fitting a deep neural network to this\ndata to learn the driving policy. Although this approach had some successful\ndemonstrations in the past, learning a good policy might require a lot of\nsamples from the expert driver, which might be resource-consuming. In this\nwork, we develop a novel framework based on the Safe Dateset Aggregation (safe\nDAgger) approach, where the current learned policy is automatically segmented\ninto different trajectory classes, and the algorithm identifies trajectory\nsegments or classes with the weak performance at each step. Once the trajectory\nsegments with weak performance identified, the sampling algorithm focuses on\ncalling the expert policy only on these segments, which improves the\nconvergence rate. The presented simulation results show that the proposed\napproach can yield significantly better performance compared to the standard\nSafe DAgger algorithm while using the same amount of samples from the expert.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 08:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

The key lies in the design of\nthe graph structure, which encodes skeleton topology information. In this\npaper, we propose Dynamic GCN, in which a novel convolutional neural network\nnamed Contextencoding Network (CeN) is introduced to learn skeleton topology\nautomatically. In particular, when learning the dependency between two joints,\ncontextual features from the rest joints are incorporated in a global manner.\nCeN is extremely lightweight yet effective, and can be embedded into a graph\nconvolutional layer. By stacking multiple CeN-enabled graph convolutional\nlayers, we build Dynamic GCN. Notably, as a merit of CeN, dynamic graph\ntopologies are constructed for different input samples as well as graph\nconvolutional layers of various depths. Besides, three alternative context\nmodeling architectures are well explored, which may serve as a guideline for\nfuture research on graph topology learning.

Based on a hydrodynamic analogy to quantum mechanics, we furnish the\nunified gauge theory of all such models. In the light of this theory, currently\nknown methods are just a tip of the iceberg, and there exists an infinite\nfamily of yet unexplored trajectory-based approaches. Specifically, we show\nthat each definition for a semiclassical trajectory corresponds to a specific\nhydrodynamic analogy, where a quantum system is mapped to an effective\nprobability fluid in the phase space. We derive the continuity equation for the\neffective fluid representing dynamics of an arbitrary open bosonic many-body\nsystem.

A prediction in the original space is\ncomputed by solving a pre-image problem. In such an approach, the embedding,\nlinked to the target loss, is defined prior to the learning phase. In this\nwork, we propose to jointly learn a finite approximation of the output\nembedding and the regression function into the new feature space. For that\npurpose, we leverage a priori information on the outputs and also unexploited\nunsupervised output data, which are both often available in structured\nprediction problems. We prove that the resulting structured predictor is a\nconsistent estimator, and derive an excess risk bound.

We present the energy dependence of the QPO's frequency,\nrms, coherence and phase lag, and model them together with the time-averaged\nspectra. Our study shows that four components are required to fit all the\nspectra.

By fitting the lag spectrum, we find that the QPO in\ndiskbb leads CompTT-2 by 679 s, and CompTT-2 leads nthComp by 180 s.

The highest resolution simulation,\nShin-Uchuu, consists of 262 billion ($6400^3$) particles in a box of\nside-length 140 Mpc/h, with particle mass $8.97 \\times 10^{5}$ Msun/h.\nCombining these simulations we can follow the evolution of dark matter halos\nand subhalos spanning those hosting dwarf galaxies to massive galaxy clusters\nacross an unprecedented volume. In this first paper, we present basic\nstatistics, dark matter power spectra, and the halo and subhalo mass functions,\nwhich demonstrate the wide dynamic range and superb statistics of the Uchuu\nsuite. From an analysis of the evolution of the power spectra we conclude that\nour simulations remain accurate from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation scale down\nto the very small. We also provide parameters of a mass-concentration model,\nwhich describes the evolution of halo concentration and reproduces our\nsimulation data to within 5 per cent for halos with masses spanning nearly\neight orders of magnitude at redshift 0<z<14. There is an upturn in the\nmass-concentration relation for the population of all halos and of relaxed\nhalos at z>0.5, whereas no upturn is detected at z<0.5. We make publicly\navailable various $N$-body products as part of Uchuu Data Release 1 on the\nSkies & Universes site. Future releases will include gravitational lensing maps\nand mock galaxy, X-ray cluster, and active galactic nuclei catalogues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 10:12:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 04:05:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 10:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

However, the mechanism behind the\nphotocurrent generation in thin InSe photodetectors remains elusive. Here, we\npresent a set of experiments aimed at explaining the strong scattering in the\nphotoresponsivity values reported in the literature for thin InSe\nphotodetectors. By performing optoelectronic measurements on thin InSe-based\nphotodetectors operated under different environmental conditions we find that\nthe photoresponsivity, the response time and the photocurrent power dependency\nare strongly correlated in this material. This observation indicates that the\nphotogating effect plays an imporant role for thin InSe flakes, and it is the\ndominant mechanism in the ultra-high photoresponsivity of pristine InSe\ndevices. In addition, when exposing the pristine InSe photodetectors to the\nambient environment we observe a fast and irreversible change in the\nphotoresponse, with a decrease in the photoresponsivity accompanied by an\nincrease of the operating speed. We attribute this photodetector performance\nchange (upon atmospheric exposure) to the decrease in the density of the traps\npresent in InSe, due to the passivation of selenium vacancies by atmospheric\noxygen species. This passivation is accompanied by a downward shift of the InSe\nFermi level and by a decrease of the Fermi level pinning, which leads to an\nincrease of the Schottky barrier between Au and InSe. Our study reveals the\nimportant role of traps induced by defects in tailoring the properties of\ndevices based on 2D materials and offers a controllable route to design and\nfunctionalize thin InSe photodetectors to realize devices with either ultrahigh\nphotoresposivity or fast operation speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 10:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

In this paper, we propose two novel\nIRS-based passive information transmission systems using advanced symbol-level\nprecoding. One is a standalone passive information transmission system, where\nthe IRS operates as a passive transmitter serving multiple receivers by\nadjusting its elements to reflect unmodulated carrier signals. The other is a\njoint passive reflection and information transmission system, where the IRS not\nonly enhances transmissions for multiple primary information receivers (PIRs)\nby passive reflection, but also simultaneously delivers additional information\nto a secondary information receiver (SIR) by embedding its information into the\nprimary signals at the symbol level. Two typical optimization problems, i.e.,\npower minimization and quality-of-service (QoS) balancing, are investigated for\nthe proposed IRS-based passive information transmission systems.

Then we construct several classes of optimal\ncyclic $(r, \\delta)$-LRCs of length $n$ for $n\\, |\\, (q-1)$ or $n\\,|\\, (q+1)$,\nrespectively from the product of two sets of zeros. Our constructions include\nall optimal cyclic $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs proposed in \\cite{Chen2018,Chen2019}, and\nour method seems more convenient to obtain optimal cyclic $(r, \\delta)$-LRCs\nwith flexible parameters. Moreover, many optimal cyclic $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs of\nlength $n$ for $n\\, |\\, (q-1)$ or $n\\,|\\, (q+1)$, respectively such that\n$(r+\\delta-1)\\nmid n$ can be obtained from our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 11:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

We propose to\nlearn a parametric internal model for push interactions that, similar for\nhumans, enables a robot to predict the outcome of a physical interaction even\nin novel contexts. Given a desired push action, humans are capable to identify\nwhere to place their finger on a new object so to produce a predictable motion\nof the object. We achieve the same behaviour by factorising the learning into\ntwo parts. First, we learn a set of local contact models to represent the\ngeometrical relations between the robot pusher, the object, and the\nenvironment. Then we learn a set of parametric local motion models to predict\nhow these contacts change throughout a push. The set of contact and motion\nmodels represent our internal model. By adjusting the shapes of the\ndistributions over the physical parameters, we modify the internal model's\nresponse. Uniform distributions yield to coarse estimates when no information\nis available about the novel context (i.e. unbiased predictor). A more accurate\npredictor can be learned for a specific environment/object pair (e.g. low\nfriction/high mass), i.e. biased predictor. The effectiveness of our approach\nis shown in a simulated environment in which a Pioneer 3-DX robot needs to\npredict a push outcome for a novel object, and we provide a proof of concept on\na real robot. We train on 2 objects (a cube and a cylinder) for a total of\n24,000 pushes in various conditions, and test on 6 objects encompassing a\nvariety of shapes, sizes, and physical parameters for a total of 14,400\npredicted push outcomes.

In many applications of machine\nlearning such as learning-to-rank, decision forests deliver remarkable\nperformance. They also possess other coveted characteristics such as\ninterpretability. Despite their widespread use and rich history, decision\nforests to date fail to consume raw structured data such as text, or learn\neffective representations for them, a factor behind the success of deep neural\nnetworks in recent years. While there exist methods that construct smoothed\ndecision forests to achieve representation learning, the resulting models are\ndecision forests in name only: They are no longer axis-aligned, use stochastic\ndecisions, or are not interpretable. Furthermore, none of the existing methods\nare appropriate for problems that require a Transfer Learning treatment. In\nthis work, we present a novel but intuitive proposal to achieve representation\nlearning for decision forests without imposing new restrictions or\nnecessitating structural changes. Our model is simply a decision forest,\npossibly trained using any forest learning algorithm, atop a deep neural\nnetwork. By approximating the gradients of the decision forest through input\nperturbation, a purely analytical procedure, the decision forest directs the\nneural network to learn or fine-tune representations.

In these\ncircumstances, we wish to apply an affirmative action policy to reduce\nacceptance rate disparities, while avoiding any large decrease in the aptitude\nof the candidates that are eventually selected. Our algorithmic design is\nmotivated by the frequently observed phenomenon that discrimination\ndisproportionately affects individuals who simultaneously belong to multiple\ndisadvantaged groups, defined along intersecting dimensions such as gender,\nrace, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, and disability. In short, our\nalgorithm's objective is to simultaneously: select candidates with high\nutility, and level up the representation of disadvantaged intersectional\nclasses.

To combat this pandemic, effective screening techniques\nfor infected patients are indispensable. There is no doubt that the use of\nchest X-ray images for radiological assessment is one of the essential\nscreening techniques. Some of the early studies revealed that the patient's\nchest X-ray images showed abnormalities, which is natural for patients infected\nwith COVID-19. In this paper, we proposed a parallel-dilated convolutional\nneural network (CNN) based COVID-19 detection system from chest x-ray images,\nnamed as Parallel-Dilated COVIDNet (PDCOVIDNet). First, the publicly available\nchest X-ray collection fully preloaded and enhanced, and then classified by the\nproposed method. Differing convolution dilation rate in a parallel form\ndemonstrates the proof-of-principle for using PDCOVIDNet to extract\nradiological features for COVID-19 detection. Accordingly, we have assisted our\nmethod with two visualization methods, which are specifically designed to\nincrease understanding of the key components associated with COVID-19\ninfection. Both visualization methods compute gradients for a given image\ncategory related to feature maps of the last convolutional layer to create a\nclass-discriminative region. In our experiment, we used a total of 2,905 chest\nX-ray images, comprising three cases (such as COVID-19, normal, and viral\npneumonia), and empirical evaluations revealed that the proposed method\nextracted more significant features expeditiously related to the suspected\ndisease. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method\nsignificantly improves performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1\nscores reach 96.58%, 96.58%, 96.59%, and 96.58%, respectively, which is\ncomparable or enhanced compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 12:28:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

These materials could\nreplace dyes in some applications because the color is tunable and resists\nphotobleaching. However, designing nanostructures with a prescribed color is\ndifficult, especially when the application -- cosmetics or displays, for\nexample -- requires specific component materials. A general approach to solving\nthis constrained design problem is modeling and optimization: using a model\nthat predicts the color of a given system, one optimizes the model parameters\nunder constraints to achieve a target color. For this approach to work, the\nmodel must make accurate predictions, which is challenging because disordered\nnanostructures have multiple scattering. To address this challenge, we develop\na Monte Carlo model that simulates multiple scattering of light in disordered\narrangements of spherical particles or voids. The model produces quantitative\nagreement with measurements when we account for roughness on the surface of the\nfilm, particle polydispersity, and wavelength-dependent absorption in the\ncomponents. Unlike discrete numerical simulations, our model is parameterized\nin terms of experimental variables, simplifying the connection between\nsimulation and fabrication. To demonstrate this approach, we reproduce the\ncolor of the male mountain bluebird (Sialia currucoides) in an experimental\nsystem, using prescribed components and a microstructure that is easy to\nfabricate. Finally, we use the model to find the limits of angle-independent\nstructural colors for a given system.

The mission will exploit a unique region of the\nparameter space, between the narrow ultra-deep surveys with HST and JWST, and\nshallow wide-field surveys such as Roman Space Telescope and EUCLID, and should\nyield by far the largest sample of any current or planned mission of very high\nredshift galaxies at z > 10 which are sufficiently bright for detailed\nfollow-up spectroscopy.

From an application point of\nview, while the multirhythmicity is sometimes desirable as it presents us with\nmany possible coexisting stable oscillatory states to tap into, it can also be\na nuisance because a random perturbation may make the system settle onto an\nunwanted stable state. Consequently, it is not surprising that there are many\nnatural and artificial mechanisms available that can control the\nmultirhythmicity. We propose in this paper the idea of incorporating parametric\n(periodic) modulation of the nonlinear damping in the limit cycle oscillators\nwith a view to exciting resonance and antiresonance responses at particular\nangular driving frequencies, and controlling the resulting birhythmicity by\nchanging the amplitude of the modulation. To this end, we employ analytical\n(perturbative) and numerical techniques on the van der Pol oscillator---a\nparadigmatic limit cycle system---having additional position dependent time\ndelay term and its modified autonomous birhythmic version. We also bring the\nfact to the fore that introduction of delay---a commonly adopted method of\ncontrolling multirhythmicity---in such a system can sometimes bring forth\nunwanted birhythmicity; and interestingly, our method of controlling\nbirhythmicity through periodic modulation can suppress such a delay induced\nbirhythmic response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 14:59:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 21:52:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

This geometry is motivated by experimental observations\nof cerebrospinal fluid flow along perivascular spaces (PVSs) surrounding\narteries in the brain, which is at least partially driven by peristaltic\npumping. These PVSs are well matched, in cross-section, by an adjustable model\nconsisting of an inner circle (arterial wall) and an outer ellipse (outer edge\nof the PVS), not necessarily concentric. We use this model, which may have\nother applications, as a basis for numerical simulations of peristaltic flow.\nWe use a finite-element scheme to compute the flow driven by a propagating\nsinusoidal radial displacement of the inner wall. Unlike peristaltic flow in a\nconcentric circular annulus, the flow is fully three-dimensional, with\nstreamlines wiggling in both the radial and axial directions. We examine the\ndependence of the flow on the elongation of the outer elliptical wall and on\nthe eccentricity of the configuration.

Although this hypothesis provides an explanation for the\norigin of close-in planets, it also encounter predicament on the retention of\nlong-period orbits for most gas giant planets. Moreover, numerical simulations\nindicate that planets migrations are not solely determined by the viscous\ndiffusion of their natal disk.

Instead of testing\nnasal swab or blood samples from individual persons, we propose to test\nmixtures of samples from many individuals. The pooled sample testing method\nproposed in this paper also serves a different purpose: for increasing test\nreliability and providing accurate diagnoses even if the tests themselves are\nnot very accurate. Our method uses ideas from compressed sensing and\nerror-correction coding to correct for a certain number of errors in the test\nresults. The intuition is that when each individual's sample is part of many\npooled sample mixtures, the test results from all of the sample mixtures\ncontain redundant information about each individual's diagnosis, which can be\nexploited to automatically correct for wrong test results in exactly the same\nway that error correction codes correct errors introduced in noisy\ncommunication channels. While such redundancy can also be achieved by simply\ntesting each individual's sample multiple times, we present simulations and\ntheoretical arguments that show that our method is significantly more efficient\nin increasing diagnostic accuracy. In contrast to group testing and compressed\nsensing which aim to reduce the number of required tests, this proposed error\ncorrection code idea purposefully uses pooled testing to increase test\naccuracy, and works not only in the \"undersampling\" regime, but also in the\n\"oversampling\" regime, where the number of tests is bigger than the number of\nsubjects. The results in this paper run against traditional beliefs that, \"even\nthough pooled testing increased test capacity, pooled testings were less\nreliable than testing individuals separately.\"\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 15:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

The geyser-like plume at Saturn's moon Enceladus was\ndiscovered in part as a result of UV stellar occultation observations, and this\ntechnique was used to characterize the plume and jets during the entire Cassini\nmission.

At other moons and small bodies throughout the solar system, UV\nspectroscopy has been utilized to search for activity, probe surface\ncomposition, and delineate space weathering effects; UV photometric studies\nhave been used to uncover regolith structure. Insights from UV imaging\nspectroscopy of solar system surfaces have been gained largely in the last 1-2\ndecades, including studies of surface composition, space weathering effects\n(e.g. radiolytic products) and volatiles on asteroids (e.g.\n[2][39][48][76][84]), the Moon (e.g. [30][46][49]), comet nuclei (e.g. [85])\nand icy satellites (e.g. [38][41-44][45][47][65]).

We aim to obtain the first thermal-noise limited (~ 1.5 mJy/beam)\ndeep continuum radio map using the LOFAR Low Band Antenna (LBA) system. Our\ndemonstration observation targeted the galaxy cluster RX J0603.3+4214 (the\n\"Toothbrush\" cluster). We used the resulting ultra-low frequency (58 MHz) image\nto study cosmic-ray acceleration and evolution in the post shock region, as\nwell as their relation with the presence of a radio halo. We describe the data\nreduction we have used to calibrate LOFAR LBA observations. The resulting image\nis combined with observations at higher frequencies (LOFAR 150 MHz and VLA 1500\nMHz) to extract spectral information. We obtained the first thermal-noise\nlimited image from an observation carried out with the LOFAR LBA system using\nall Dutch stations at a central frequency of 58 MHz. With 8 hours of data, we\nreached an rms noise of 1.3 mJy/beam at a resolution of 18\" x 11\". The\nprocedure we have developed is an important step forward towards routine\nhigh-fidelity imaging with the LOFAR LBA. The analysis of the radio spectra\nshows that the radio relic extends to distances of 800 kpc downstream from the\nshock front, larger than what allowed by electron cooling time. Furthermore,\nthe shock wave started accelerating electrons already at a projected distance\nof <300 kpc from the crossing point of the two clusters. These results can be\nexplained if electrons are reaccelerated downstream by background turbulence\npossibly combined with projection effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 13:58:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 14:48:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

We find that increasing the thickness of the dipolar\nhole-blocking layer results in a gradual increase in the open-circuit voltage\nsuggesting that aggregation of the molecules can enhance the dipole induced by\nthe layer. This finding is confirmed by theoretical calculations demonstrating\nthat while both molecules exhibit a similar dipole moment in their isolated\nstate, this dipole is significantly enhanced when they aggregate. Ultra-violet\nphotoemission spectroscopy measurements show that both derivatives exhibit a\nhigh ionisation potential of 7 eV, in agreement with their effective\nhole-blocking nature demonstrated by the devices. However, each of the\nmolecules shows a different electron affinity due to the increased conjugation\nof one of the derivatives. While the change in electron transport level between\nthe two derivatives is as high as 0.3 eV, the difference in the open-circuit\nvoltage of both types of devices is negligible, suggesting that the electron\ntransport level plays only a minor role in determining the open-circuit voltage\nof the device.

The main objectives\nare to explore whether a hybrid approach (crop modeling + ML) would result in\nbetter predictions, investigate which combinations of hybrid models provide the\nmost accurate predictions, and determine the features from the crop modeling\nthat are most effective to be integrated with ML for corn yield prediction.\nFive ML models (linear regression, LASSO, LightGBM, random forest, and XGBoost)\nand six ensemble models have been designed to address the research question.\nThe results suggest that adding simulation crop model variables (APSIM) as\ninput features to ML models can decrease yield prediction root mean squared\nerror (RMSE) from 7 to 20%. Furthermore, we investigated partial inclusion of\nAPSIM features in the ML prediction models and we found soil moisture related\nAPSIM variables are most influential on the ML predictions followed by\ncrop-related and phenology-related variables. Finally, based on feature\nimportance measure, it has been observed that simulated APSIM average drought\nstress and average water table depth during the growing season are the most\nimportant APSIM inputs to ML.

To illustrate the underlying mechanism of our ML-ACO\nalgorithm, we start by describing a test problem, the orienteering problem. In\nthis problem, the objective is to find a route that visits a subset of vertices\nin a graph within a time budget to maximize the collected score. In the first\nphase of our ML-ACO algorithm, an ML model is trained using a set of small\nproblem instances where the optimal solution is known. Specifically,\nclassification models are used to classify an edge as being part of the optimal\nroute, or not, using problem-specific features and statistical measures. The\ntrained model is then used to predict the probability that an edge in the graph\nof a test problem instance belongs to the corresponding optimal route. In the\nsecond phase, we incorporate the predicted probabilities into the ACO component\nof our algorithm, i.e., using the probability values as heuristic weights or to\nwarm start the pheromone matrix. Here, the probability values bias sampling\ntowards favoring those predicted high-quality edges when constructing feasible\nroutes. We have tested multiple classification models including graph neural\nnetworks, logistic regression and support vector machines, and the experimental\nresults show that our solution prediction approach consistently boosts the\nperformance of ACO. Further, we empirically show that our ML model trained on\nsmall synthetic instances generalizes well to large synthetic and real-world\ninstances. Our approach integrating ML with a meta-heuristic is generic and can\nbe applied to a wide range of optimization problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 13:03:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 05:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

However, the success of conventional machine learning\ntools in data science is primarily attributed to the unprecedented large amount\nof labeled data-sets (big data), which can be either obtained by experiments or\nfirst-principle simulations. Unfortunately, these labeled data-sets are\nexpensive to obtain in AM due to the high expense of the AM experiments and\nprohibitive computational cost of high-fidelity simulations.\n  We propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that fuses both\ndata and first physical principles, including conservation laws of momentum,\nmass, and energy, into the neural network to inform the learning processes. To\nthe best knowledge of the authors, this is the first application of PINN to\nthree dimensional AM processes modeling.
