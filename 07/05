In this paper, we\nconsider policy optimization in Markov Decision Problems, where the objective\nis a general concave utility function of the state-action occupancy measure,\nwhich subsumes several of the aforementioned examples as special cases. Such\ngenerality invalidates the Bellman equation. As this means that dynamic\nprogramming no longer works, we focus on direct policy search. Analogously to\nthe Policy Gradient Theorem \\cite{sutton2000policy} available for RL with\ncumulative rewards, we derive a new Variational Policy Gradient Theorem for RL\nwith general utilities, which establishes that the parametrized policy gradient\nmay be obtained as the solution of a stochastic saddle point problem involving\nthe Fenchel dual of the utility function. We develop a variational Monte Carlo\ngradient estimation algorithm to compute the policy gradient based on sample\npaths. We prove that the variational policy gradient scheme converges globally\nto the optimal policy for the general objective, though the optimization\nproblem is nonconvex. We also establish its rate of convergence of the order\n$O(1/t)$ by exploiting the hidden convexity of the problem, and proves that it\nconverges exponentially when the problem admits hidden strong convexity. Our\nanalysis applies to the standard RL problem with cumulative rewards as a\nspecial case, in which case our result improves the available convergence rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 17:51:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

The EOS blockchain platform for\ndeveloping smart contract and decentralized applications (DAPPs) aims to\naddress the scalability problem found in existing blockchain platforms. This\nsmart contract platform aims to eliminate transaction fees while conducting\nmillions of transactions per second. In our proposed approach, the EOS\nblockchain transparently stores RBAC policies. Administrative roles control\naccess to resources at a higher level according to the way organisations\nperform operations. An organisation creates roles, role hierarchies and\nconstraints to regulate user actions. Therefore, once an RBAC framework is\nestablished, the administrative user (issuer) only needs to grant and revoke\nroles to support changes in the organisational structure.

Collisions are resolved in localized regions\nto minimize the number of optimization variables even when the number of\nsimulated objects is high. We further accelerate implicit differentiation of\noptimization with nonlinear constraints. Experiments demonstrate that the\npresented framework requires up to two orders of magnitude less memory and\ncomputation in comparison to recent particle-based methods. We further validate\nthe approach on inverse problems and control scenarios, where it outperforms\nderivative-free and model-free baselines by at least an order of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 19:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

Thus, having a system that automatically\ndetects COVID-19 in tomography (CT) images can assist in quantifying the\nseverity of the illness. Unfortunately, labelling chest CT scans requires\nsignificant domain expertise, time, and effort. We address these labelling\nchallenges by only requiring point annotations, a single pixel for each\ninfected region on a CT image. This labeling scheme allows annotators to label\na pixel in a likely infected region, only taking 1-3 seconds, as opposed to\n10-15 seconds to segment a region.

In the MuLE configuration, an LE mirror is divided\ninto several segments and the X-rays reflected on each of these segments are\nfocused on a single image sensor in a multiplexed configuration. If each LE\nsegment assumes a different rotation angle, the azimuthal rotation angle of a\ncross-like image reconstructed from a point source by the LE optics identifies\nthe specific segment that focuses the X-rays on the imager. With a focal length\nof 30 cm and LE segments with areas of 10 x 10 cm^2, ~1 sr of the sky can be\ncovered with 36 LE segments and only four imagers (with total areas of 10 x 10\ncm^2).

During each iteration, a projection function, which embodies\nthe optimal objective value of a lower-level power grid projected onto its\nboundary variable space, is computed with second-order exactness. Thus, the\nproposed method can be applied widely to nonlinear continuous optimizations and\ncan converge much more rapidly than existing decomposition methods.

The binary coincidences at a relative angle of\n180$^0$ deg. correspond to binary fission or to the decay into three cluster\nfragments by registration of two nuclei with different masses\n(e.g.$^{132}$Sn,$^{52-48}$Ca,$^{68-72}$Ni). This marks a new step in the\nphysics of fission-phenomena of heavy nuclei. These experimental results for\nthe collinear cluster tripartition (CCT), refer to the decay into three\nclusters of comparable masses. In the present work we discuss the various\naspects of this ternary fission (FFF) mode. The question of collinearity is\nanalysed on the basis of recent publications. Further insight into the possible\ndecay modes is obtained by the discussion of the path towards larger\ndeformation, towards hyper-deformation and by inspecting details of the\npotential energy surfaces (PES). In the path towards the extremely deformed\nstates leading to ternary fission, the concept of deformed shells is most\nimportant. At the scission configuration the phase space determined by the\nPES's leads to the final mass distributions. The possibility of formation of\nfragments of almost equal size ($Z_i$ = 32, 34, 32, for $Z$=98) and the\nobservation of several other fission modes in the same system can be predicted\nby the PES. The PES's show pronounced minima and valleys, namely for several\nmass/charge combinations of ternary fragments, which correspond to a variety of\ncollinear ternary fission (multi-modal) decays. The case of the decay of\n$^{252}$Cf(sf,fff) turns out to be unique due to the presence of deformed\nshells in the total system and of closed shells in all three nuclei in the\ndecay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 03:21:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

To answer this question, we train and compare the\naccuracy of various SOTA object detection networks on the PlotQA dataset. At\nthe standard IOU setting of 0.5, most networks perform well with mAP scores\ngreater than 80% in detecting the relatively simple objects in plots. However,\nthe performance drops drastically when evaluated at a stricter IOU of 0.9 with\nthe best model giving a mAP of 35.70%. Note that such a stricter evaluation is\nessential when dealing with scientific plots where even minor localisation\nerrors can lead to large errors in downstream numerical inferences. Given this\npoor performance, we propose minor modifications to existing models by\ncombining ideas from different object detection networks. While this\nsignificantly improves the performance, there are still 2 main issues: (i)\nperformance on text objects which are essential for reasoning is very poor, and\n(ii) inference time is unacceptably large considering the simplicity of plots.\nTo solve this open problem, we make a series of contributions: (a) an efficient\nregion proposal method based on Laplacian edge detectors, (b) a feature\nrepresentation of region proposals that includes neighbouring information, (c)\na linking component to join multiple region proposals for detecting longer\ntextual objects, and (d) a custom loss function that combines a smooth L1-loss\nwith an IOU-based loss.

Simultaneously, our\nmodel is very efficient with an inference time 16x lesser than the current\nmodels, including one-stage detectors. With these contributions, we enable\nfurther exploration on the automated reasoning of plots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 05:30:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 07:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

Such models can neither be\nstraightforwardly transferred to other domains nor generalize well, and\ncreating labeled training data for new domains is expensive and laborious. The\nneed for paraphrasing across different domains and the scarcity of labeled\ntraining data in many such domains call for exploring unsupervised paraphrase\ngeneration methods. We propose Progressive Unsupervised Paraphrasing (PUP): a\nnovel unsupervised paraphrase generation method based on deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL).

Our extensive\nexperimental evaluation shows that PUP outperforms unsupervised\nstate-of-the-art paraphrasing techniques in terms of both automatic metrics and\nuser studies on four real datasets.

Recently, supervised machine learning\napproaches have been used for this problem, and they have had reasonable\nsuccess. In particular, state-of-the-art methods such as Convolutional Neural\nNetworks automatically extract increasingly complex feature hierarchies from\nthe image pixels. While such generalized automatic feature extraction methods\nhave significantly reduced the burden of feature engineering in many domains,\nfor niche tasks such as the one we consider in this paper, they result in two\nmajor problems. First, they use a very large number of features (that may or\nmay not be relevant) and therefore training such models is computationally\nexpensive. Further, more importantly, the large feature-space makes it very\nhard to interpret which features are truly important for predictions. Thus, a\ncriticism of such methods is that learning algorithms pose opaque black boxes\nto its users, in this case, medical experts. The recommendation of such\nalgorithms can be understood easily, but the reason for their recommendation is\nnot clear. This is the problem of non-interpretability of the model, and the\nbest-performing algorithms are usually the least interpretable.

For the\nhalf-space, the method, though yielding, an elegant analytical form resulting\nfrom half-range completeness, requires numerical evaluation of complicated\nintegrals.

In the proof, we give a geometric interpretation\nof $(G,N)$-commutator lengths.\n  As an application of our Bavard duality, we obtain a sufficient condition on\na pair $(G,N)$ under which $\\mathrm{scl}_G$ and $\\mathrm{scl}_{G,N}$ are\nbi-Lipschitzly equivalent on $[G,N]$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 07:38:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 13:34:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 05:00:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 11:19:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

For this\ndataset, MPA-Net outperforms the neural image assessment algorithm, which was\nregarded as a baseline method. In particular, MPA-Net yields a 0.073 (11.5%)\nhigher linear correlation coefficient (LCC) of aesthetics scores and a 0.088\n(14.4%) higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC).

Built-up area\nestimation is an important component in understanding the human impact on the\nenvironment, the effect of public policy, and general urban population\nanalysis. The diverse nature of aerial and satellite imagery and lack of\nlabeled data covering this diversity makes machine learning algorithms\ndifficult to generalize for such tasks, especially across multiple domains. On\nthe other hand, due to the lack of strong spatial context and structure, in\ncomparison to the ground imagery, the application of existing unsupervised\ndomain adaptation methods results in the sub-optimal adaptation. We thoroughly\nstudy the limitations of existing domain adaptation methods and propose a\nweakly-supervised adaptation strategy where we assume image-level labels are\navailable for the target domain. More specifically, we design a built-up area\nsegmentation network (as encoder-decoder), with an image classification head\nadded to guide the adaptation. The devised system is able to address the\nproblem of visual differences in multiple satellite and aerial imagery\ndatasets, ranging from high resolution (HR) to very high resolution (VHR). A\nrealistic and challenging HR dataset is created by hand-tagging the 73.4 sq-km\nof Rwanda, capturing a variety of build-up structures over different terrain.\nThe developed dataset is spatially rich compared to existing datasets and\ncovers diverse built-up scenarios including built-up areas in forests and\ndeserts, mud houses, tin, and colored rooftops.

To start, we reformulate tiling\nas a graph problem by modeling candidate tile locations in the target shape as\ngraph nodes and connectivity between tile locations as edges. Further, we build\na graph convolutional neural network, coined TilinGNN, to progressively\npropagate and aggregate features over graph edges and predict tile placements.\nTilinGNN is trained by maximizing the tiling coverage on target shapes, while\navoiding overlaps and holes between the tiles. Importantly, our network is\nself-supervised, as we articulate these criteria as loss terms defined on the\nnetwork outputs, without the need of ground-truth tiling solutions. After\ntraining, the runtime of TilinGNN is roughly linear to the number of candidate\ntile locations, significantly outperforming traditional combinatorial search.\nWe conducted various experiments on a variety of shapes to showcase the speed\nand versatility of TilinGNN.

The main properties of\nthis model, primarily aimed at exploring basic phenomena of interest for space\nplasmas such as the solar wind, are its ability to provide a reasonable\nagreement with kinetic theory for linear low-frequency modes, and at the same\ntime to ensure a Hamiltonian structure in the absence of explicit dissipation.\nThe model accounts for equilibrium temperature anisotropy, ion and electron\nfinite Larmor radius corrections, electron inertia, magnetic fluctuations along\nthe direction of a strong guide field, and parallel Landau damping. Remarkably,\nthe quasi-static closure leads to exact expressions for the nonlinear terms\ninvolving gyroaveraged electromagnetic perturbations. One of the consequences\nis that a rather natural identification of the Hamiltonian structure of the\nmodel becomes possible when Landau damping is neglected. A slight variant of\nthe model consists of a four-field Hamiltonian reduction of the original\nsix-field model, which we use for the subsequent linear analysis. In the\nlatter, the dispersion relations of kinetic Alfv\\'en waves and the firehose\ninstability are shown to be correctly reproduced, relatively far in the sub-ion\nrange (depending on the plasma parameters), while the spectral range where the\nslow-wave dispersion relation and the field-swelling instabilities are\nprecisely described is less extended. This loss of accuracy originates from the\nbreaking of the condition of small phase velocity, relative to the parallel\nthermal velocity of the electrons (for kinetic Alfv\\'en waves and firehose\ninstability) or of the ions (in the case of the field-swelling instabilities).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 10:59:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Thus, attackers\nutilize a scripting engine in target programs like a web browser to prepare the\ncode-reuse chain, e.g., relocate gadget addresses or perform a just-in-time\ngadget search. However, many types of programs do not provide such an execution\ncontext that an attacker can use. Recent advances in data-oriented programming\n(DOP) explored an orthogonal way to abuse memory corruption vulnerabilities and\ndemonstrated that an attacker can achieve Turing-complete computations without\nmodifying code pointers in applications. As of now, constructing DOP exploits\nrequires a lot of manual work.\n  In this paper, we present novel techniques to automate the process of\ngenerating DOP exploits. We implemented a compiler called Steroids that\ncompiles our high-level language SLANG into low-level DOP data structures\ndriving malicious computations at run time. This enables an attacker to specify\nher intent in an application- and vulnerability-independent manner to maximize\nreusability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques and prototype\nimplementation by specifying four programs of varying complexity in SLANG that\ncalculate the Levenshtein distance, traverse a pointer chain to steal a private\nkey, relocate a ROP chain, and perform a JIT-ROP attack. Steroids compiles each\nof those programs to low-level DOP data structures targeted at five different\napplications including GStreamer, Wireshark, and ProFTPd, which have vastly\ndifferent vulnerabilities and DOP instances.

However, latency caused by hundreds to\nthousands of communication rounds remains a bottleneck in FL. To minimize the\ntraining latency, this work provides a multi-armed bandit-based framework for\nonline client scheduling (CS) in FL without knowing wireless channel state\ninformation and statistical characteristics of clients. Firstly, we propose a\nCS algorithm based on the upper confidence bound policy (CS-UCB) for ideal\nscenarios where local datasets of clients are independent and identically\ndistributed (i.i.d.) and balanced.

This contribution proposes\na method to improve the computational performance of orbit propagators through\nan efficient numerical integration that meets the accuracy requirements set by\nthe specific application. This is achieved by appropriately tuning the\nparameters of the numerical propagator (relative tolerance and maximum time\nstep), establishing a threshold for the perturbing accelerations (Earth's\ngravitational potential, atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, third-body\nperturbations, relativistic correction to gravity) below which they can be\nneglected without altering the quality of the results and implementing an\nefficient and precise algorithm for the harmonic synthesis of the geo-potential\nand its first-order gradient. In particular, when performing the harmonic\nsynthesis, the number of spherical harmonics to retain (i.e., the expansion\ndegree) is determined by the accuracy requirement. Given that higher-order\nharmonics decay rapidly with altitude, the expansion degree necessary to meet\nthe target accuracy decreases with height. To improve the computational\nefficiency, the number of degrees to retain is determined dynamically while the\ntrajectory is being computed. The optimum expansion degree for each altitude is\ndetermined by ensuring that the truncation error of the harmonic synthesis is\nbelow the threshold acceleration. The work is a generalization to arbitrary\norbits of a previous study that focused on communication satellites in\ngeosynchronous inclined orbits.

The other more restricted universal codes still work for\nlarge classes of natural channels. In a universal code, encoding is\nchannel-independent, but the decoding function knows the type of channel. We\nallow the encoding and the decoding functions to share randomness, which is\nunavailable to the channel. There are two scenarios for the type of attack that\na channel can perform. In the oblivious scenario, codewords belong to an\nadditive group and the channel distorts a codeword by adding a vector from a\nfixed set. The selection is based on the message and the encoding function, but\nnot on the codeword. In the Hamming scenario, the channel knows the codeword\nand is fully adversarial. For a universal code, there are two parameters of\ninterest: the rate, which is the ratio between the message length k and the\ncodeword length n, and the number of shared random bits. We show the existence\nin both scenarios of universal codes with rate 1-t/n - o(1), which is optimal\nmodulo the o(1) term.

With the rapid\ndevelopment of the Internet, consumers usually seek health information\nincluding dietary supplement information online.

However, as information in\niDISK was collected from scientific sources, the complex medical jargon is a\nbarrier for consumers' comprehension. To assess how different approaches to\nsimplify and represent dietary supplement information from iDISK will affect\nlay consumers' comprehension, using a crowdsourcing platform, we recruited\nparticipants to read dietary supplement information in four different\nrepresentations from iDISK: original text, syntactic and lexical text\nsimplification, manual text simplification, and a graph-based visualization. We\nthen assessed how the different simplification and representation strategies\naffected consumers' comprehension of dietary supplement information in terms of\naccuracy and response time to a set of comprehension questions. With responses\nfrom 690 qualified participants, our experiments confirmed that the manual\napproach had the best performance for both accuracy and response time to the\ncomprehension questions, while the graph-based approach ranked the second\noutperforming other representations. In some cases, the graph-based\nrepresentation outperformed the manual approach in terms of response time.

The proposed MMA\nexhibits a strong absorptivity above 90\\% in the widest incident angle up to\n$87^\\circ$ for TM- and TE- polarized oblique incidences for THz wave\npropagating in yoz-plane. According to simulation results, under normal\nincidence, when VO2 films are in the insulating state, the proposed absorber\nexhibits high absorptivity in the frequency band of 1-4 THz. By increasing the\ntemperature of the whole structure, the structural transformation of VO2 occurs\nand turns into the metallic phase. We have shown that under oblique incidence,\nthe ohmic losses of VO2 films especially those parallel to the direction of the\nincident electric field are the most important absorption principles of the\nproposed MMA. Furthermore, to understand the physical mechanism of absorption,\nthe induced electric field as well as the power loss density of the proposed\nstructure are investigated. In addition, it is shown that the presented VO2\nbased honeycomb absorber retains its full-coverage incident angle\ncharacteristics for TM-polarized incidences propagating in the xoz-plane. Due\nto the ultra wide-angle absorption (angular stability) and mechanical\nperformance, it is expected that the presented MMA may find potential\napplications, such as camouflage technologies, electromagnetic interference,\nimaging, and sensing. To the best knowledge of authors, the proposed MMA\nconfiguration exhibits the absorptivity in the widest incident angle ever\nreported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 14:12:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

HD is characterized by absence of ganglion cells in\nthe distal intestinal tract with a gradual normalization of ganglion cell\nnumbers in adjacent upstream bowel, termed as the transition zone (TZ).\nDefinitive surgical management to remove the abnormal bowel requires accurate\nassessment of ganglion cell density in histological sections from the TZ, which\nis difficult, time-consuming and prone to operator error. We present an\nautomated method to detect and count immunostained ganglion cells using a new\nNABLA_N network based deep learning (DL) approach, called GanglionNet. The\nmorphological image analysis methods are applied for refinement of the regions\nfor counting of the cells and define ganglia regions (a set of ganglion cells)\nfrom the predicted masks. The proposed model is trained with single point\nannotated samples by the expert pathologist. The GanglionNet is tested on ten\ncompletely new High Power Field (HPF) images with dimension of 2560x1920 pixels\nand the outputs are compared against the manual counting results by the expert\npathologist. The proposed method shows a robust 97.49% detection accuracy for\nganglion cells, when compared to counts by the expert pathologist, which\ndemonstrates the robustness of GanglionNet. The proposed DL based ganglion cell\ndetection and counting method will simplify and standardize TZ diagnosis for HD\npatients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 15:46:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

The\napproach here differs from previous studies, since in the generative process\nSwampland criteria are used and, only later, the results of the fit are\nvalidated, by using observational data-sets. A generative process based\nBayesian Learning approach is applied to two models and the results are\nvalidated by means of available $H(z)$ data. For the first model, a\nparametrization of the Hubble constant is considered and, for the second, a\nparametrization of the deceleration parameter. This study is motivated by a\nrecent work, where constraints on string Swampland criteria have been obtained\nfrom a Gaussian Process and $H(z)$ data. However, the results obtained here are\nfully independent of the observational data and allow to estimate how the\nhigh-redshift behavior of the Universe will affect the low-redshift one.\nMoreover, both parameterizations in the generative process, for the Hubble and\nfor the deceleration parameters, are independent of the dark energy model. The\noutcome, both data- and dark energy model-independent, may highlight, in the\nfuture, the borders of the Swampland for the low-redshift Universe and help to\ndevelop new string-theory motivated dark-energy models. The string Swampland\ncriteria considered might be in tension with recent observations indicating\nthat phantom dark energy cannot be in the Swampland. Finally, a spontaneous\nsign switch in the dark energy equation of state parameter is observed when the\nfield traverses are in the $z\\in[0,5]$ redshift range, a remarkable phenomenon\nrequiring further analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 15:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Computer vision and\ndeep learning techniques can assist in determining COVID-19 infection with\nChest X-ray Images. However, for the protection and respect of the privacy of\npatients, the hospital's specific medical-related data did not allow leakage\nand sharing without permission. Collecting such training data was a major\nchallenge. To a certain extent, this has caused a lack of sufficient data\nsamples when performing deep learning approaches to detect COVID-19. Federated\nLearning is an available way to address this issue. It can effectively address\nthe issue of data silos and get a shared model without obtaining local data. In\nthe work, we propose the use of federated learning for COVID-19 data training\nand deploy experiments to verify the effectiveness. And we also compare\nperformances of four popular models (MobileNet, ResNet18, MoblieNet, and\nCOVID-Net) with the federated learning framework and without the framework.\nThis work aims to inspire more researches on federated learning about COVID-19.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 08:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

To address these, we seek to exploit rich\nlabeled data from relevant domains to help the learning in the target task via\n{Unsupervised Domain Adaptation} (UDA). Unlike most UDA methods that rely on\nclean labeled data or assume samples are equally transferable, we innovatively\npropose a Collaborative Unsupervised Domain Adaptation algorithm, which\nconducts transferability-aware adaptation and conquers label noise in a\ncollaborative way.

The proposed model exploits the\nspatio-temporal multivariate multidimensional historical weather data for\nlearning new representations used for wind forecasting.

First, a unique architecture is\nproposed that harvests energy from an access point (AP) without the receiver\nneeding a splitter. In the proposed system model, a portion of the spectrum is\nused for information decoding (ID) while the remaining portion is exploited for\nenergy harvesting (EH) in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access\n(OFDMA) network. To investigate the performance gain, an optimization problem\nis formulated that maximizes the harvested energy of a multi-user single-cell\nOFDMA downlink (DL) network with SWIPT and also satisfies a minimum data-rate\nrequirement for all users. A locally optimal solution for the underlying\nproblem, which is essentially non-convex due to the coupling of the integer\nvariable, is obtained by using optimization tools. Second, the proposed system\nmodel is improved in order to investigate the resource allocation problem of\nneeding to maximize throughput based on the separated receiver architecture in\nan OFDMA multi-user multi-cell system that uses SWIPT. The resulting problem,\nwhich jointly optimizes the subcarrier assignment and power allocation, is a\nmixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP) that is difficult to solve. Third, a\nstate-of-the-art harvesting technique at the receiver that is based on receiver\nantenna selection with a co-located architecture is explored to optimize the\nenergy efficiency (EE) of a SWIPT-enabled multi-cell multi-user OFDMA network.\nThis is referred to as a Generalized Antenna-Switching Technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 18:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

By\nexamining the death rates of Canada in general and Quebec, Ontario and Alberta\nin particular, one can easily figured out that there are substantial\noverdispersion relative to the Poisson so that the negative binomial\ndistribution is an appropriate choice for the analysis. Generalized additive\nmodels (GAMs) are one of the main modeling tools for data analysis.
