Most\nnonreciprocal devices today are made from a special class of low-loss ferrites\nthat exhibit a magneto-optical response in the presence of an external static\nmagnetic field. While breaking transmission symmetry, ferrites fail to satisfy\nthe need for miniaturization of photonic circuitry due to weak character of\nnonreciprocal responses at optical wavelengths and are not easy to integrate\ninto on-chip photonic systems. These challenges led to the emergence of\nmagnetic-free approaches relying on breaking time reversal symmetry, e.g. with\nnonlinear effects modulating optical system in time. Here, we demonstrate an\nall-optical approach to nonreciprocity based on nonlinear valley-selective\nresponse in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). This approach overcomes\nthe limitations of magnetic materials and it does not require an external\nmagnetic field. We provide experimental evidence of photoinduced nonreciprocity\nin a monolayer WS2 pumped by circularly polarized light. Nonreciprocity stems\nfrom valley-selective exciton-exciton interactions, giving rise to nonlinear\ncircular dichroism controlled by circularly polarized pump fields. Our\nexperimental results reveal a significant effect even at room temperature,\ndespite considerable intervalley-scattering, showing potential for practical\napplications in magnetic-free nonreciprocal platforms. As an example, we\npropose a device scheme to realize an optical isolator based on a pass-through\nsilicon nitride (SiN) ring resonator integrating the optically biased TMD\nmonolayer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 16:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

To generate high-quality text, popular decoding algorithms\nlike top-k, top-p (nucleus), and temperature-based sampling truncate or distort\nthe unreliable low probability tail of the language model. Though these methods\ngenerate high-quality text after parameter tuning, they are ad hoc. Not much is\nknown about the control they provide over the statistics of the output, which\nis important since recent reports show text quality is highest for a specific\nrange of likelihoods. Here, first we provide a theoretical analysis of\nperplexity in top-k, top-p, and temperature sampling, finding that\ncross-entropy behaves approximately linearly as a function of p in top-p\nsampling whereas it is a nonlinear function of k in top-k sampling, under\nZipfian statistics. We use this analysis to design a feedback-based adaptive\ntop-k text decoding algorithm called mirostat that generates text (of any\nlength) with a predetermined value of perplexity, and thereby high-quality text\nwithout any tuning. Experiments show that for low values of k and p in top-k\nand top-p sampling, perplexity drops significantly with generated text length,\nwhich is also correlated with excessive repetitions in the text (the boredom\ntrap). On the other hand, for large values of k and p, we find that perplexity\nincreases with generated text length, which is correlated with incoherence in\nthe text (confusion trap). Mirostat avoids both traps: experiments show that\ncross-entropy has a near-linear relation with repetition in generated text.\nThis relation is almost independent of the sampling method but slightly\ndependent on the model used. Hence, for a given language model, control over\nperplexity also gives control over repetitions. Experiments with human raters\nfor fluency, coherence, and quality further verify our findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 17:22:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 21:36:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-18"}

We develop a coarse-grained\nlattice model, the Arrow-Potts model, to explore the physics behind this\ncompetition. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the model showcases non-monotonic\nTTT diagrams resulting in polycrystalline structures, with two distinct regimes\nlimited by either crystal nucleation or growth. At high temperatures,\ncrystallization is limited by nucleation and results in the growth of compact\ncrystal grains. At low temperatures, crystal growth is influenced by glassy\ndynamics, and proceeds through dynamically heterogeneous and hierarchical\nrelaxation pathways producing fractal and ramified crystals. To explain these\nphenomena, we combine the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami theory with the field\ntheory of nucleation, a random walk theory for crystal growth, and the\ndynamical facilitation theory for glassy dynamics. The unified theory yields an\nanalytical formula relating crystallization timescale to the nucleation and\ngrowth rates through universal exponents governing glassy dynamics of the\nmodel. We show that the formula with the universal exponents yields excellent\nagreement with the Monte Carlo simulation data and thus, it also accounts for\nthe non-monotonic TTT diagrams produced by the model.

Firstly, the quantum\nnumbers of the $S_3$ allow for a renormalisable diquark operator that would\ntrigger rapid proton decay unless its coupling were tuned away. Secondly, one\nexpects the leptoquark to have generic couplings to leptons, which require\ntuning to avoid stringent experimental bounds on lepton flavour violation. By\ngauging a $U(1)$ current that acts as $L_\\mu - L_\\tau$ on the Standard Model\n(SM) fermions, and under which the leptoquark has charge $-1$, one can remedy\nboth these problems.

Because\nquantum geometric effects become progressively more important with stronger\npairing attraction, a full understanding of 2D multi-orbital superconductivity\nrequires the incorporation of preformed pairs. We find it is through the\neffective mass of these pairs that quantum geometry enters the theory and this\nsuggests that the quantum geometric effects are present in the\nnon-superconducting pseudogap phase as well. Increasing these geometric\ncontributions tends to raise $T_{\\mathrm{BKT}}$ which then competes with\nfluctuation effects that generally depress it. We argue that a way to\nphysically quantify the magnitude of these geometric terms is in terms of the\nratio of the pairing onset temperature $T^*$ to $T_{\\mathrm{BKT}}$. Our paper\ncalls attention to an experimental study demonstrating how both temperatures\nand, thus, their ratio may be currently accessible. They can be extracted from\nthe same voltage-current measurements which are generally used to establish BKT\nphysics. We use these observations to provide rough preliminary estimates of\nthe magnitude of the geometric contributions in, for example, magic angle\ntwisted bilayer graphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 18:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 17:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-06"}

When the variable represents a count, the literature dealing\nwith this issue is scarce. Likewise, if problems of over- or under-dispersion\nare observed, generalisations of the Poisson distribution are recommended for\ncarrying out imputation. In order to assess the performance of various\nregression models in the imputation of a discrete variable compared to\nclassical counting models, this work presents a comprehensive simulation study\nconsidering a variety of scenarios and real data. To do so we compared the\nresults of estimations using only complete data, and using imputations based on\nthe Poisson, negative binomial, Hermite, and COMPoisson distributions, and the\nZIP and ZINB models for excesses of zeros. The results of this work reveal that\nthe COMPoisson distribution provides in general better results in any\ndispersion scenario, especially when the amount of missing information is\nlarge. When the variable presenting missing values is a count, the most widely\nused method is to assume that a classical Poisson model is the best alternative\nto impute the missing counts; however, in real-life research this assumption is\nnot always correct, and it is common to find count variables exhibiting\noverdispersion or underdispersion, for which the Poisson model is no longer the\nbest to use in imputation. In several of the scenarios considered the\nperformance of the methods analysed differs, something which indicates that it\nis important to analyse dispersion and the possible presence of excess zeros\nbefore deciding on the imputation method to use. The COMPoisson model performs\nwell as it is flexible regarding the handling of counts with characteristics of\nover- and under-dispersion, as well as with equidispersion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 18:02:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-31"}

Optimizing aperiodic cellular structural systems\nthus presents high-dimensional problems that are challenging to solve using\npurely high-fidelity structural optimization approaches. Specialized analytical\nmodeling along with metamodel based optimization can provide a more tractable\nalternative solution approach. To this end, this paper presents a design\nautomation framework applied to a 1D metamaterial system, namely a drill\nstring, where vibration suppression is of utmost importance. The drill string\ncomprises a set of nonuniform rings attached to the outer surface of a\nlongitudinal rod. As such, the resultant system can now be perceived as an\naperiodic 1D metamaterial with each ring/gap representing a cell. Despite being\na 1D system, the simultaneous consideration of multiple DoF (i.e., torsional,\naxial, and lateral motions) poses significant computational challenges.\nTherefore, a transfer matrix method (TMM) is employed to analytically determine\nthe frequency response of the drill string. A suite of neural networks (ANN) is\ntrained on TMM samples (which present minute-scale computing costs per\nevaluation), to model the frequency response. ANN-based optimization is then\nperformed to minimize mass subject to constraints on the gap between\nconsecutive resonance peaks in one case, and minimizing this gap in the second\ncase, leading to crucial improvements over baselines. Further novel\ncontribution occurs through the development of an inverse modeling approach\nthat can instantaneously produce the 1D metamaterial design with minimum mass\nfor a given desired non-resonant frequency range. This is accomplished by using\ninvertible neural networks, and results show promising alignment with forward\nsolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 18:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-31"}

All\nthese models are derived from microscopic quantum description. The derivation\nis made within the many-particle quantum hydrodynamics method suggested by L.\nKuz'menkov. The derivation is demonstrated and discussed for the mean-field\nregime revealing the Gross-Pitaevskii equation as the simplest illustration. It\nappears in the first order by the interaction radius. Generalization of the\nhydrodynamic Euler equation obtained in the third order by the interaction\nradius are discussed. It includes the contribution of the isotropic short-range\ninteraction presented by the third space derivative of the square of\nconcentration. The Euler equation also includes the contribution of the\nanisotropic part of the short-range interaction proportional to the second\norder spherical function. Systematic account of the quantum fluctuations in\nterms of the many-particle quantum hydrodynamics method requires the extension\nof the set of hydrodynamic equations from the couple continuity and Euler\nequations to the set of four equations which also includes the pressure\nevolution equation and the evolution equation for the third rank analog of\npressure. The pressure evolution equation contains no interaction contribution\nin the first order by the interaction radius. The source of the quantum\nfluctuations is in the interaction caused term in the third rank tensor\nevolution equation which is obtained in the first order by the interaction\nradius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 18:30:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

However, if we have access to observational and\ninterventional data, it is possible to solve that task. If X is causing Y, then\nit does not matter if we observe an effect in Y by observing changes in X or by\nintervening actively on X. This invariance principle creates a link between\nobservational and interventional distributions in a higher dimensional\nprobability space. We embed distributions that originate from samples of X and\nY into that higher dimensional space such that the embedded distribution is\nclosest to the distributions that follow the invariance principle, with respect\nto the relative entropy. This allows us to calculate the best\ninformation-theoretic approximation for a given empirical distribution, that\nfollows an assumed underlying causal model. We show that this\ninformation-theoretic approximation to causal models (IACM) can be done by\nsolving a linear optimization problem. In particular, by approximating the\nempirical distribution to a monotonic causal model, we can calculate\nprobabilities of causation. We can also use IACM for causal discovery problems\nin the bivariate, discrete case. However, experimental results on labeled\nsynthetic data from additive noise models show that our causal discovery\napproach is lagging behind state-of-the-art approaches because the invariance\nprinciple encodes only a necessary condition for causal relations.\nNevertheless, for synthetic multiplicative noise data and real-world data, our\napproach can compete in some cases with alternative methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 18:34:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-16"}

Based on a two by\ntwo framework of self-regulated learning, students with a performance-avoidance\noriented goal are more likely to guess on some of the assessment attempts in\norder to save time, resulting in an underestimation of the student populations'\ntransfer ability. The current analysis shows that about half of the students\nhad frequent brief initial assessment attempts, and significantly lower correct\nrates on certain modules, which we think is likely to have originated at least\nin part from students adopting a performance-avoidance strategy.

Periodic\nsurface homeomorphisms can be described (up to conjugacy) by using data sets\nwhich are combinatorial objects. In this article, we start by associating a\nrational open book to a slight modification of a given data set, called marked\ndata set. It is known that every rational open book supports a contact\nstructure. Thus, we can associate a contact structure to a periodic map and\nstudy the properties of it in terms combinatorial conditions on marked data\nsets.\n  In particular, we prove that a class of data sets, satisfying easy-to-check\ncombinatorial hypothesis, gives rise to Stein fillable contact structures. In\naddition to the above, we prove an analogue of Mori's construction of explicit\nsymplectic filling for rational open books. We also prove a sufficient\ncondition for Stein fillability of rational open books analogous to the\npositivity of monodromy in honest open books as in the result of Giroux and\nLoi-Piergallini.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 19:14:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 06:09:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 07:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-08"}

The goal of database expansion,\ntogether with a robust deep learning classifier, is to diminish wrong labels\ndue to the incomplete or not found nature of relation instances in the relation\ndatabase (e.g., Freebase). The study uses a deep learning method (Piecewise\nConvolutional Neural Network or PCNN) as the base classifier of our proposed\napproach: the leveled adversarial attention neural networks (LATTADV-ATT). In\nthe database expansion process, the semantic entity identification is used to\nenlarge new instances using the most similar itemsets of the most common\npatterns of the data to get its pairs of entities. About the deep learning\nmethod, the use of attention of selective sentences in PCNN can reduce noisy\nsentences.

The shape of the corresponding flux tube\ncross section and how it varies with position are especially important\nproperties. They are a direct indication of the expansion of the field and of\nthe cross-field spatial distribution of the heating. We have studied 20 loops\nusing high spatial resolution observations from the first flight of the Hi-C\nrocket experiment, measuring the intensity and width as a function of position\nalong the loop axis. We find that intensity and width tend to either be\nuncorrelated or to have a direct dependence, such that they increase or\ndecrease together. This implies that the flux tube cross sections are\napproximately circular under the assumptions that the tubes have non-negligible\ntwist and that the plasma emissivity is approximately uniform along the\nmagnetic field. The shape need not be a perfect circle and the emissivity need\nnot be uniform within the cross section, but sub-resolution patches of emission\nmust be distributed quasi-uniformly within an envelope that has an aspect ratio\nof order unity. This raises questions about the suggestion that flux tubes\nexpand with height, but primarily in the line-of-sight direction so that the\ncorresponding (relatively noticeable) loops appear to have roughly uniform\nwidth, a long-standing puzzle. It also casts doubt on the idea that most loops\ncorrespond to simple warped sheets, although we leave open the possibility of\nmore complex manifold structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 20:13:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-31"}

Gravitational wave emission in our model has\ntwo key features: low-frequency emission (< 200 Hz) emanates from the gain\nlayer as a result of neutrino-driven convection and the SASI and high-frequency\nemission (> 600 Hz) emanates from the proto-neutron star due to Ledoux\nconvection within it. The high-frequency emission dominates the gravitational\nwave emission in our model and emanates largely from the convective layer\nitself, not from the convectively stable layer above it, due to convective\novershoot. Moreover, the low-frequency emission emanates from the gain layer\nitself, not from the proto-neutron star, due to accretion onto it. We provide\nevidence of the SASI in our model and demonstrate that the peak of our\nlow-frequency gravitational wave emission spectrum corresponds to it. Given its\norigin in the gain layer, we classify the SASI emission in our model as p-mode\nemission and assign a purely acoustic origin, not a vortical-acoustic origin,\nto it. Our dominant proto-neutron star gravitational wave emission is not well\ncharacterized by emission from surface g-modes, complicating the relationship\nbetween peak frequencies observed and the mass and radius of the proto-neutron\nstar expressed by analytic estimates under the assumption of surface g-mode\nemission.

In the recently proposed\nnarrowband IoT (NB-IoT) standard, which trades off bandwidth to gain wide\ncoverage, the location estimation is compounded by the low sampling rate\nreceivers and limited-capacity links. We address both of these NB-IoT drawbacks\nin the framework of passive sensing devices that receive signals from the\ntarget-of-interest. We consider the limiting case where each node receiver\nemploys one-bit analog-to-digital-converters and propose a novel low-complexity\nnodal delay estimation method using constrained-weighted least squares\nminimization. To support the low-capacity links to the fusion center (FC), the\nrange estimates obtained at individual sensors are then converted to one-bit\ndata. At the FC, we propose target localization with the aggregated one-bit\nrange vector using both optimal and sub-optimal techniques.

As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 21:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-23"}

Typical\nsolutions include dividing input images into patches of fixed size and/or\ndown-sampling to meet memory constraints. Such operations incur information\nloss in the field-of-view (FoV) i.e., spatial coverage and the image\nresolution. The impact on segmentation performance is, however, as yet\nunderstudied. In this work, we start with a motivational experiment which\ndemonstrates that the trade-off between FoV and resolution affects the\nsegmentation performance on ultra-high resolution images---and furthermore, its\ninfluence also varies spatially according to the local patterns in different\nareas. We then introduce foveation module, a learnable \"dataloader\" which, for\na given ultra-high resolution image, adaptively chooses the appropriate\nconfiguration (FoV/resolution trade-off) of the input patch to feed to the\ndownstream segmentation model at each spatial location of the image. The\nfoveation module is jointly trained with the segmentation network to maximise\nthe task performance. We demonstrate on three publicly available\nhigh-resolution image datasets that the foveation module consistently improves\nsegmentation performance over the cases trained with patches of fixed\nFoV/resolution trade-off.

In 3DGS, the form of the\nstructure and its equilibrium of forces is represented by two polyhedral\ndiagrams that are geometrically and topologically related. The areas of the\nfaces of the force diagram represent the magnitude of the internal and external\nforces in the system. For the first time, the methods of this research allow\nthe user to control and constrain the areas and edge lengths of the faces of\ngeneral polyhedrons that can be convex, self-intersecting, or concave. As a\nresult, a designer can explicitly control the force magnitudes in the force\ndiagram and explore the equilibrium of a variety of compression and\ntension-combined funicular structural forms. In this method, a quadratic\nformulation is used to compute the area of a single face based on its edge\nlengths. The approach is applied to manipulating the face geometry with a\npredefined area and the edge lengths. Subsequently, the geometry of the\npolyhedron is updated with newly changed faces. This approach is a multi-step\nalgorithm where each step includes computing the geometry of a single face and\nupdating the polyhedral geometry. One of the unique results of this framework\nis the construction of the zero-area, self-intersecting faces, where the sum of\nthe signed areas of a self-intersecting face is zero, representing a member\nwith zero force in the form diagram. The methodology of this research can\nclarify the equilibrium of some systems that could not be previously justified\nusing reciprocal polyhedral diagrams. Therefore, it generalizes the principle\nof the equilibrium of polyhedral frames and opens a completely new horizon in\nthe design of highly-sophisticated funicular polyhedral structures beyond\ncompression-only systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 22:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-31"}

Their\ncross-domain success, however, is often achieved at the expense of\ncomputational cost, high memory bandwidth, and long inference latency, which\nprevents their deployment in resource-constrained and time-sensitive scenarios,\nsuch as edge-side inference and self-driving cars. While recently developed\nmethods for creating efficient deep neural networks are making their real-world\ndeployment more feasible by reducing model size, they do not fully exploit\ninput properties on a per-instance basis to maximize computational efficiency\nand task accuracy. In particular, most existing methods typically use a\none-size-fits-all approach that identically processes all inputs. Motivated by\nthe fact that different images require different feature embeddings to be\naccurately classified, we propose a fully dynamic paradigm that imparts deep\nconvolutional neural networks with hierarchical inference dynamics at the level\nof layers and individual convolutional filters/channels. Two compact networks,\ncalled Layer-Net (L-Net) and Channel-Net (C-Net), predict on a per-instance\nbasis which layers or filters/channels are redundant and therefore should be\nskipped. L-Net and C-Net also learn how to scale retained computation outputs\nto maximize task accuracy. By integrating L-Net and C-Net into a joint design\nframework, called LC-Net, we consistently outperform state-of-the-art dynamic\nframeworks with respect to both efficiency and classification accuracy. On the\nCIFAR-10 dataset, LC-Net results in up to 11.9$\\times$ fewer floating-point\noperations (FLOPs) and up to 3.3% higher accuracy compared to other dynamic\ninference methods.

This paper uses the open-source Python-based Energy Planning\n(PyEPLAN) tool, developed for the design of sustainable MGs in remote areas, on\nthe Alderney island, the 3$^{rd}$ largest of the Channel Islands with a\npopulation of about 2000 people. A two-stage stochastic model is used to\noptimally invest in battery storage, solar power, and wind power units.\nMoreover, the AC power flow equations are modelled by a linearised version of\nthe DistFlow model in PyEPLAN, where the investment variables are here-and-now\ndecisions and not a function of uncertain parameters while the operation\nvariables are wait-and-see decisions and a function of uncertain parameters.\nThe $k$-means clustering technique is used to generate a set of best\n(risk-seeker), nominal (risk-neutral), and worst (risk-averse) scenarios\ncapturing the uncertainty spectrum using the yearly historical patterns of load\ndemands and solar/wind power generations.

It is known that all BICs turn to resonant states with finite\nquality factors if the periodic structure is perturbed by a generic\nperturbation breaking the $C_2$ symmetry, and a typical BIC continues to exist\nif the perturbation keeps the $C_2$ symmetry.

However, labeled data may only be available abundantly in a domain\ndifferent from the desired target domain, which only has minimal or no\nannotations. In this work, we propose a novel framework for domain adaptation\nin semantic segmentation with image-level weak labels in the target domain. The\nweak labels may be obtained based on a model prediction for unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA), or from a human annotator in a new weakly-supervised domain\nadaptation (WDA) paradigm for semantic segmentation. Using weak labels is both\npractical and useful, since (i) collecting image-level target annotations is\ncomparably cheap in WDA and incurs no cost in UDA, and (ii) it opens the\nopportunity for category-wise domain alignment.

To address this, we introduce a\nnotion of algorithmic stability and study it in the context of fair and\nefficient allocations of indivisible goods among two agents. We show that it is\nimpossible to achieve exact stability along with even a weak notion of fairness\nand even approximate efficiency. As a result, we propose two relaxations to\nstability, namely, approximate-stability and weak-approximate-stability, and\nshow how existing algorithms in the fair division literature that guarantee\nfair and efficient outcomes perform poorly with respect to these relaxations.\nThis leads us to explore the possibility of designing new algorithms that are\nmore stable. Towards this end, we present a general characterization result for\npairwise maximin share allocations, and in turn use it to design an algorithm\nthat is approximately-stable and guarantees a pairwise maximin share and Pareto\noptimal allocation for two agents. Finally, we present a simple framework that\ncan be used to modify existing fair and efficient algorithms in order to ensure\nthat they also achieve weak-approximate-stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 03:09:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 15:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

First, a\ncomprehensive introduction to the subjects of stochastic processes, information\ntheory and the theory of stochastic thermodynamics is given, thereby\nhighlighting the key results.\n  In the second part, systems with interacting degrees of freedom are\nconsidered. This allows investigation of thermalization properties of\ncollisional baths, i.e. particles at equilibrium interacting with a localized\nsystem via collisions. It is shown that the interactions between system and\nbath must be reversible to ensure thermalization of the system. Moreover, the\nrole of information in thermodynamics is presented and interpreted in the\ncontext of interacting systems. Using the concept of causal conditioning, a\nframework is developed for finding entropy productions that capture the mutual\ninfluence of coupled subsystems. This framework is applied to diverse setups\nwhich are usually studied separately in information thermodynamics.\n  The third part covers the case of important system variables being hidden\nfrom observation. The problem is motivated by presenting a microswimmer model\nand showing that its movement can be approximated by active Brownian motion.\nHowever, its energy dissipation is massively underestimated by this procedure.\nIt is shown that this is a consequence of the fact that the swimming mechanism\nis a hidden variable. Subsequently, different methods of effective description\nare discussed and applied to a simple model system with which the impact of\nhidden slow degrees of freedom on fluctuation theorems is studied.

In this\npaper, we introduce a new IFR strategy, namely Search for Boundary (SB), to\nidentify an approximate failure region of a numeric input domain. SB attempts\nto identify additional failure-causing inputs that are as close to the boundary\nof the failure region as possible. To support SB, we provide a basic procedure,\nand then propose two methods, namely Fixed-orientation Search for Boundary\n(FSB) and Diverse-orientation Search for Boundary (DSB). In addition, we\nimplemented an automated experimentation platform to integrate these methods.\nIn the experiments, we evaluated the proposed SB methods using a series of\nsimulation studies andempirical studies with different types of failure\nregions. The results show that our methods can effectively identify a failure\nregion, within the limited testing resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 05:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-31"}

The\npristine antiferromagnetic (AFM) MnTe shows only a magnon-induced peak in the\nheat capacity near the Neel temperature, TN~307K. However, Cr-doped MnTe shows\na magnon-contributed heat capacity peak at ~293K with an additional peak in the\ndeep paramagnetic domain near 780K. Temperature-dependent magnetic\nsusceptibility reveals that Cr-doping initially creates low-spin (LS) states\nMn2+ ions into MnTe near and below TN due to a higher crystal field induced by\nCr ions. Above 400K, LS Mn2+ ions start converting into high-spin (HS) Mn2+\nions. The LS-to-HS transition of Mn2+ leads to an excess entropy and hence\nexcess heat capacity contribution in the system. Temperature-dependent X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) and magnetic field-dependent susceptibility (M-H) confirmed\nno presence of any structural changes and magnetic polaron, respectively. Both\nXRD and M-H ensure that the peak of the heat capacity in the paramagnetic\ndomain is originated solely by the spin-state transition. The heat capacity\nversus temperature was calculated to explain the contribution of each\ncomponent, including the ones due to the phonons, magnons, spin-transition,\nSchottky anomaly, and lattice dilation.

Devising techniques to\nensure IP protection has become necessary due to the increasing trend of\noutsourcing the DNN computations on the untrusted accelerators in cloud-based\nservices. The design methodologies and hyper-parameters of DNNs are crucial\ninformation, and leaking them may cause massive economic loss to the\norganization. Furthermore, the knowledge of DNN's architecture can increase the\nsuccess probability of an adversarial attack where an adversary perturbs the\ninputs and alter the prediction.\n  In this work, we devise a two-stage attack methodology \"DeepPeep\" which\nexploits the distinctive characteristics of design methodologies to\nreverse-engineer the architecture of building blocks in compact DNNs. We show\nthe efficacy of \"DeepPeep\" on P100 and P4000 GPUs. Additionally, we propose\nintelligent design maneuvering strategies for thwarting IP theft through the\nDeepPeep attack and proposed \"Secure MobileNet-V1\". Interestingly, compared to\nvanilla MobileNet-V1, secure MobileNet-V1 provides a significant reduction in\ninference latency ($\\approx$60%) and improvement in predictive performance\n($\\approx$2%) with very-low memory and computation overheads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 06:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-31"}

Quantum teleportation is an\nintrinsically quantum phenomenon, and was first introduced by teleporting an\nunknown quantum state via dual classical and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen channels\nin 1993. In this paper, we consider the possibility of applying this quantum\ntechnique to autonomous mobile classical platforms for control and autonomy\npurposes for the first time in this research. First, a review of how Quantum\nEntanglement and Quantum Cryptography can be integrated into macroscopic\nmechanical systems for controls and autonomy applications is presented, as well\nas how quantum teleportation concepts may be applied to the classical domain.\nIn quantum teleportation, an entangled pair of photons which are correlated in\ntheir polarizations are generated and sent to two autonomous platforms, which\nwe call the Alice Robot and the Bob Robot. Alice has been given a quantum\nsystem, i.e. a photon, prepared in an unknown state, in addition to receiving\nan entangled photon. Alice measures the state of her entangled photon and her\nunknown state jointly and sends the information through a classical channel to\nBob. Although Alice original unknown state is collapsed in the process of\nmeasuring the state of the entangled photon (due to the quantum non-cloning\nphenomenon), Bob can construct an accurate replica of Alice state by applying a\nunitary operator.

The size of a\nsmallest determining set for $G$ is called its determining number, $Det(G)$. A\ngraph $G$ is said to be $d$-distinguishable if there is a coloring of the\nvertices with $d$ colors so that only the trivial automorphism preserves the\ncolor classes. The smallest such $d$ is the distinguishing number, $Dist(G)$.\nIf $Dist(G) = 2$, the cost of 2-distinguishing, $\\rho(G)$, is the size of a\nsmallest color class over all 2-distinguishing colorings of $G$. The\nMycielskian, $\\mu(G)$, of a graph $G$ is constructed by adding a shadow master\nvertex $w$, and for each vertex $v_i$ of $G$ adding a shadow vertex $u_i$ with\nedges so that the neighborhood of $u_i$ in $\\mu(G)$ is the same as the\nneighborhood of $v_i$ in $G$ with the addition of $w$. That is,\n$N(u_i)=N_G(v_i)\\cup\\{w\\}$. The generalized Mycielskian $\\mu^{(t)}(G)$ of a\ngraph $G$ is a Mycielskian graph with $t$ layers of shadow vertices, each with\nedges to layers above and below, and $w$ only adjacent to the top layer of\nshadow vertices. A graph is twin-free if it has no pair of vertices with the\nsame set of neighbors. This paper examines the determining number and, when\nrelevant, the cost of 2-distinguishing for Mycielskians and generalized\nMycielskians of simple graphs with no isolated vertices. In particular, if $G\n\\neq K_2$ is twin-free with no isolated vertices, then $Det(\\mu^{(t)}(G)) =\nDet(G)$. Further, if $Det(G) = k \\geq 2$ and $t \\ge k-1$, then\n$Dist(\\mu^{(t)}(G))=2$, and $Det(\\mu^{(t)}(G)) = \\rho(\\mu^{(t)}(G))= k$. For\n$G$ with twins, we develop a framework using quotient graphs with respect to\nequivalence classes of twin vertices to give bounds on the determining number\nof Mycielskians. Moreover, we identify classes of graphs with twins for which\n$Det(\\mu^{(t)}(G)) = (t{+}1) Det(G)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 07:58:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 09:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

In this paper, we study the\nelectronic structure topology, spin Hall effect (SHE) and spin Nernst effect\n(SNE) in these compounds based on density functional theory calculations. First\nwe find that the four considered compounds are Dirac semimetals with the\nnonsymmorphic symmetry-protected Dirac line nodes along the Brillouin zone\nboundary $A$-$M$ and $X$-$R$ and low density of states (DOS) near the Fermi\nlevel ($E_F$). Second, the intrinsic SHE and SNE in some of these considered\ncompounds are found to be large. In particular, the calculated spin Hall\nconductivity (SHC) of HfCuGeAs is as large as -514 ($\\hbar$/e)(S/cm). The spin\nNernst conductivity (SNC) of HfCuGeAs at room temperature is also large, being\n-0.73 ($\\hbar$/e)(A/m-K). Moreover, both the magnitude and sign of the SHC and\nSNC in these compounds can be manipulated by varying either the applied\nelectric field direction or spin current direction. The SHE and SNE in these\ncompounds can also be enhanced by tuning the Fermi level via chemical doping or\nelectric gating. Finally, a detailed analysis of the band-decomposed and\n$k$-resolved spin Berry curvatures reveals that these large SHC and SNC as well\nas their notable tunabilities originate largely from the presence of a large\nnumber of spin-orbit coupling-gapped Dirac points near the Fermi level as well\nas the gapless Dirac line-nodes, which give rise to large spin Berry\ncurvatures. Our findings thus suggest that the four XCuYAs compounds not only\nprovide a valuable platform for exploring the interplay between SHE, SNE and\nband topology but also have promising applications in spintronics and spin\ncaloritronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 08:28:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

The pressure induced superconductivity is expected to be\ncompletely suppressed in the pressure region between 4.5 and 5.0 GPa.\nTemperature dependence of electrical resistivity in constant magnetic fields\nand high pressures, as well as the magnetoresistance measurements, reveal a\nlarge critical field, exceeding 19 T at 0.6 K and 2.4 GPa, sharply decreasing\nreceding the superconductivity dome. The previously reported $\\it{T-p}$ and\n$\\it{H-T}$ phase diagrams are completed by our high-pressure data and discussed\nin the frame of previous results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 08:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

In both cases, speed of particles is obtained from the calculus of\nthe mean square displacement (MSD) and typically, the theoretical formula of\nthe MSD is derived from the motion equations of an active Brownian particle.\nOne of the most commonly reported parameters is the speed of the particle,\nusually attributed to its propulsion, and is widely used to compare the motion\nefficiency of catalytic motors.

A great advantage of the use of Ca$^{2+}$ as replacement for\nLa$^{3+}$ is the similarity of its ionic radii. Thus, the observed magnetic\nchanges can more easily be associated to electronic variations. A thorough\ninvestigation of the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of the\nLa$_{2-x}$Ca$_{x}$CoIrO$_6$ system was carried out by means of synchrotron\nx-ray powder diffraction, muon spin rotation and relaxation ($\\mu$SR), AC and\nDC magnetization, XAS, XMCD, Raman spectroscopy, electrical resistivity and\ndielectric permittivity. Our XAS results show that up to 25% of Ca substitution\nat the La site results in the emergence of Co$^{3+}$, possibly in high spin\nstate, while the introduction of larger amount of Ca leads to the increase of\nIr valence. The competing magnetic interactions resulting from the mixed\nvalences lead to a coexistence of a magnetically ordered and an emerging spin\nglass (SG) state for the doped samples.

Attenuation is\nan additional parameter that needs to be taken into account in viscous media to\nexploit the full potential of FWI. Attenuation is more easily implemented in\nthe frequency domain by using complex-valued velocities in the time-harmonic\nwave equation. These complex velocities are frequency-dependent to guarantee\ncausality and account for dispersion. Since estimating a complex\nfrequency-dependent velocity at each grid point in space is not realistic, the\noptimization is generally performed in the real domain by processing the phase\nvelocity (or slowness) at a reference frequency and attenuation (or quality\nfactor) as separate real parameters. This real parametrization requires an a\npriori empirical relation (such as the nonlinear Kolsky-Futterman (KF) or\nstandard linear solid (SLS) attenuation models) between the complex velocity\nand the two real quantities, which is prone to generate modeling errors if it\ndoes not represent accurately the attenuation behavior of the subsurface.\nMoreover, it leads to a multivariate inverse problem, which is twice larger\nthan the actual size of the medium and ill-posed due to the cross-talk between\nthe two classes of real parameters. To alleviate these issues, we present a\nmono-variate algorithm that solves directly the optimization problem in the\ncomplex domain by processing in sequence narrow bands of frequencies under the\nassumption of band-wise frequency dependence of the sought complex velocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 09:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

In this review, we\nperform a detailed theoretical and phenomenological analysis of two largely\nexplored extensions of $f(R)$ gravity, namely: (i) the hybrid metric-Palatini\ntheory; (ii) and modified gravity with curvature-matter couplings. Relative to\nthe former, it has been established that both metric and Palatini versions of\n$f(R)$ gravity possess interesting features but also manifest severe drawbacks.\nA hybrid combination, containing elements from both of these formalisms, turns\nout to be very successful in accounting for the observed phenomenology and\navoids some drawbacks of the original approaches. Relative to the\ncurvature-matter coupling theories, these offer interesting extensions of\n$f(R)$ gravity, where the explicit nonminimal couplings between an arbitrary\nfunction of the scalar curvature $R$ and the Lagrangian density of matter,\ninduces a non-vanishing covariant derivative of the energy-momentum tensor.

We show, on the one hand, that\nSynchronized Planarity can be solved in quadratic time, and, on the other hand,\nthat it serves as a powerful modeling language that lets us easily formulate\nseveral constrained planarity problems as instances of Synchronized Planarity.\nIn particular, this lets us solve Clustered Planarity in quadratic time, where\nthe most efficient previously known algorithm has an upper bound of $O(n^{8})$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 10:26:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 07:49:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

Although these objects are\nall fluid, hydrogen worlds with stratified atmospheres overlying convective\ninteriors, they exhibit an impressive diversity of atmospheric behavior. Hot\nJupiters are strongly irradiated, and a wealth of observations constrain the\nday-night temperature differences, circulation, and cloudiness. The intense\nstellar irradiation, presumed tidal locking and modest rotation leads to a\nnovel regime of strong day-night radiative forcing. Circulation models predict\nlarge day-night temperature differences, global-scale eddies, patchy clouds,\nand, in most cases, a fast eastward jet at the equator-equatorial\nsuperrotation. The warm Jupiters may exhibit a wide range of rotation rates,\nobliquities, and orbital eccentricities, which, along with the weaker\nirradiation, leads to circulation patterns and observable signatures predicted\nto differ substantially from hot Jupiters. Brown dwarfs are typically isolated,\nrapidly rotating worlds; they radiate enormous energy fluxes into space and\nconvect vigorously in their interiors. Their atmospheres exhibit patchiness in\nclouds and temperature on regional to global scales-the result of modulation by\nlarge-scale atmospheric circulation. Despite the lack of irradiation, such\ncirculations can be driven by interaction of the interior convection with the\noverlying atmosphere, as well as self-organization of patchiness due to\ncloud-dynamical-radiative feedbacks. Finally, irradiated brown dwarfs help to\nbridge the gap between these classes of objects, experiencing intense external\nirradiation as well as vigorous interior convection. A hierarchy of modeling\napproaches have yielded major new insights into the dynamics governing these\nphenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 10:34:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 09:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

Previous\nworks have shown a connection between the structural organization of cities and\nthe movement patterns of their residents. This puts urban centers in the focus\nof epidemic surveillance and interventions. Here we show that the organization\nof urban flows has a tremendous impact on disease spreading and on the\namenability of different mitigation strategies. By studying anonymous and\naggregated intra-urban flows in a variety of cities in the United States and\nother countries, and a combination of empirical analysis and analytical\nmethods, we demonstrate that the response of cities to epidemic spreading can\nbe roughly classified in two major types according to the overall organization\nof those flows. Hierarchical cities, where flows are concentrated primarily\nbetween mobility hotspots, are particularly vulnerable to the rapid spread of\nepidemics. Nevertheless, mobility restrictions in such types of cities are very\neffective in mitigating the spread of a virus. Conversely, in sprawled cities\nwhich present many centers of activity, the spread of an epidemic is much\nslower, but the response to mobility restrictions is much weaker and less\neffective. Investing resources on early monitoring and prompt ad-hoc\ninterventions in more vulnerable cities may prove helpful in containing and\nreducing the impact of future pandemics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 10:44:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 11:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-11"}

The Hoyle state\nis above the $\\alpha$ threshold, and the rate of stellar carbon production\ndepends on the radiative width of this state. The radiative width cannot be\nmeasured directly, and must instead be deduced by combining three separately\nmeasured quantities. One of these quantities is the $E0$ decay branching ratio\nof the Hoyle state, and the current $10$\\% uncertainty on the radiative width\nstems mainly from the uncertainty on this ratio. The $E0$ branching ratio was\ndeduced from a series of pair conversion measurements of the $E0$ and $E2$\ntransitions depopulating the $0^+_2$ Hoyle state and $2^+_1$ state in $^{12}$C,\nrespectively. The excited states were populated by the $^{12}$C$(p,p^\\prime)$\nreaction at 10.5 MeV beam energy, and the pairs were detected with the\nelectron-positron pair spectrometer, Super-e, at the Australian National\nUniversity. The deduced branching ratio required knowledge of the proton\npopulation of the two states, as well as the alignment of the $2^+_1$ state in\nthe reaction. For this purpose, proton scattering and $\\gamma$-ray angular\ndistribution experiments were also performed.

When, at a given point,\nthe electromagnetic field is non-null, or the gravitational field is of\nWeyl-Petrov type I or D, principal observers instantaneously passing through\nthat point always exist.

It provides a novel way of ranking a sample of curves from the\ncenter outwards and defining robust statistics, such as the median or trimmed\nmeans. It has also been used as a building block for functional outlier\ndetection methods and classification. Several notions of depth for functional\ndata were introduced in the literature in the last few decades. These\nfunctional depths can only be directly applied to samples of curves measured on\na fine and common grid. In practice, this is not always the case, and curves\nare often observed at sparse and subject dependent grids. In these scenarios\nthe usual approach consists in estimating the trajectories on a common dense\ngrid, and using the estimates in the depth analysis. This approach ignores the\nuncertainty associated with the curves estimation step. Our goal is to extend\nthe notion of depth so that it takes into account this uncertainty. Using both\nfunctional estimates and their associated confidence intervals, we propose a\nnew method that allows the curve estimation uncertainty to be incorporated into\nthe depth analysis. We describe the new approach using the modified band depth\nalthough any other functional depth could be used.

The local nature of the RF algorithm, based on intra-node\nmeans and variances, is ideal when errors are i.i.d. For dependent error\nprocesses like time series and spatial settings where data in all the nodes\nwill be correlated, operating locally ignores this dependence. Also, RF will\ninvolve resampling of correlated data, violating the principles of bootstrap.\nTheoretically, consistency of RF has been established for i.i.d. errors, but\nlittle is known about the case of dependent errors.\n  We propose RF-GLS, a novel extension of RF for dependent error processes in\nthe same way Generalized Least Squares (GLS) fundamentally extends Ordinary\nLeast Squares (OLS) for linear models under dependence. The key to this\nextension is the equivalent representation of the local decision-making in a\nregression tree as a global OLS optimization which is then replaced with a GLS\nloss to create a GLS-style regression tree. This also synergistically addresses\nthe resampling issue, as the use of GLS loss amounts to resampling uncorrelated\ncontrasts (pre-whitened data) instead of the correlated data. For spatial\nsettings, RF-GLS can be used in conjunction with Gaussian Process correlated\nerrors to generate kriging predictions at new locations. RF becomes a special\ncase of RF-GLS with an identity working covariance matrix.\n  We establish consistency of RF-GLS under beta- (absolutely regular) mixing\nerror processes and show that this general result subsumes important cases like\nautoregressive time series and spatial Matern Gaussian Processes. As a\nbyproduct, we also establish consistency of RF for beta-mixing processes, which\nto our knowledge, is the first such result for RF under dependence.\n  We empirically demonstrate the improvement achieved by RF-GLS over RF for\nboth estimation and prediction under dependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 12:36:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 15:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

Gravitational\n$N$-body simulations of a disk system made up of numerous planetesimals are the\nmost direct way to study the accretion process. However, the use of $N$-body\nsimulations has been limited to idealized models (e.g. perfect accretion)\nand/or narrow spatial ranges in the radial direction, due to the limited number\nof simulation runs and particles available. We have developed new $N$-body\nsimulation code equipped with a particle-particle particle-tree (${\\rm P^3T}$)\nscheme for studying the planetary system formation process: GPLUM. For each\nparticle, GPLUM uses the fourth-order Hermite scheme to calculate gravitational\ninteractions with particles within cut-off radii and the Barnes-Hut tree scheme\nfor particles outside the cut-off radii. In existing implementations, ${\\rm\nP^3T}$ schemes use the same cut-off radius for all particles, making a\nsimulation become slower when the mass range of the planetesimal population\nbecomes wider. We have solved this problem by allowing each particle to have an\nappropriate cut-off radius depending on its mass, its distance from the central\nstar, and the local velocity dispersion of planetesimals. In addition to\nachieving a significant speed-up, we have also improved the scalability of the\ncode to reach a good strong-scaling performance up to 1024 cores in the case of\n$N=10^6$.

A question of critical importance for the understanding of star\nformation is how to observationally discern whether a core has already\ninitiated gravitational collapse or is still in hydrostatic balance. The\ncanonical method to identify gravitational collapse is based on the observed\ndensity radial profile, which would change from a Bonnor-Ebert type toward\npower laws as the core collapses. In practice, due to the projection effect,\nthe resolution limit, and other caveats, it has been difficult to directly\nreveal the dynamical status of cores, particularly in massive star-forming\nregions. We here propose a novel, straight-forward diagnostic, namely, the\ncollapsing index (CI), which can be modeled and calculated based on the radial\nprofile of the line width of dense gas. A meaningful measurement of CI requires\nspatially and spectrally resolved images of optically thin and chemically\nstable dense gas tracers. ALMA observations are making such data sets\nincreasingly available for massive star-forming regions. Applying our method to\none of the deepest dense-gas spectral images ever taken toward such a region,\nnamely, the Orion molecular cloud, we detect the dynamical status of selected\ncores therein. We observationally distinguished a collapsing core in a massive\nstar-forming region from a hydrostatical one. Our approach would help\nsignificantly improve our understanding of the interaction between gravity and\nturbulence within molecular cloud cores in the process of star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 13:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

Remote\nclassification is challenged by the finite and variable data rate of the\nwireless channel, which affects the capability to transfer high-dimensional\nfeatures and thus limits the classification resolution. We introduce a set of\nmetrics under the name of classification capacity that are defined as the\nmaximum number of classes that can be discerned over a given communication\nchannel while meeting a target classification error probability. The objective\nis to choose a subset of classes from a library that offers satisfactory\nperformance over a given channel. We treat two cases of subset selection.\nFirst, a device can select the subset by pruning the class library until\narriving at a subset that meets the targeted error probability while maximizing\nthe classification capacity. Adopting a subspace data model, we prove the\nequivalence of classification capacity maximization to Grassmannian packing.\nThe results show that the classification capacity grows exponentially with the\ninstantaneous communication rate, and super-exponentially with the dimensions\nof each data cluster. This also holds for ergodic and outage capacities with\nfading if the instantaneous rate is replaced with an average rate and a fixed\nrate, respectively. In the second case, a device has a preference of class\nsubset for every communication rate, which is modeled as an instance of\nuniformly sampling the library. Without class selection, the classification\ncapacity and its ergodic and outage counterparts are proved to scale linearly\nwith their corresponding communication rates instead of the exponential growth\nin the last case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 14:20:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-31"}

Instead of a naive scheme of listing\nthe indices of the $k$ active users in the order in which they should transmit,\nat a cost of $k\\log(n)$ bits, this paper shows that for the case of $b=k$, the\nrate of the minimum fixed-length common feedback code scales only as $k\n\\log(e)$ bits, plus an additive term that scales in $n$ as $\\Theta \\left(\\log\n\\log(n) \\right)$ for fixed $k$. If a variable-length code can be used, assuming\nuniform activity among the users, the minimum average common feedback rate\nstill requires $k \\log(e)$ bits, but the dependence on $n$ can be reduced to\n$O(1)$. When $b>k$, the number of feedback bits needed for collision-free\nscheduling can be significantly further reduced. Moreover, a similar scaling on\nthe minimum feedback rate is derived for the case of scheduling $m$ users per\nslot, when $k \\le mb$. The problem of constructing a minimum collision-free\nfeedback scheduling code is connected to that of constructing a perfect hashing\nfamily, which allows practical feedback scheduling codes to be constructed from\nperfect hashing algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 14:42:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 02:28:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 05:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

The protocol assumes that\ncommunity members use a trust-graph to determine the genuineness of digital\nidentities, and that doing so bounds the number of sybils (fake or duplicate\nidentities) in the community, but does not completely eliminate them. The main\ngoal of the protocol is to be resilient to the sybils that penetrate the\ncommunity, in the sense that, in the long run, only genuine identities mint\ncoins. The protocol accepts that sybils penetrate the community from time to\ntime (by gaining enough trust within the trust-graph), yet assumes that every\nsybil is eventually exposed. Since coins minted by a sybil will most probably\ncirculate by the time it is exposed, the protocol puts the responsibility for\nintroducing a sybil onto its trusting neighbours and confiscates subsequent\ncoins minted by them, until the coins minted by that sybil are accounted for.\nIn particular, the protocol confiscates two coins for each coin minted by the\nsybil: one to recover what was wrongly minted and one as a fine for introducing\nthe sybil in the first place. We argue that this approach constitutes a\nmechanism to deter the introduction of sybils into the community and to\nincentivize sybil hunting (using part of the confiscated money as a reward).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 15:44:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 16:06:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 13:25:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 08:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

To attain\nhigh spatial and temporal fidelity in field conditions, we propose the\napplication of continuous-time 3D SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping)\nto a spinning lidar payload (AgScan3D) mounted on a moving farm vehicle. The\nAgScan3D data is processed through a Continuous-Time SLAM algorithm into a\nglobally registered 3D ray cloud. The global ray cloud is a canonical data\nformat (a digital twin) from which we can compare vineyard snapshots over\nmultiple times within a season and across seasons. Then, the vineyard rows are\nautomatically extracted from the ray cloud and a novel density calculation is\nperformed to estimate the maximum likelihood canopy densities of the vineyard.\nThis combination of digital twinning, together with the accurate extraction of\ncanopy structure information, allows entire vineyards to be analysed and\ncompared, across the growing season and from year to year. The proposed method\nis evaluated both in simulation and field experiments.

AI has also contributed to\ndealing with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has been\nhappening around the globe. This paper presents a survey of AI methods being\nused in various applications in the fight against the COVID-19 outbreak and\noutlines the crucial role of AI research in this unprecedented battle. We touch\non areas where AI plays as an essential component, from medical image\nprocessing, data analytics, text mining and natural language processing, the\nInternet of Things, to computational biology and medicine. A summary of\nCOVID-19 related data sources that are available for research purposes is also\npresented. Research directions on exploring the potential of AI and enhancing\nits capability and power in the pandemic battle are thoroughly discussed. We\nidentify 13 groups of problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight\npromising AI methods and tools that can be used to address these problems. It\nis envisaged that this study will provide AI researchers and the wider\ncommunity with an overview of the current status of AI applications, and\nmotivate researchers to harness AI's potential in the fight against COVID-19.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 11:11:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 03:20:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 07:40:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 03:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

This\nis achieved by imbedding a single crystal BAW resonator between the post and\nthe adjacent wall of a microwave reentrant cavity resonator. This 3D photonic\nlumped LC resonator at the same time acts as the electrodes of a BAW phonon\nresonator, and allows the direct readout of coherent phonons via the linear\npiezoelectric response of the quartz. A microwave pump, $\\omega_p$ is tuned to\nthe cavity resonance $\\omega_0$, while a probe frequency, $\\omega_{probe}$, is\ndetuned and varied around the red and blue detuned values with respect to the\nBAW phonon frequency, $\\Omega_m$. The pump and probe power dependence of the\ngenerated phonons unequivocally determines the process to be electrostrictive,\nwith the phonons produced at the difference frequency between pump and probe,\nwith no back action effects involved. Thus, the phonons are created without\nthreshold and can be considered analogous to a Coherent Population Trapped\n(CPT) maser scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 08:04:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 07:32:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 12:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}
