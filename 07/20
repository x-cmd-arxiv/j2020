Approximations to the Bayes factor, such as the\nBayesian Information Criterion (BIC), are increasingly used.

Furthermore, data\ncollected by the edge device may contain the user's private data, which is\nchallenging the current detection approaches as user privacy is calling for the\npublic concern in recent years. With this focus, this paper proposes a new\ncommunication-efficient on-device federated learning (FL)-based deep anomaly\ndetection framework for sensing time-series data in IIoT. Specifically, we\nfirst introduce a FL framework to enable decentralized edge devices to\ncollaboratively train an anomaly detection model, which can improve its\ngeneralization ability. Second, we propose an Attention Mechanism-based\nConvolutional Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory (AMCNN-LSTM) model to\naccurately detect anomalies. The AMCNN-LSTM model uses attention\nmechanism-based CNN units to capture important fine-grained features, thereby\npreventing memory loss and gradient dispersion problems. Furthermore, this\nmodel retains the advantages of LSTM unit in predicting time series data.\nThird, to adapt the proposed framework to the timeliness of industrial anomaly\ndetection, we propose a gradient compression mechanism based on Top-\\textit{k}\nselection to improve communication efficiency. Extensive experiment studies on\nfour real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can accurately\nand timely detect anomalies and also reduce the communication overhead by 50\\%\ncompared to the federated learning framework that does not use a gradient\ncompression scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 16:47:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

Here, we\ncompare the performance of a Gatan K2 Summit DED to an UltraScan 1000 CCD for\nuse in signal-limited atomic-resolution STEM-EELS experiments.

The longstanding shortest path problem in a deterministic network,\nwhose counterpart in a congestion game setting is Wardrop equilibrium, has been\nstudied extensively, but it is well known that finding the notion of an optimal\npath is challenging in a traffic network with stochastic arc delays. In this\nwork, we propose three classes of risk-averse equilibria for an atomic\nstochastic congestion game in its general form where the arc delay\ndistributions are load dependent and not necessarily independent of each other.\nThe three classes are risk-averse equilibrium (RAE), mean-variance equilibrium\n(MVE), and conditional value at risk level $\\alpha$ equilibrium\n(CVaR$_\\alpha$E) whose notions of risk-averse best responses are based on\nmaximizing the probability of taking the shortest path, minimizing a linear\ncombination of mean and variance of path delay, and minimizing the expected\ndelay at a specified risky quantile of the delay distributions, respectively.\nWe prove that for any finite stochastic atomic congestion game, the\nrisk-averse, mean-variance, and CVaR$_\\alpha$ equilibria exist. We show that\nfor risk-averse travelers, the Braess paradox may not occur to the extent\npresented originally since players do not necessarily travel along the shortest\npath in expectation, but they take the uncertainty of travel time into\nconsideration as well. We show through some examples that the price of anarchy\ncan be improved when players are risk-averse and travel according to one of the\nthree classes of risk-averse equilibria rather than the Wardrop equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 20:12:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

The advantage of surface wave\nmethods over traditional forms of site characterization is that measurements\nmade solely at the ground surface can be used routinely and economically to\ninfer the subsurface structure of a site to depths of engineering interest\n(20-50 m), and much greater depths (>1 km) in some special cases. However, the\nquantification and propagation of uncertainties from surface wave measurements\ninto the Vs profiles used in subsequent engineering analyses remains\nchallenging. While this has been the focus of much work in recent years, and\nwhile considerable progress has been made, no approach for doing so has been\nwidely accepted, leading analysts to either address the propagation of\nuncertainties in their own specialized manner or, worse, to ignore these\nuncertainties entirely. In response, this paper presents an easy-to-implement,\neffective, and verifiable method for developing uncertainty-consistent Vs\nprofiles from inversion of surface wave dispersion data. We begin by examining\nfour approaches presented in the literature for developing suites of Vs\nprofiles meant to account for uncertainty present in the measured dispersion\ndata.

First,\nall approaches are shown to be highly sensitive to their many user-defined\ninversion input parameters, making it difficult/impossible for them to be\nperformed repeatedly by different analysts. Second, the suites of inverted Vs\nprofiles, when viewed in terms of their implied theoretical dispersion data,\nare shown to significantly underestimate the uncertainty present in the\nexperimental dispersion data, though some may appear satisfactory when viewed\npurely qualitatively...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 20:17:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2021 17:41:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

A well-known one is the position bias -- documents\nin top positions are more likely to receive clicks due in part to their\nposition advantages. To unbiasedly learn to rank, existing counterfactual\nframeworks first estimate the propensity (probability) of missing clicks with\nintervention data from a small portion of search traffic, and then use inverse\npropensity score (IPS) to debias LTR algorithms on the whole data set. These\napproaches often assume the propensity only depends on the position of the\ndocument, which may cause high estimation variance in applications where the\nsearch context (e.g. query, user) varies frequently. While context-dependent\npropensity models reduce variance, accurate estimations may require\nrandomization or intervention on a large amount of traffic, which may not be\nrealistic in real-world systems, especially for long tail queries. In this\nwork, we employ heterogeneous treatment effect estimation techniques to\nestimate position bias when intervention click data is limited.

For this exact estimator, an asymptotic analysis on the performance\nis carried out using a new replica method that is refined from certain aspects.\nA decoupling principle is then established, suggesting that, in terms of joint\ninput-and-estimate distribution, the original estimation problem of\nmultiple-input multiple-output is indeed identical to a simple single-input\nsingle-output one subjected to additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) only. The\nvariance of the AWGN is further shown to be determined by some coupled\nequations, whose dependency on the weighting and activation is given explicitly\nand analytically. Comparing to existing results, this paper is the first to\noffer a decoupling principle for the ML-GLM estimation problem.

However,\nit is still a challenging task to execute 3D Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) targeting for real-time performance, besides high inference accuracy.\nThe reason is more complex model structure and higher model dimensionality\noverwhelm the available computation/storage resources on mobile devices. A\nnatural way may be turning to deep learning weight pruning techniques. However,\nthe direct generalization of existing 2D CNN weight pruning methods to 3D CNNs\nis not ideal for fully exploiting mobile parallelism while achieving high\ninference accuracy.\n  This paper proposes RT3D, a model compression and mobile acceleration\nframework for 3D CNNs, seamlessly integrating neural network weight pruning and\ncompiler code generation techniques. We propose and investigate two structured\nsparsity schemes i.e., the vanilla structured sparsity and kernel group\nstructured (KGS) sparsity that are mobile acceleration friendly. The vanilla\nsparsity removes whole kernel groups, while KGS sparsity is a more fine-grained\nstructured sparsity that enjoys higher flexibility while exploiting full\non-device parallelism. We propose a reweighted regularization pruning algorithm\nto achieve the proposed sparsity schemes. The inference time speedup due to\nsparsity is approaching the pruning rate of the whole model FLOPs (floating\npoint operations). RT3D demonstrates up to 29.1$\\times$ speedup in end-to-end\ninference time comparing with current mobile frameworks supporting 3D CNNs,\nwith moderate 1%-1.5% accuracy loss.

Additionally, it is often the goal to\nestimate how the treatment effect varies across observed units. To address this\ngap, we propose a semiparametric model using Bayesian tree ensembles for\nestimating the causal effect of a continuous treatment of exposure which (i)\ndoes not require a priori parametric specification of the influence of control\nvariables, and (ii) allows for identification of effect modification by\npre-specified moderators. The main parametric assumption we make is that the\neffect of the exposure on the outcome is linear, with the steepness of this\nrelationship determined by a nonparametric function of the moderators, and we\nprovide heuristics to diagnose the validity of this assumption.

Whether the mass\ntransfer is dynamically stable is one of the essential questions in binary\nevolution. In the limit of extremely rapid mass transfer, the response of a\ndonor star in an interacting binary becomes asymptotically one of adiabatic\nexpansion. We use the adiabatic mass loss model to systematically survey the\nthresholds for dynamical timescale mass transfer over the entire span of\npossible donor star evolutionary states. We also simulate mass loss process\nwith isentropic envelopes, the specific entropy of which is fixed to be that at\nthe base of the convective envelope, to artificially mimic the effect of such\nmass loss in superadiabatic surface convection regions, where the adiabatic\napproximation fails. We illustrate the general adiabatic response of 3.2 Msun\ndonor stars at different evolutionary stages. We extend our study to a grid of\ndonor stars with different masses (from 0.1 to 100 Msun with Z = 0.02) and at\ndifferent evolutionary stages. We proceed to present our criteria for\ndynamically unstable mass transfer in both tabular and graphical forms. For red\ngiant branch and asymptotic giant branch donors in systems with such mass\nratios, they may have convective envelopes deep enough to evolve into common\nenvelopes on a thermal timescale, if the donor star overfills its outer\nLagrangian radius. Our results show that the red giant branch and asymptotic\ngiant branch stars tend to be more stable than previously believed, and this\nmay be helpful to explain the abundance of observed post-AGB binary stars with\nan orbital period of around 1000 days.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 02:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

In this work, we first empirically find the recognition accuracy\nis highly correlated with the bounding box size of an actor, and thus higher\nresolution of actors contributes to better performance. However, video models\nrequire dense sampling in time to achieve accurate recognition. To fit in GPU\nmemory, the frames to backbone network must be kept low-resolution, resulting\nin a coarse feature map in RoI-Pooling layer. Thus, we revisit RCNN for\nactor-centric action recognition via cropping and resizing image patches around\nactors before feature extraction with I3D deep network. Moreover, we found that\nexpanding actor bounding boxes slightly and fusing the context features can\nfurther boost the performance.

Second,\nwhile longer sequences are more informative for modelling the sensor dynamics\nof equipment, existing methods are less effective to deal with very long\nsequences, as they mainly focus on the latest information.

This would in reality displace a remarkable portion of the\ngaseous phase which is commonly ignored in the standard EL approaches. In\naddition, deformation of droplet due to the interaction of aerodynamic force,\nsurface tension and viscous forces is typically neglected in modeling dense\nsprays. In this work, to capture the volumetric displacement effects using an\nEL approach, the spatio-temporal changes in the volume fraction of the gaseous\nphase are taken into account. This leads to zero-Mach number, variable density\nequations that give rise to a source term in both momentum and continuity\nequations. It is shown that the continuity source term increases the velocity\nand dynamics of the carrier phase close to the nozzle. However, owing to the\njet spread and dispersion of droplets, these effects decrease further\ndownstream. In order to quantify the droplet deformation effects, different\nmodels are compared together with an experimental data.

The optimal\nconsumption policy is determined by personal information about the retiree such\nas age, wealth, risk aversion and bequest motive, as well as a series of\neconomic and financial variables including inflation rates and asset returns\njointly simulated from a proposed seven-factor economic scenario generator\ncalibrated from market data. We use the Australian pension system as an\nexample, with consideration of the government-funded means-tested Age Pension\nand other practical aspects such as fund management fees. The key findings from\nour numerical tests are as follows. First, our deep neural network optimal\nconsumption policy, which adapts to changes in market conditions, outperforms\ndeterministic drawdown rules proposed in the literature. Moreover, the\nout-of-sample outperformance ratios increase as the number of training\niterations increases, eventually reaching outperformance on all testing\nscenarios after less than 10 minutes of training. Second, a sensitivity\nanalysis is performed to reveal how risk aversion and bequest motives change\nthe consumption over a retiree's lifetime under this utility framework. Third,\nwe provide the optimal consumption rate with different starting wealth\nbalances. We observe that optimal consumption rates are not proportional to\ninitial wealth due to the Age Pension payment. Forth, with the same initial\nwealth balance and utility parameter settings, the optimal consumption level is\ndifferent between males and females due to gender differences in mortality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 07:33:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 07:38:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

Such leakage arises from the presence of `ambiguous' modes\nthat satisfy properties of both $E$ and $B$ modes. Solving this problem is\ncritical for primordial polarization $B$ mode detection in partial sky CMB\npolarization experiments. In this work we introduce a new method for reducing\nthe leakage. We demonstrate that if we complement the $E$-mode information\noutside the observation patch with ancillary data from full-sky CMB\nobservations, we can reduce and even effectively remove the $E$-to-$B$ leakage.\nFor this objective, we produce $E$-mode Stokes $QU$ maps from Wiener filtered\nfull-sky intensity and polarization CMB observations. We use these maps to fill\nthe sky region that is not observed by the ground-based experiment of interest,\nand thus complement the partial sky Stokes $QU$ maps. Since the $E$-mode\ninformation is now available on the full sky we see a significant reduction in\nthe $E$-to-$B$ leakage.

In this paper, we propose\na novel two-sided D2D trading market model that enables a large number of\nlocally connected users to trade resources. Traditional resource allocation\nsolutions are mostly centralized without considering users' local D2D\nconnectivity constraints, becoming unscalable for large-scale trading. In\naddition, there may be market failure since selfish users will not truthfully\nreport their actual valuations and quantities for buying or selling resources.\nTo address these two key challenges, we first investigate the distributed\nresource allocation problem with D2D assignment constraints.

This method exploits\nthe transfer of coherence between single- (SQ) or double-quantum (DQ)\n${}^{14}$N coherences, and SQ coherences of a suitable spin-1/2 'spy' nucleus,\ne.g., ${}^1$H. It must be noted that SQ-SQ methods require a carefully\noptimized setup to minimize the broadening related to the first-order\nquadrupole interaction (i.e., an extremely well-adjusted magic angle and a\nhighly stable spinning speed), whereas DQ-SQ ones do not. In this work, the\nefficiencies of four ${}^{14}$N excitation schemes (DANTE, XiX, Hard Pulse\n(HP), and Selective Long Pulse (SLP)) are compared using J-HMQC based numerical\nsimulations and either SQ-SQ or DQ-SQ ${}^1$H-{${}^{14}$N} D-HMQC experiments\non L-histidine HCl and N-acetyl-L-valine at 18.8 T and 62.5 kHz MAS. The\nresults demonstrate that both DANTE and SLP provide a more efficient 14N\nexcitation profile than XiX and HP. Furthermore, it is shown that the SLP\nscheme: (i) is efficient over a large range of quadrupole interaction, (ii) is\nhighly robust to offset and rf-pulse length and amplitude, and (iii) is very\nsimple to set up. These factors make SLP ideally suited to widespread,\nnon-specialist use in solid-state NMR analyses of nitrogen-containing\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 08:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

Maximizing the network\nsize that fits on a given accelerator thus requires to maximize its memory\nutilization. While the traditionally used ping-pong buffering technique is\nmapping subsequent activation layers to disjunctive memory regions, we propose\na mapping method that allows these regions to overlap and thus utilize the\nmemory more efficiently.

The rapid\ndevelopment of deep learning technologies provides the feasibility of building\na computer-aided system for the fast and accurate segmentation of cornea and\niris tissues.

The tunability of spin texture upon switching of AFM order parameter\nis largely unexplored and our findings not only provide a platform to\nunderstand the physics of AFM spin texture but also support the AFM HOIP\nferroelectrics as a promising class of optoelectronic materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 11:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

Learning to find an optimal\nmixed precision model that can preserve accuracy and satisfy the specific\nconstraints on model size and computation is extremely challenge due to the\ndifficult in training a mixed precision model and the huge space of all\npossible bit quantizations. In this paper, we propose a novel soft Barrier\nPenalty based NAS (BP-NAS) for mixed precision quantization, which ensures all\nthe searched models are inside the valid domain defined by the complexity\nconstraint, thus could return an optimal model under the given constraint by\nconducting search only one time. The proposed soft Barrier Penalty is\ndifferentiable and can impose very large losses to those models outside the\nvalid domain while almost no punishment for models inside the valid domain,\nthus constraining the search only in the feasible domain.

The initial depth prediction is then iteratively refined by its\nconfidence and non-local spatial propagation procedure based on the predicted\nnon-local neighbors and corresponding affinities.

Our approach is inspired by a Machine Learning ensemble\ntechnique, the Random Forest, and for that, we named our approach as ELECTRE\nTree algorithm. Methodology: First, we generate a set of ELECTRE Tri-B models,\nwhere each model solves a random sample of criteria and alternatives. Each\nsample is made with replacement, having at least two criteria and between 10%\nto 25% of alternatives. Each model has its parameters optimized by a genetic\nalgorithm that can use an ordered cluster or an assignment example as a\nreference to the optimization. Finally, after the optimization phase, two\nprocedures can be performed, the first one will merge all models, finding in\nthis way the elicitated parameters, and in the second procedure each\nalternative is classified (voted) by each separated model, and the majority\nvote decides the final class.

In contrast, the merged\nmodel generates linear decision boundaries.

This branch of study is composed of some applications such\nas machine translation, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, question\nand answer, and others. Word embeddings are continuous word representations,\nthey are an essential module for those applications and are generally used as\ninput word representation to the deep learning models. Word2Vec and GloVe are\ntwo popular methods to learn word embeddings. They achieve good word\nrepresentations, however, they learn representations with limited information\nbecause they ignore the morphological information of the words and consider\nonly one representation vector for each word. This approach implies that\nWord2Vec and GloVe are unaware of the word inner structure. To mitigate this\nproblem, the FastText model represents each word as a bag of characters\nn-grams. Hence, each n-gram has a continuous vector representation, and the\nfinal word representation is the sum of its characters n-grams vectors.\nNevertheless, the use of all n-grams character of a word is a poor approach\nsince some n-grams have no semantic relation with their words and increase the\namount of potentially useless information. This approach also increases the\ntraining phase time. In this work, we propose a new method for training word\nembeddings, and its goal is to replace the FastText bag of character n-grams\nfor a bag of word morphemes through the morphological analysis of the word.\nThus, words with similar context and morphemes are represented by vectors close\nto each other.

Meanwhile, some\nchallenges inherent to Li/S batteries remain to be tackled, for instance, the\npolysulfide (PS) shuttle effect, the irreversible solidification of Li$_2$S,\nand the volume expansion of the cathode material during discharge. On the\nmolecular level, these issues originate from the structural and solubility\nbehavior of the PS species in bulk and in the electrode confinement. In this\nstudy, we use classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to develop a\nworking model for PS of different chain lengths in applied electrolyte\nsolutions of lithium bistriflimide (LiTFSI) in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) and\n1,3-dioxolane (DOL) mixtures. We investigate conductivities, diffusion\ncoefficients, solvation structures, and clustering behavior and verify our\nsimulation model with experimental measurements available in literature and\nnewly performed by us. Our results show that diffusion coefficients and\nconductivities are significantly influenced by the chain length of PS. The\nconductivity contribution of the short chains, like Li$_2$S$_4$, is lower than\nof longer PS chains, such as Li$_2$S$_6$ or Li$_2$S$_8$, despite the fact that\nthe diffusion coefficient of Li$_2$S$_4$ is higher than for longer PS chains.\nThe low conductivity of Li$_2$S$_4$ can be attributed to its low degree of\ndissociation and even to a formation of large clusters in the solution. It is\nalso found that an addition of 1 M LiTFSI into PS solutions considerably\nreduces the clustering behavior. Our simulation model enables future systematic\nstudies in various solvating and confining systems for the rational design of\nLi/S electrolytes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 13:17:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

An\nevolutionary algorithm that uses an indirect representation and the nearest\nneighbor based constructive procedure was proposed to solve this problem.\nIndividuals evolved in this evolutionary algorithm do not directly code the\nsolutions to the problem. Instead, they represent sequences of instructions to\nconstruct a feasible solution. The problems with efficiently generating\nfeasible solutions typically arising when applying traditional evolutionary\nalgorithms to constrained optimization problems are eliminated this way. The\nproposed exploration framework was evaluated in a simulated environment on\nthree maps and the time needed to explore the whole environment was compared to\nstate-of-the-art exploration methods. Experimental results show that our method\noutperforms the compared ones in environments with a low density of obstacles\nby up to 12.5%, while it is slightly worse in office-like environments by 4.5%\nat maximum. The framework has also been deployed on a real robot to demonstrate\nthe applicability of the proposed solution with real hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 13:31:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

In this work, we combine compression isotherms, atomic force\nmicroscopy imaging, and computer simulations to further investigate the\nbehavior of pH-responsive microgels at oil-water interfaces. At low\ncompression, charged microgels can be compressed more than uncharged microgels.\nThe in-plane effective area of charged microgels is found to be smaller in\ncomparison to uncharged ones. Thus, the compressibility is governed by in-plane\ninteractions of the microgels with the interface. At high compression, however,\ncharged microgels are less compressible than uncharged microgels. Microgel\nfractions located in the aqueous phase interact earlier for charged than for\nuncharged microgels because of their different swelling perpendicular to the\ninterface. Therefore, the compressibility at high compression is controlled by\nout-of-plane interactions. In addition, the size of the investigated microgels\nplays a pivotal role. The charge-dependent difference in compressibility at low\ncompression is only observed for small but not for large microgels, while the\nbehavior at high compression does not depend on the size. Our results highlight\nthe complex nature of soft polymer microgels as compared to rigid colloidal\nparticles.

Whereas the Reynolds\nnumber, the mass ratio and the damping ratio are fixed. A secondary VIV lock-in\nregion is found in the cases of high Richardson number Ri=2.0 for high reduced\nvelocity values, in which the buoyancy-driven flow is non-trivial. A wide VIV\nlock-in region is formed with tremendous energy transfer between fluid and\nstructure, which is extremely meaningful for hydropower harvesting. The\ninfluences of Prandtl and Richardson numbers on the hydrodynamics, structural\ndynamics and heat transfer are discussed in detail. The temperature contours\nare concentrated around cylinder for the cases of high Prandtl number, which\nare associated with high mean Nusselt values. The influence on heat transfer\nefficiency over the cylinder's surface is quantified via the calculation of\nmean Nusselt number and its fluctuation for different circumstances.

Any such\ndiscovery would shed light on many unresolved questions, particularly with\nregard to their possible formation mechanisms. To reveal bound features of\ndirectly imaged companions we need to suppress the contribution from the source\nitself. Therefore, we developed a method based on the negative fake companion\n(NEGFC) technique that first estimates the position in the field of view (FoV)\nand the flux of the imaged companion, then subtracts a rescaled model point\nspread function (PSF) from the imaged companion.

It\nalso suggests methods that can be used in the operation of ZENs to ensure\ncarbon neutrality. An optimization model for designing the energy system of a\nZero Emission Neighborhood (ZEN) is first presented and used to produce two\ndesigns for a campus in the South of Norway in the case where the amount of PV\nis limited (PVlim) and when it is not (Base). Several operation approaches are\nthen introduced to compare their operation cost and the CO2 emissions and\ncompensations. These approaches are perfect foresight used as a reference\n(Ref.),a purely economic model predictive control (E-MPC), an MPC with\npenalization if deviating from emission targets (EmE-MPC)and a receding horizon\nMPC where we have a net zero emission constraint over the year (RH-MPC). The\nresulting energy systems are, in the Base case, PV, heat pumps, a gas boiler\nand heat storage and, in the PVlim case, a smaller amount of PV, a CHP plant,\nand heat storage. In the Base case all operation strategies manage to reach net\nzero emissions, largely due to the passive compensations obtained from the PV.\nRH-MPC offers the lowest cost. In the PVlim case, the passive effect of the PV\nis not sufficient to reach net zero emissions and an operation approach\nspecifically taking into account the emissions is necessary. EmE-MPC achieves\nthe lowest emissions but it comes at a much higher cost. We conclude that the\nbest overall strategy is RH-MPC which maintains both the cost and the\nemission-compensation balance close to the reference case with perfect\nforesight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 13:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

In practical settings, there is often a need to deploy such\nRNNs on resource-constrained platforms such as mobile phones or embedded\ndevices. As the memory footprint and energy consumption of such components\nbecome a bottleneck, there is interest in compressing and optimizing such\nnetworks using a range of heuristic techniques. However, these techniques do\nnot guarantee the safety of the optimized network, e.g., against adversarial\ninputs, or equivalence of the optimized and original networks. To address this\nproblem, we propose DIFFRNN, the first differential verification method for\nRNNs to certify the equivalence of two structurally similar neural networks.\nExisting work on differential verification for ReLUbased feed-forward neural\nnetworks does not apply to RNNs where nonlinear activation functions such as\nSigmoid and Tanh cannot be avoided. RNNs also pose unique challenges such as\nhandling sequential inputs, complex feedback structures, and interactions\nbetween the gates and states. In DIFFRNN, we overcome these challenges by\nbounding nonlinear activation functions with linear constraints and then\nsolving constrained optimization problems to compute tight bounding boxes on\nnonlinear surfaces in a high-dimensional space. The soundness of these bounding\nboxes is then proved using the dReal SMT solver.

This variant was recently introduced by Chierichetti et\nal. [NeurIPS, 2017] in a seminal work and became widely popular in the\nclustering literature. In this paper, we propose a new construction of coresets\nfor fair clustering based on random sampling. The new construction allows us to\nobtain the first coreset for fair clustering in general metric spaces. For\nEuclidean spaces, we obtain the first coreset whose size does not depend\nexponentially on the dimension. Our coreset results solve open questions\nproposed by Schmidt et al. [WAOA, 2019] and Huang et al. [NeurIPS, 2019]. The\nnew coreset construction helps to design several new approximation and\nstreaming algorithms. In particular, we obtain the first true\nconstant-approximation algorithm for metric fair clustering, whose running time\nis fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). In the Euclidean case, we derive the first\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for fair clustering whose time\ncomplexity is near-linear and does not depend exponentially on the dimension of\nthe space. Besides, our coreset construction scheme is fairly general and gives\nrise to coresets for a wide range of constrained clustering problems. This\nleads to improved constant-approximations for these problems in general metrics\nand near-linear time $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximations in the Euclidean metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 14:15:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

Cosmological simulations suggest that these\nbaryons reside in filamentary gas structures, known as the warm-hot\nintergalactic medium (WHIM). As a result of the high temperatures of these\nfilaments, the matter is highly ionised such that it absorbs and emits far-UV\nand soft X-ray photons. Athena, the proposed European Space Agency X-ray\nobservatory, aims to detect the `missing' baryons in the WHIM up to redshifts\nof $z=1$ through absorption in active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray burst\nafterglow spectra, allowing for the study of the evolution of these large-scale\nstructures of the Universe. This work simulates WHIM filaments in the spectra\nof GRB X-ray afterglows with Athena using the SImulation of X-ray TElescopes\n(SIXTE) framework. We investigate the feasibility of their detection with the\nX-IFU instrument, through O VII ($E=573$ eV) and O VIII ($E=674$ eV) absorption\nfeatures, for a range of equivalent widths imprinted onto GRB afterglow spectra\nof observed starting fluxes ranging between $10^{-12}$ and $10^{-10}$ erg\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, in the 0.3-10 keV energy band.

However, a massive adoption of these apps is\nrequired to reach the critical mass needed for effective contact tracing. As an\nalternative, geo-location technologies in next generation networks (e.g., 5G)\ncan enable Mobile Operators (MOs) to perform passive tracing of users' mobility\nand contacts with a promised accuracy of down to one meter. To effectively\ndetect contagions, the identities of positive individuals, which are known only\nby a Governmental Authority (GA), are also required.

It uses genetic variants as instrumental\nvariables (IVs) to investigate putative causal relationship between an exposure\nand an outcome. Traditional MR methods have dominantly focussed on a two-sample\nsetting in which IV-exposure association study and IV-outcome association study\nare independent. However, it is not uncommon that participants from the two\nstudies fully overlap (one-sample) or partly overlap (overlapping-sample).\nMethods: We proposed a method that is applicable to all the three sample\nsettings. In essence, we converted a two- or overlapping- sample problem to a\none-sample problem where data of some or all of the individuals were\nincomplete. Assume that all individuals were drawn from the same population and\nunmeasured data were missing at random. Then the unobserved data were treated\nau pair with the model parameters as unknown quantities, and thus, could be\nimputed iteratively conditioning on the observed data and estimated parameters\nusing Markov chain Monte Carlo. We generalised our model to allow for\npleiotropy and multiple exposures and assessed its performance by a number of\nsimulations using four metrics: mean, standard deviation, coverage and power.\nResults: Higher sample overlapping rate and stronger instruments led to\nestimates with higher precision and power. Pleiotropy had a notably negative\nimpact on the estimates. Nevertheless, overall the coverages were high and our\nmodel performed well in all the sample settings. Conclusions: Our model offers\nthe flexibility of being applicable to any of the sample settings, which is an\nimportant addition to the MR literature which has restricted to one- or two-\nsample scenarios. Given the nature of Bayesian inference, it can be easily\nextended to more complex MR analysis in medical research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 15:18:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 14:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

Combining the\nmeasurements from spectroscopy and asteroseismology allows us to attain greater\naccuracy with regard to the stellar parameters needed to characterise the\nstellar populations of the Milky Way. The aim of this Gaia-ESO Survey special\nproject is to produce a catalogue of self-consistent stellar parameters by\ncombining measurements from high-resolution spectroscopy and precision\nasteroseismology. We carried out an iterative analysis of 90 K2@Gaia-ESO red\ngiants. The spectroscopic values of Teff were used as input in the seismic\nanalysis to obtain log(g) values. The seismic estimates of log(g) were then\nused to re-determine the spectroscopic values of Teff and [Fe/H]. Only one\niteration was required to obtain parameters that are in good agreement for both\nmethods and thus, to obtain the final stellar parameters. A detailed analysis\nof outliers was carried out to ensure a robust determination of the parameters.\nThe results were then combined with Gaia DR2 data to compare the seismic log(g)\nwith a parallax-based log(g) and to investigate instances of variations in the\nvelocity and possible binaries within the dataset. This analysis produced a\nhigh-quality catalogue of stellar parameters for 90 red giant stars observed by\nboth K2 and Gaia-ESO that were determined through iterations between\nspectroscopy and asteroseismology.

Mathematically, it is a simple numerical tool to compute a wide class\nof high-dimensional and oscillatory integrals. However, it is often observed\nthat the CL method converges but the limiting result is incorrect. The\nliterature has several unclear or even conflicting statements, making the\nmethod look mysterious. By an in-depth analysis of a model problem, we reveal\nthe mechanism of how the CL result turns biased as the parameter changes, and\nit is demonstrated that such a transition is difficult to capture. Our analysis\nalso shows that the method works for any observables only if the probability\ndensity function generated by the CL process is localized. To generalize such\nobservations to lattice field theories, we formulate the CL method on general\ngroups using rigorous mathematical languages for the first time, and we\ndemonstrate that such localized probability density function does not exist in\nthe simulation of lattice field theories for general compact groups, which\nexplains the unstable behavior of the CL method. Fortunately, we also find that\nthe gauge cooling technique creates additional velocity that helps confine the\nsamples, so that we can still see localized probability density functions in\ncertain cases, as significantly broadens the application of the CL method. The\nlimitations of gauge cooling are also discussed.

For\nheavier-than-fluid particles, having settling velocity of the order of the bed\nfriction velocity, the two-fluid model significantly under-estimates the\nturbulent dispersion of particles. It is hypothesized that finite-size effects\nare important and a correction model for the drag law is proposed. This model\nis based on the assumption that the turbulent flow scales larger than the\nparticle diameter will contribute to the resolved relative velocity between the\ntwo phases, whereas eddies smaller than the particle diameter will have two\neffects: (i) they will reduce the particle response time by adding a\nsub-particle scale eddy viscosity to the drag coefficient, and (ii) they will\ncontribute to increase the production of granular temperature. Integrating\nfinite-size effects allows us to quantitatively predict the concentration\nprofile for heavier-than-fluid particles without any tuning parameter. The\nproposed modification of the two-fluid model extends its range of applicability\nto tackle particles having a size belonging to the inertial range of turbulence\nand allows us to envision more complex applications in terms of flow forcing\nconditions, i.e. sheet flow, wave-driven transport, turbidity currents and/or\nflow geometries, i.e. ripples, dunes, scour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 15:34:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 13:37:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 17:34:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 13:57:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

Understanding what determines the Fermi surface size is a crucial\nand yet unsolved problem in strongly interacting systems such as high-$T_{c}$\nsuperconductors. Here we present a precise test of the Luttinger theorem for a\ntwo-dimensional Fermi liquid system where the exotic quasi-particles themselves\nemerge from the strong interaction, namely for the Fermi sea of composite\nfermions (CFs). Via direct, geometric resonance measurements of the CFs' Fermi\nwavevector down to very low electron densities, we show that the Luttinger\ntheorem is obeyed over a significant range of interaction strengths, in the\nsense that the Fermi sea area is determined by the density of the\n\\textit{minority carriers} in the lowest Landau level. Our data also address\nthe ongoing debates on whether or not CFs obey particle-hole symmetry, and if\nthey are Dirac particles.

The main operation of HD is encoding, which transfers\nthe input data to hyperspace by mapping each input feature to a hypervector,\naccompanied by so-called bundling procedure that simply adds up the\nhypervectors to realize encoding hypervector. Although the operations of HD are\nhighly parallelizable, the massive number of operations hampers the efficiency\nof HD in embedded domain. In this paper, we propose SHEARer, an\nalgorithm-hardware co-optimization to improve the performance and energy\nconsumption of HD computing. We gain insight from a prudent scheme of\napproximating the hypervectors that, thanks to inherent error resiliency of HD,\nhas minimal impact on accuracy while provides high prospect for hardware\noptimization. In contrast to previous works that generate the encoding\nhypervectors in full precision and then ex-post quantizing, we compute the\nencoding hypervectors in an approximate manner that saves a significant amount\nof resources yet affords high accuracy. We also propose a novel FPGA\nimplementation that achieves striking performance through massive parallelism\nwith low power consumption.

Our\nstudy exhibits a preliminary experiment that evaluates the performance of a\nmodel that downscales synoptic temperature fields to mesoscale temperature\nfields every 6 hours. The deep learning model was trained with operational\n22-km gridded global analysis surface winds and temperatures as the input,\noperational 5-km gridded regional analysis surface temperatures as the desired\noutput, and a target domain covering central Japan. The results confirm that\nour deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is capable of estimating the\nlocations of coastlines and mountain ridges in great detail, which are not\nretained in the inputs, and providing high-resolution surface temperature\ndistributions. For instance, while the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) is\n2.7 K between the global and regional analyses at altitudes greater than 1000\nm, the RMSE is reduced to 1.0 K, and the correlation coefficient is improved\nfrom 0.6 to 0.9 by the surrogate model. Although this study evaluates a\nsurrogate model only for surface temperature, it probably can be improved by\naugmenting the downscaling variables and vertical profiles.

Although the direction of the relationship is also negative\nfor the recession period, the coefficient is found to be insignificant. We also\nfind that the mentioned relationship may vary during the recession depending on\nthe size of the company. The impact of stock options on the dividend payout is\nnegative for medium-sized companies and the coefficient is both economically\nand statistically significant. The direction of impact changes for large-cap\ncompanies indicating to deterioration of the CEO voting power in those\ncompanies and less agency problem. We also determine that the percentage of\nshares held by the CEO has a positive impact on annual dividends distributed\nfor large-cap companies, whereas this relationship changes in times of\nrecession.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 20:00:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

However, these devices\nusually require inhomogeneous and extreme material parameters which are\ndifficult to realize in large-scale applications. Here, we demonstrate a\ngeneral process to design thermal harvesting devices with available natural\nmaterials through optimized composite microstructures. We apply two-scale\nhomogenization theory to obtain effective properties of the microstructures.\nOptimal Latin hypercube technique, combined with a genetic algorithm, is then\nimplemented on the microstructures to achieve optimized design parameters. The\noptimized microstructures can accurately approximate the behavior of\ntransformed materials. We design such devices and numerically characterize good\nthermal-energy harvesting performances. To validate the wide-range application\nof our approach, we illustrate other types of microstructures that mimic well\nthe constitutive parameters. The approach we propose can be used to design\nnovel thermal harvesting devices available with existing technology, and can\nalso act as a beneficial vehicle to explore other transformation optics enabled\ndesigns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 08:25:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-21"}

Among these newly-found 598,996 BBH orbits and\nsatellites, about 33.5 % (i.e., 200,686) are linearly stable and thus many\namong them might be observed in practice.
