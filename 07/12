For example,\nsome generators require knowledge of pre-softmax logits while others utilize\nprediction scores.\n  In this paper, we design a practical black-box adversarial example generator,\ndubbed ManiGen. ManiGen does not require any knowledge of the inner state of\nthe target classifier. It generates adversarial examples by searching along the\nmanifold, which is a concise representation of input data. Through extensive\nset of experiments on different datasets, we show that (1) adversarial examples\ngenerated by ManiGen can mislead standalone classifiers by being as successful\nas the state-of-the-art white-box generator, Carlini, and (2) adversarial\nexamples generated by ManiGen can more effectively attack classifiers with\nstate-of-the-art defenses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2020 17:34:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

However, inherent\nchallenges such as coverage and blockage of mmWave communication cause highly\nfluctuated channel quality. This paper explores wireless medium access control\n(MAC) schedulers for mmWave-based industrial wireless applications. Our\nobjective is to design a high-performance and enhanced fairness MAC scheduling\nalgorithm that responds rapidly to channel variations. The key contribution of\nour work is a method to modify the standard proportional fair (SPF) scheduler.\nIt introduces more flexibility and dynamic properties. Compared to the SPF, our\nenhanced proportional fair (EPF) scheduler not only improves the priority for\nusers in poor channel conditions but also accelerates the reaction time in\nfluctuated channel conditions. By providing higher fairness for all users and\nenhancing system robustness, it particularly adapts to the scatter-rich\nindustrial mmWave communication environment.

With object\ndetection being used pervasively in many security-critical applications, such\nas autonomous vehicles and smart cities, we argue that a holistic approach for\nan in-depth understanding of adversarial attacks and vulnerabilities of deep\nobject detection systems is of utmost importance for the research community to\ndevelop robust defense mechanisms.

One of the primary behavioral\ncauses, dietary intake, has proven particularly challenging to measure and\ntrack. Current behavioral science suggests that family eating dynamics (FED)\nhave high potential to impact child and parent dietary intake, and ultimately\nthe risk of obesity. Monitoring FED requires information about when and where\neating events are occurring, the presence or absence of family members during\neating events, and some person-level states such as stress, mood, and hunger.\nTo date, there exists no system for real-time monitoring of FED. This paper\npresents MFED, the first of its kind of system for monitoring FED in the wild\nin real-time. Smart wearables and Bluetooth beacons are used to monitor and\ndetect eating activities and the location of the users at home.

Meta-learning aims at exploiting prior experience and data to\nimprove performance on future tasks. By now, there exist numerous formulations\nfor meta-learning in the continuous domain.

Motivated by\nthis terminology, we propose a novel meta-learning framework in the discrete\ndomain where each task is equivalent to maximizing a set function under a\ncardinality constraint. Our approach aims at using prior data, i.e., previously\nvisited tasks, to train a proper initial solution set that can be quickly\nadapted to a new task at a relatively low computational cost. This approach\nleads to (i) a personalized solution for each individual task, and (ii)\nsignificantly reduced computational cost at test time compared to the case\nwhere the solution is fully optimized once the new task is revealed. The\ntraining procedure is performed by solving a challenging discrete optimization\nproblem for which we present deterministic and randomized algorithms. In the\ncase where the tasks are monotone and submodular, we show strong theoretical\nguarantees for our proposed methods even though the training objective may not\nbe submodular. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on two\nreal-world problem instances where we observe that our methods lead to a\nsignificant reduction in computational complexity in solving the new tasks\nwhile incurring a small performance loss compared to when the tasks are fully\noptimized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2020 21:02:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2021 00:39:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

The decision to bat first after winning the toss\nis often taken to make the best use of superior pitch conditions and set a big\ntarget for the opponent. However, the opponent may fail to show their natural\nbatting performance in the second innings due to a number of factors, including\ndeteriorated pitch conditions and excessive pressure of chasing a high target\nscore. The advantage of batting first has been highlighted in the literature\nand expert opinions, however, the effect of batting and bowling order on match\noutcome has not been investigated well enough to recommend a solution to any\npotential bias. This study proposes a probability theory-based model to study\nvenue-specific scoring and chasing characteristics of teams under different\nmatch outcomes. A total of 1117 one-day international matches held in ten\npopular venues are analyzed to show substantially high scoring advantage and\nlikelihood when the winning team bat in the first innings. Results suggest that\nthe same 'bat-first' winning team is very unlikely to score or chase such a\nhigh score if they were to bat in the second innings. Therefore, the coin toss\ndecision may favor one team over the other. A Bayesian model is proposed to\nrevise the target score for each venue such that the winning and scoring\nlikelihood is equal regardless of the toss decision. The data and source codes\nhave been shared publicly for future research in creating competitive match\noutcomes by eliminating the advantage of batting order in run scoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 03:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

In particular, autonomous connected vehicles require CI\nresources to operate, and, thus, communication failures can result in\nnon-optimality in the ITS flow in terms of traffic jams and fuel consumption.\nSimilarly, CI components, e.g., base stations (BSs) can be impacted by failures\nin the electric grid that is powering them. Thus, malicious attacks on the PG\ncan lead to failures in both the CI and the ITSs. To this end, in this paper,\nthe security of an ITS against indirect attacks carried out through the PG is\nstudied in an interdependent PG-CI-ITS scenario. To defend against such\nattacks, the administrator of the interdependent critical infrastructure can\nallocate backup power sources (BPSs) at every BS to compensate for the power\nloss caused by the attacker.

A\nfoot-controlled human-machine interface maps the natural foot gestures to the\n4-DoF movements of the endoscope, and two hand-controlled interfaces map the\nmovements of the two hands to the two instruments individually.

However, few effective self-supervised approaches\nexist for 3D action recognition, and directly applying SSL for semi-supervised\nlearning suffers from misalignment of representations learned from SSL and\nsupervised learning tasks. To address these issues, we present Adversarial\nSelf-Supervised Learning (ASSL), a novel framework that tightly couples SSL and\nthe semi-supervised scheme via neighbor relation exploration and adversarial\nlearning. Specifically, we design an effective SSL scheme to improve the\ndiscrimination capability of learned representations for 3D action recognition,\nthrough exploring the data relations within a neighborhood.

The success of deep neural network in denoising stimulates\nthe research of noise generation, aiming at synthesizing more clean-noisy image\npairs to facilitate the training of deep denoisers. In this work, we propose a\nnovel unified framework to simultaneously deal with the noise removal and noise\ngeneration tasks. Instead of only inferring the posteriori distribution of the\nlatent clean image conditioned on the observed noisy image in traditional MAP\nframework, our proposed method learns the joint distribution of the clean-noisy\nimage pairs. Specifically, we approximate the joint distribution with two\ndifferent factorized forms, which can be formulated as a denoiser mapping the\nnoisy image to the clean one and a generator mapping the clean image to the\nnoisy one. The learned joint distribution implicitly contains all the\ninformation between the noisy and clean images, avoiding the necessity of\nmanually designing the image priors and noise assumptions as traditional.\nBesides, the performance of our denoiser can be further improved by augmenting\nthe original training dataset with the learned generator. Moreover, we propose\ntwo metrics to assess the quality of the generated noisy image, for which, to\nthe best of our knowledge, such metrics are firstly proposed along this\nresearch line.

The higher deficiency algorithm (HDA) of Ji and\nFeinberg provided a method of determining the multistationarity capacity of a\nCRN with mass action kinetics (MAK). An extension of this, called\nMultistationarity Algorithm (MSA), recently came into the scene tackling CRNs\nwith power law kinetics (PLK), a kinetic system which is more general (having\nMAK systems as a special case). For this paper, we provide a computational\napproach to study the multistationarity feature of reaction networks endowed\nwith kinetics which are non-negative linear combinations of power law functions\ncalled poly-PL kinetics (PYK). The idea is to use MSA and combine it with a\ntransformation called STAR-MSC (i.e., $S$-invariant Termwise Addition of\nReactions via Maximal Stoichiometric Coefficients) producing PLKs that are\ndynamically equivalent to PYKs. This leads us to being able to determinine the\nmultistationarity capacity of a much larger class of kinetic systems. We show\nthat if the transformed dynamically equivalent PLK system is multistationary\nfor a stoichiometric class for a set of particular rate constants, then so is\nits original corresponding PYK system. Moreover, the monostationarity property\nof the transformed PLK system also implies the monostationarity property of the\noriginal PYK system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 09:35:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 12:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-20"}

The experiments were carried out using different configurations of the\nenvironment so that the presented module and the environment were compared with\nthe baselines. We reached similar policy optimization performance results with\nthe PrediNet architecture and MHDPA; additionally, we achieved to extract the\npropositional representation explicitly ---which makes the agent's statistical\npolicy logic more interpretable and tractable. This flexibility in the agent's\npolicy provides convenience for designing non-task-specific agent\narchitectures. The main contributions of this study are two-fold ---an RL agent\nthat can explicitly perform relational reasoning, and a new environment that\nmeasures the relational reasoning capabilities of RL agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 11:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

We propose and evaluate an adaptive guidance system\n(Cell-based Crowd Evacuation, CellEVAC) that dynamically allocates colors to\ncells in a cell-based pedestrian positioning infrastructure, to provide\nefficient exit-choice indications. The operational module of CellEVAC\nimplements an optimized discrete-choice model that integrates the influential\nfactors that would make evacuees adapt their exit choice. To optimize the\nmodel, we used a simulation-optimization modeling framework that integrates\nmicroscopic pedestrian simulation based on the classical Social Force Model. We\npaid particular attention to safety by using Pedestrian Fundamental Diagrams\nthat model the dynamics of the exit gates. CellEVAC has been tested in a\nsimulated real scenario (Madrid Arena) under different external pedestrian flow\npatterns that simulate complex pedestrian interactions. Results showed that\nCellEVAC outperforms evacuation processes in which the system is not used, with\nan exponential improvement as interactions become complex. We compared our\nsystem with an existing approach based on Cartesian Genetic Programming. Our\nsystem exhibited a better overall performance in terms of safety, evacuation\ntime, and the number of revisions of exit-choice decisions. Further analyses\nalso revealed that Cartesian Genetic Programming generates less natural\npedestrian reactions and movements than CellEVAC. The fact that the decision\nlogic module is built upon a behavioral model seems to favor a more natural and\neffective response. We also found that our proposal has a positive influence on\nevacuations even for a low compliance rate (40%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 11:37:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 06:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

While this task is\ncommon, more complex cases arise in practice---we are supposed to do the\ninverse thing by, for example, grouping similar users in a social network given\nthe labels of different communities. This triggers an interesting thought: can\nwe identify nodes given the labels of the graphs they belong to? Therefore,\nthis paper defines a novel problem dubbed Inverse Graph Identification (IGI),\nas opposed to GI. Upon a formal discussion of the variants of IGI, we choose a\nparticular case study of node clustering by making use of the graph labels and\nnode features, with an assistance of a hierarchical graph that further\ncharacterizes the connections between different graphs. To address this task,\nwe propose Gaussian Mixture Graph Convolutional Network (GMGCN), a simple yet\neffective method that makes the node-level message passing process using Graph\nAttention Network (GAT) under the protocol of GI and then infers the category\nof each node via a Gaussian Mixture Layer (GML). The training of GMGCN is\nfurther boosted by a proposed consensus loss to take advantage of the structure\nof the hierarchical graph. Extensive experiments are conducted to test the\nrationality of the formulation of IGI. We verify the superiority of the\nproposed method compared to other baselines on several benchmarks we have built\nup.

In this work, we deal with the Budgeted Maximum Coverage Problem\n(BMCP), which is a generalized 0-1 knapsack problem. Given a set of items with\nnonnegative weights and a set of elements with nonnegative profits, where each\nitem is composed of a subset of elements, BMCP aims to pack a subset of items\nin a capacity-constrained knapsack such that the total weight of the selected\nitems does not exceed the knapsack capacity, and the total profit of the\nassociated elements is maximized. Note that each element is counted once even\nif it is covered multiple times. BMCP is closely related to the Set-Union\nKnapsack Problem (SUKP) that is well studied in recent years. As the\ncounterpart problem of SUKP, however, BMCP was introduced early in 1999 but\nsince then it has been rarely studied, especially there is no practical\nalgorithm proposed. By combining the reinforcement learning technique to the\nlocal search procedure, we propose a probability learning based tabu search\n(PLTS) algorithm for addressing this NP-hard problem.

One group of\nparticipants performed the training only using the Wristbot, whereas for\nanother group the same physical assistance was attributed to the humanoid robot\niCub, who played the role of an expert trainer and exhibited also some social\nbehaviors. The results obtained show that participants of both groups\neffectively acquired the skill by leveraging the physical assistance, as they\nsignificantly improved their stabilization performance even when the assistance\nwas removed. Moreover, learning in a context of interaction with a humanoid\nrobot assistant led subjects to increased motivation and more enjoyable\ntraining experience, without negative effects on attention and perceived\neffort. With the experimental approach presented in this study, it is possible\nto investigate the relative contribution of haptic and social signals in the\ncontext of motor learning mediated by human-robot interaction, with the aim of\ndeveloping effective robot trainers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 12:46:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 15:51:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 13:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-02"}

In particular, the atom in the de Sitter universe\nexperiences thermal activation corresponding to the local temperature, which is\ntwice larger than the Hawking temperature, $T_{\\rm loc}=2T_{\\rm Hawking}$. The\nsame double Hawking temperature describes the decay of massive scalar field in\nthe de Sitter universe. The reason, why the local temperature is exactly twice\nthe Hawking temperature, follows from the geometry of the de Sitter spacetime.\nThe weakening of the role of the cosmological horizon in de Sitter universe is\nconfirmed by considering Hawking radiation. We discuss the difference between\nthe radiation of particles in the de Sitter spacetime and the Schwinger pair\ncreation in the electric field. We use the stationary Painleve-Gullstrand\nmetric for the de Sitter spacetime, where the particles are created by Hawking\nradiation from the cosmological horizon, and time independent gauge for the\nelectric field. In these stationary frames the Hamiltonians and the energy\nspectra of massive particles look rather similar. However, the final results\nare essentially different. In case of Schwinger pair production the number\ndensity of the created pairs grows with time, while in the de Sitter vacuum the\nnumber density of the created pairs is finite. The latter suggests that Hawking\nradiation from the cosmological horizon does not lead to instability of the de\nSitter vacuum. The other mechanisms of instability are required for the\ndynamical solution of the cosmological constant problem. We consider the\npossible role of the local temperature $T_{\\rm loc}=2T_{\\rm H}$ in the decay of\nthe de Sitter space-time due to the energy exchange between the vacuum energy\nand relativistic matter with this temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 13:37:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 15:01:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 13:12:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 09:26:03 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2020 11:11:30 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 09:34:34 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 12:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

Models are trained with 1879 composite surface soil samples, and 105\nauxiliary data as predictors. The genetic algorithm is used as a feature\nselection approach to identify effective variables. The results indicate that\nprecipitation is the most important predictor driving 15 percent of SOC spatial\nvariability followed by the normalized difference vegetation index, day\ntemperature index of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer,\nmultiresolution valley bottom flatness and land use, respectively. Based on 10\nfold cross validation, the DNN model reported as a superior algorithm with the\nlowest prediction error and uncertainty. In terms of accuracy, DNN yielded a\nmean absolute error of 59 percent, a root mean squared error of 75 percent, a\ncoefficient of determination of 0.65, and Lins concordance correlation\ncoefficient of 0.83. The SOC content was the highest in udic soil moisture\nregime class with mean values of 4 percent, followed by the aquic and xeric\nclasses, respectively. Soils in dense forestlands had the highest SOC contents,\nwhereas soils of younger geological age and alluvial fans had lower SOC. The\nproposed DNN is a promising algorithm for handling large numbers of auxiliary\ndata at a province scale, and due to its flexible structure and the ability to\nextract more information from the auxiliary data surrounding the sampled\nobservations, it had high accuracy for the prediction of the SOC baseline map\nand minimal uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 08:23:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-27"}

This paper explores the benefits of\nadding structure to weight priors. It initially considers first-layer filters\nof a convolutional NN, designing a prior based on random Gabor filters. Second,\nit considers adding structure to the prior of final-layer weights by estimating\nhow each hidden feature relates to each class. Empirical results suggest that\nthese structured weight priors lead to more meaningful functional priors for\nimage data. This contributes to the ongoing discussion on the importance of\nweight priors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 13:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

In such cases, there is no incentive in recovering the sample\nstate at different time steps like in time-resolved reconstruction methods, but\ninstead the goal is to retrieve a single reconstruction at the highest possible\nspatial resolution and without any imaging artifacts.

Projection data consistency is regulated by dense\noptical flow estimated by Farneback's algorithm, leading to sharp sample\nreconstructions with less artifacts.

Current prosthetic\nsystems use electromyography (EMG)-based techniques for creating functional\nsensorimotor platforms. This model sustains a sensorimotor platform for\nprosthesis users.
