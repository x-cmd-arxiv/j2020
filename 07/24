Due to limitation of hardware,\nit is often necessary to sacrifice accuracy to ensure the infer speed of the\ndetector in practice. Therefore, the balance between effectiveness and\nefficiency of object detector must be considered. The goal of this paper is to\nimplement an object detector with relatively balanced effectiveness and\nefficiency that can be directly applied in actual application scenarios, rather\nthan propose a novel detection model. Considering that YOLOv3 has been widely\nused in practice, we develop a new object detector based on YOLOv3. We mainly\ntry to combine various existing tricks that almost not increase the number of\nmodel parameters and FLOPs, to achieve the goal of improving the accuracy of\ndetector as much as possible while ensuring that the speed is almost unchanged.\nSince all experiments in this paper are conducted based on PaddlePaddle, we\ncall it PP-YOLO. By combining multiple tricks, PP-YOLO can achieve a better\nbalance between effectiveness (45.2% mAP) and efficiency (72.9 FPS), surpassing\nthe existing state-of-the-art detectors such as EfficientDet and YOLOv4.Source\ncode is at https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleDetection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 16:06:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 06:10:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 03:53:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

This may\nrequire considerable annotation cost in real-world applications. Fortunately,\nactive learning is a promising methodology to train high-performing model with\nminimal annotation cost. In the deep learning context, the critical question of\nactive learning is how to precisely identify the informativeness of samples for\nDNN. In this paper, inspired by piece-wise linear interpretability in DNN, we\nintroduce the linearly separable regions of samples to the problem of active\nlearning, and propose a novel Deep Active learning approach by Model\nInterpretability (DAMI). To keep the maximal representativeness of the entire\nunlabeled data, DAMI tries to select and label samples on different linearly\nseparable regions introduced by the piece-wise linear interpretability in DNN.\nWe focus on modeling Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) for modeling tabular data.\nSpecifically, we use the local piece-wise interpretation in MLP as the\nrepresentation of each sample, and directly run K-Center clustering to select\nand label samples.

Edge computing relies on a set of distributed processing nodes (i.e.\nvehicles) that are located close to the end user. In this paper, we consider a\nvehicular edge cloud (VEC) consisting of a set of vehicle clusters that form a\ntemporal vehicular cloud by combining their computational resources in the\ncluster. We tackle the problem of processing allocation in the proposed\nvehicular edge architecture by developing a Mixed Integer Linear Programming\n(MILP) optimization model that jointly minimizes power consumption, propagation\ndelay, and queuing delay. The results show that the closer the processing node\n(PN) is to the access point (AP), the lower the power consumption and delay, as\nthe distance and number of hops affect the propagation delay and queuing delay.\nHowever, the queuing delay at the AP becomes a limiting factor when it operates\nat a low service rate compared to the traffic arrival rate. Thus, processing\ntasks at the vehicular nodes (VN) was avoided whenever the objective function\nincluded queueing delay and the AP operated at a low service rate.

The\nexternal driving induces a rotating current due to vacuum polarization (in the\ninsulator phase) and to Schwinger effect (in the conductive phase). For some\nparticular values of the driving frequency the external field resonates with\nthe vector mesons of the model and a rotating current can be produced even in\nthe limit of vanishing driving field. These features are in common with the\n(3+1) dimensional setup based on the D3-D7 brane model and hint on some\ninteresting universality. We also compute the conductivities paying special\nattention to the photovoltaic induced Hall effect, which is only present for\nmassive charged carriers.

In this paper we propose a silhouette\nvectorization method which extracts the outline of a 2D shape from a raster\nbinary image, and converts it to a combination of cubic B\\'{e}zier polygons and\nperfect circles. Starting from the boundary curvature extrema computed at\nsub-pixel level, we identify a set of control points based on the affine\nscale-space induced by the outline. These control points capture similarity\ninvariant geometric features of the given silhouette and give precise locations\nof the shape's corners.of the given silhouette. Then, piecewise B\\'{e}zier\ncubics are computed by least-square fitting combined with an adaptive splitting\nto guarantee a predefined accuracy. When there are no curvature extrema\nidentified, either the outline is recognized as a circle using the\nisoperimetric inequality, or a pair of the most distant outline points are\nchosen to initiate the fitting. Given their construction, most of our control\npoints are geometrically stable under affine transformations.

Native ad CTR prediction is\nuseful for improving user experience and platform revenue. However, it is\nchallenging due to the lack of explicit user intent, and users' behaviors on\nthe platform with native ads may not be sufficient to infer their interest in\nads. Fortunately, user behaviors exist on many online platforms and they can\nprovide complementary information for user interest mining. Thus, leveraging\nmulti-platform user behaviors is useful for native ad CTR prediction. However,\nuser behaviors are highly privacy-sensitive and the behavior data on different\nplatforms cannot be directly aggregated due to user privacy concerns and data\nprotection regulations like GDPR. Existing CTR prediction methods usually\nrequire centralized storage of user behavior data for user modeling and cannot\nbe directly applied to the CTR prediction task with multi-platform user\nbehaviors. In this paper, we propose a federated native ad CTR prediction\nmethod named FedCTR, which can learn user interest representations from their\nbehaviors on multiple platforms in a privacy-preserving way. On each platform a\nlocal user model is used to learn user embeddings from the local user behaviors\non that platform. The local user embeddings from different platforms are\nuploaded to a server for aggregation, and the aggregated user embeddings are\nsent to the ad platform for CTR prediction. Besides, we apply LDP and DP\ntechniques to the local and aggregated user embeddings respectively for better\nprivacy protection. Moreover, we propose a federated framework for model\ntraining with distributed models and user behaviors. Extensive experiments on\nreal-world dataset show that FedCTR can effectively leverage multi-platform\nuser behaviors for native ad CTR prediction in a privacy-preserving manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 17:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-24"}

Age of information (AoI) is a fundamentally\nimportant metric to characterize information freshness, defined as the time\nelapsed since the generation of the last successfully received update. When\nmultiple devices share the same wireless channel to send updates to a common\nreceiver, an interesting question is whether dividing the whole channel into\nseveral subchannels will lead to better AoI performance. Given the same\nfrequency band, dividing it into different numbers of subchannels lead to\ndifferent transmission times and packet error rates (PER) of short update\npackets, thus affecting information freshness. We focus on a multichannel\naccess system where different devices take turns to transmit with a cyclic\nschedule repeated over time. We first derive the average AoI by estimating the\nPERs of short packets. Then we examine bounded AoI, for which the instantaneous\nAoI is required to be below a threshold a large percentage of the time.\nSimulation results indicate that multichannel access can provide low average\nAoI and uniform bounded AoI simultaneously across different received powers.\nOverall, our investigations provide insights into practical designs of\nmultichannel access systems with AoI requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 17:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Current hand-designed lane detection\nmethods are not robust enough to capture the curve lanes especially the remote\nparts due to the lack of modeling both long-range contextual information and\ndetailed curve trajectory. In this paper, we propose a novel lane-sensitive\narchitecture search framework named CurveLane-NAS to automatically capture both\nlong-ranged coherent and accurate short-range curve information while unifying\nboth architecture search and post-processing on curve lane predictions via\npoint blending. It consists of three search modules: a) a feature fusion search\nmodule to find a better fusion of the local and global context for multi-level\nhierarchy features; b) an elastic backbone search module to explore an\nefficient feature extractor with good semantics and latency; c) an adaptive\npoint blending module to search a multi-level post-processing refinement\nstrategy to combine multi-scale head prediction. The unified framework ensures\nlane-sensitive predictions by the mutual guidance between NAS and adaptive\npoint blending. Furthermore, we also steer forward to release a more\nchallenging benchmark named CurveLanes for addressing the most difficult curve\nlanes. It consists of 150K images with 680K labels.The new dataset can be\ndownloaded at github.com/xbjxh/CurveLanes (already anonymized for this\nsubmission).

Prior work has\nanalyzed the effects of these operators on genotypic variation, often using\nlocality metrics that measure the sensitivity and stability of\ngenotype-phenotype representations to these operators.\n  In this paper, we focus on an important subset of representations, namely\nnonredundant bitstring-to-integer representations, and analyze them through the\nlens of Rothlauf's widely used locality metrics. We first define locality\nmetrics equivalent to Rothlauf's that are tailored to our domain: the\n\\textit{point locality} for single-bit mutation and \\textit{general locality}\nfor recombination. With these definitions, we derive tight bounds and a closed\nform expected value for point locality. For general locality we show that it is\nasymptotically equivalent across all representations and operators. We also\nrecreate three established GEA experiments to understand the predictive power\nof point locality on GEA performance, focusing on two popular and often\njuxtaposed representations: standard binary and binary reflected Gray.\n  We show that standard binary has provably no worse locality than any Gray\nencoding, including binary reflected Gray. We discuss this result in the\ncontext of previous studies that found binary reflected Gray to outperform\nstandard binary, and we argue that locality cannot be the explanation for\nstrong performance.

Spectroscopic redshifts for the dim and numerous galaxies\nof next-generation weak-lensing surveys are expected to be unavailable, making\nphotometric redshift (photo-$z$) probability density functions (PDFs) the\nnext-best alternative for comprehensively encapsulating the nontrivial\nsystematics affecting photo-$z$ point estimation. The established stacked\nestimator of $n(z)$ avoids reducing photo-$z$ PDFs to point estimates but\nyields a systematically biased estimate of $n(z)$ that worsens with decreasing\nsignal-to-noise, the very regime where photo-$z$ PDFs are most necessary.

Compared to that in the solar vicinity, the high-$\\alpha$\npopulation in the bulge peaks at a lower [Fe/H]. To fit these observations, we\nuse a simple but flexible star formation framework, which assumes two distinct\nstages of gas accretion and star formation, and systematically evaluate a wide\nmulti-dimensional parameter space. We find that the data favor a three-phase\nSFH that consists of an initial starburst, followed by a rapid star formation\nquenching episode and a lengthy, quiescent secular evolution phase. The\nmetal-poor, high-$\\alpha$ bulge stars ([Fe/H]<0.0 and [Mg/Fe]>0.15) are formed\nrapidly (<2 Gyr) during the early starburst. The density gap between the high-\nand low-$\\alpha$ sequences is due to the quenching process. The metal-rich,\nlow-$\\alpha$ population ([Fe/H]>0.0 and [Mg/Fe]<0.15) then accumulates\ngradually through inefficient star formation during the secular phase. This is\nqualitatively consistent with the early SFH of the inner disk. Given this\nscenario, a notable fraction of young stars (age<5 Gyr) is expected to persist\nin the bulge.

The growth of SMBHs is modelled in\npost-processing with different black hole accretion models, placements, and\nmerger treatments, and validated by comparing to on-the-fly calculations.\nScaling relations predicted by the gravitational torque driven accretion (GTDA)\nmodel agree with observations at low redshift without the need for AGN\nfeedback, in contrast to models in which the accretion rate depends strongly on\nSMBH mass. At high redshift, we find deviations from the local scaling\nrelations in line with previous theoretical results.

However, the primary mechanism for generating\nluminosity during the flares remains debated. Despite the increasing number of\nobserved TDEs, it is unclear whether most of the energy in the initial flare\ncomes from accretion near the gravitational radius or from circularizing debris\nat larger distances from the SMBH. The energy dissipation efficiency increases\nwith decreasing radii, therefore by measuring the total energy emitted and\nestimating the efficiency we can derive clues about the nature of the emission\nmechanism. Here we calculate the integrated energy, emission timescales, and\naverage efficiencies for the TDEs using the Modular Open Source Fitter for\nTransients ({\\tt MOSFiT}). Our calculations of the total energy generally yield\nhigher values than previous estimates. This is predominantly because, if the\nluminosity follows the mass fallback rate, TDEs release a significant fraction\nof their energy long after their light curve peaks. We use {\\tt MOSFiT} to\ncalculate the conversion efficiency from mass to radiated energy, and find that\nfor many of the events it is similar to efficiencies inferred for active\ngalactic nuclei. There are, however, large systematic uncertainties in the\nmeasured efficiency due to model degeneracies between the efficiency and the\nmass of the disrupted star, and these must be reduced before we can\ndefinitively resolve the emission mechanism of individual TDEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 18:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

So far, the only quantum degenerate gas of\nmolecules has been created via association of two highly degenerate atomic\ngases. Here, we use an external electric field along with optical lattice\nconfinement to create a two-dimensional (2D) Fermi gas of spin-polarized\npotassium-rubidium (KRb) polar molecules, where elastic, tunable dipolar\ninteractions dominate over all inelastic processes. Direct thermalization among\nthe molecules in the trap leads to efficient dipolar evaporative cooling,\nyielding a rapid increase in phase-space density. At the onset of quantum\ndegeneracy, we observe the effects of Fermi statistics on the thermodynamics of\nthe molecular gas.

This is the second component of a two-part\ninvestigation of the kinetics and fluctuation dynamics of self-organized\nnanoscale ripple development on silicon during 1 keV Ar$^+$ (Part I) and Kr$^+$\nbombardment. Here, it's found that the ion-enhanced viscous flow relaxation is\nessentially equal for Kr$^+$-induced patterning as previously found for Ar$^+$\npatterning. The magnitude of the surface curvature dependent roughening rate in\nthe early stage kinetics is larger for Kr$^+$ than for Ar$^+$, qualitatively\nconsistent with expectations for erosive and mass redistributive contributions\nto the initial surface instability. As with the Ar$^+$ case, fluctuation\ndynamics in the late stage show a peak in correlation time at the length scale\ncorresponding to the dominant structural feature on the surface -- the ripples.\nAnalogy is made to the phenomenon of de Gennes narrowing in liquids, but\nsignificant differences are also pointed out. Finally, it's shown that speckle\nmotion during the surface evolution can be analyzed to determine spatial\ninhomogeneities in erosion rate and ripple velocity on the surface. This allows\nthe direction and speed of ripple motion to be measured in real time, a unique\ncapability for measuring these fundamental parameters outside the specialized\nenvironment of FIB/SEM systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 23:27:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 16:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

The analysis shows that observed R(Br$\\gamma$)\nratios reach only values up to 0.3 when the slit encompasses the entire nebula.\nValues higher than that are only obtained when the slit covers a limited region\naround the H$_2$ peak emission and the Br$\\gamma$ emission is then minimised.\nThe numerical simulations presented show that, when the effect of the slit\nconfiguration is taken into account, photoionization models can reproduce the\nwhole range of observed R(Br$\\gamma$) in PNe, as well as the behaviour\ndescribed above. The argument that shocks are needed to explain the higher\nvalues of R(Br$\\gamma$) is thus not valid. Therefore, this ratio is not a good\nindicator of the H$_2$ excitation mechanism as suggested in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 01:05:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-27"}

Recent\ndevelopments in KT using flexible deep neural network-based models excel at\nthis task. However, these models often offer limited interpretability, thus\nmaking them insufficient for personalized learning, which requires using\ninterpretable feedback and actionable recommendations to help learners achieve\nbetter learning outcomes. In this paper, we propose attentive knowledge tracing\n(AKT), which couples flexible attention-based neural network models with a\nseries of novel, interpretable model components inspired by cognitive and\npsychometric models. AKT uses a novel monotonic attention mechanism that\nrelates a learner's future responses to assessment questions to their past\nresponses; attention weights are computed using exponential decay and a\ncontext-aware relative distance measure, in addition to the similarity between\nquestions. Moreover, we use the Rasch model to regularize the concept and\nquestion embeddings; these embeddings are able to capture individual\ndifferences among questions on the same concept without using an excessive\nnumber of parameters. We conduct experiments on several real-world benchmark\ndatasets and show that AKT outperforms existing KT methods (by up to $6\\%$ in\nAUC in some cases) on predicting future learner responses.

Although APT activities are stealthy, they interact\nwith the system components and these interactions lead to information flows.\nDynamic Information Flow Tracking (DIFT) has been proposed as one of the\neffective ways to detect APTs using the information flows. However, wide range\nsecurity analysis using DIFT results in a significant increase in performance\noverhead and high rates of false-positives and false-negatives generated by\nDIFT. In this paper, we model the strategic interaction between APT and DIFT as\na non-cooperative stochastic game. The game unfolds on a state space\nconstructed from an information flow graph (IFG) that is extracted from the\nsystem log. The objective of the APT in the game is to choose transitions in\nthe IFG to find an optimal path in the IFG from an entry point of the attack to\nan attack target. On the other hand, the objective of DIFT is to dynamically\nselect nodes in the IFG to perform security analysis for detecting APT. Our\ngame model has imperfect information as the players do not have information\nabout the actions of the opponent. We consider two scenarios of the game (i)\nwhen the false-positive and false-negative rates are known to both players and\n(ii) when the false-positive and false-negative rates are unknown to both\nplayers.

Recently, another dimension of\nadversarial attack, namely, attack on DNN weight parameters, has been shown to\nbe very powerful. As a representative one, the Bit-Flip-based adversarial\nweight Attack (BFA) injects an extremely small amount of faults into weight\nparameters to hijack the executing DNN function. Prior works of BFA focus on\nun-targeted attack that can hack all inputs into a random output class by\nflipping a very small number of weight bits stored in computer memory. This\npaper proposes the first work of targeted BFA based (T-BFA) adversarial weight\nattack on DNNs, which can intentionally mislead selected inputs to a target\noutput class. The objective is achieved by identifying the weight bits that are\nhighly associated with classification of a targeted output through a\nclass-dependent weight bit ranking algorithm.

For example, by merely flipping 27 out of 88 million\nweight bits of ResNet-18, our T-BFA can misclassify all the images from 'Hen'\nclass into 'Goose' class (i.e., 100 % attack success rate) in ImageNet dataset,\nwhile maintaining 59.35 % validation accuracy.

To overcome these obstacles, we\ncontribute a large-scale face anti-spoofing dataset, CelebA-Spoof, with the\nfollowing appealing properties: 1) Quantity: CelebA-Spoof comprises of 625,537\npictures of 10,177 subjects, significantly larger than the existing datasets.\n2) Diversity: The spoof images are captured from 8 scenes (2 environments * 4\nillumination conditions) with more than 10 sensors. 3) Annotation Richness:\nCelebA-Spoof contains 10 spoof type annotations, as well as the 40 attribute\nannotations inherited from the original CelebA dataset. Equipped with\nCelebA-Spoof, we carefully benchmark existing methods in a unified multi-task\nframework, Auxiliary Information Embedding Network (AENet), and reveal several\nvaluable observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 04:28:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 08:52:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2020 07:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

A system of self-propelling micron\nsized 4-pentyl-4-biphenylcarbonitrile (5CB) droplets in an aqueous solution of\ntetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) as surfactant is considered. It is\nshown that addition of glycerol causes the active 5CB droplet to exhibit a\ntransition from smooth to jittery motion. The motion is found to be independent\nof the droplet size and the nematic state of 5CB. Analogous experiments with\nPolyacrylamide (PAAm), Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA),\nas solutes confirm that such a transition cannot merely be explained solely\nbased on the viscosity or Peclet number of the system. We propose that the\nspecific nature of physicochemical interactions between the solute and the\ndroplet interface is at the root of this transition. The experiments show that\nthe time-scales associated with the influx and redistribution of surfactants at\nthe interface are altered in the presence of solutes. Glycerol and PVP\nsignificantly enhance the rate of solubilization of the 5CB droplets resulting\nin a quicker re-distribution of the adsorbed TTAB molecules on the interface,\ncausing the droplet to momentarily stop and then restart in an independent\ndirection. On the other hand, low solubilization rates in the presence of PAAm\nand PVA lead to smooth trajectories. Our hypothesis is supported by the time\nevolution of droplet size and interfacial velocity measurements in the presence\nand absence of solute. Overall, our results provide fundamental insights into\nthe complex interactions emerging due to the presence of solutes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 04:29:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 17:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

While classical MoE's pick expert\ntowers spontaneously for each input example, we explore two techniques to\nestablish more explicit and transparent connections between the experts and\nquery categories. To help differentiate experts on their domain specialties, we\nintroduce a form of adversarial regularization among the expert outputs,\nforcing them to disagree with one another. As a result, they tend to approach\neach prediction problem from different angles, rather than copying one another.\nThis is validated by a much stronger clustering effect of the gate output\nvectors under different categories.

Furthermore,\nwe apply AntLer to a nonlinear system, which yields better results compared to\nthe case where learning is not anticipated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 07:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-27"}

Ir is for instance used as a spacer layer\nfor perpendicular synthetic antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnet systems.

In this paper, we present inverse spin Hall effect - spin pumping\nferromagnetic resonance measurements on CoFeB/Ir based bilayers to estimate the\nvalues of the effective spin Hall angle, the spin diffusion length within\niridium, and the spin mixing conductance in the CoFeB/Ir bilayer. In order to\nhave reliable results, we performed the same experiments on CoFeB/Pt bilayers,\nwhich behavior is well known due to numerous reported studies. Our experimental\nresults show that the spin diffusion length within iridium is 1.3 nm for\nresistivity of 250 n$\\Omega$.m, the spin mixing conductance $g_{eff}^{\\uparrow\n\\downarrow}$ of the CoFeB/Ir interface is 30 nm$^{-2}$, and the spin Hall angle\nof iridium has the same sign than the one of platinum and is evaluated at 26%\nof the one of platinum. The value of the spin Hall angle found is 7.7% for Pt\nand 2% for Ir. These relevant parameters shall be useful to consider Ir in new\nconcepts and devices combining spin-orbit torque and spin-transfer torque.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 09:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

Analyzing the coupling of a non-symmetry-breaking electronic\ninstability, responsible for volume strain, to symmetry-breaking phenomena is\nof importance for many systems in nature and here we show that the\nsymmetry-allowed qh2 coupling plays a central role.

Previous works sought to\ndefine metrics over the feature matrices to measure the difference between two\nmodels. However, different metrics sometimes lead to contradictory conclusions,\nand there has been no consensus on which metric is suitable to use in practice.\nIn this work, we propose a novel metric that goes beyond previous approaches.\nRecall that one of the most practical scenarios of using the learned\nrepresentations is to apply them to downstream tasks. We argue that we should\ndesign the metric based on a similar principle. For that, we introduce the\ntransferred discrepancy (TD), a new metric that defines the difference between\ntwo representations based on their downstream-task performance. Through an\nasymptotic analysis, we show how TD correlates with downstream tasks and the\nnecessity to define metrics in such a task-dependent fashion. In particular, we\nalso show that under specific conditions, the TD metric is closely related to\nprevious metrics. Our experiments show that TD can provide fine-grained\ninformation for varied downstream tasks, and for the models trained from\ndifferent initializations, the learned features are not the same in terms of\ndownstream-task predictions. We find that TD may also be used to evaluate the\neffectiveness of different training strategies. For example, we demonstrate\nthat the models trained with proper data augmentations that improve the\ngeneralization capture more similar features in terms of TD, while those with\ndata augmentations that hurt the generalization will not. This suggests a\ntraining strategy that leads to more robust representation also trains models\nthat generalize better.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 10:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-27"}

The network consists of a joint object and edge detection\nnetwork and a crisp edge refinement network, which predicts more accurate,\nclearer and thinner high quality binary edge maps without any post-processing.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on the 2D nuclei images from Kaggle 2018\nData Science Bowl and a private 3D microscopy images of a monkey brain, which\nshow outstanding performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 11:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-27"}

We show that, by coupling two Rydberg\nstates with a microwave field (microwave dressing), the nonlocal Kerr\nnonlinearity of the Rydberg gas can be enhanced significantly and may be tuned\nactively. Based on such nonlocal Kerr nonlinearity, we demonstrate that a\nplane-wave state of probe laser field can undergo a modulation instability (MI)\nand hence spontaneous symmetry breaking, which may result in the emergence of\nvarious self-organized optical patterns. Especially, we find that a hexagonal\nlattice pattern (which is the only optical pattern when the microwave dressing\nis absent) may develop into several types of square lattice ones when the\nmicrowave dressing is applied; moreover, as a outcome of the MI the formation\nof nonlocal optical solitons is also possible in the system.

We investigate the coupled thermal-orbital evolution\nof differentiated rocky exoplanets governed by the Andrade viscoelastic\nrheology. The coupled evolution is treated by a semi-analytical model, 1d\nparametrized heat transfer and self-consistently calculated tidal dissipation.\nFirst, we conduct several parametric studies, exploring the effect of the\nrheological properties, the planet's size, and the orbital eccentricity on the\ntidal locking and dissipation.

It\nenables the sender to disclose information to the receiver in a way as to\nincentivize her to take an action that is preferred by the sender. Finding the\noptimal signaling scheme is known to be computationally difficult in general.\nThis hardness is further exacerbated when there is also a constraint on the\nsize of the message space, leading to NP-hardness of approximating the optimal\nsender utility within any constant factor.\n  In this paper, we show that in several natural and prominent cases the\noptimization problem is tractable even when the message space is limited. In\nparticular, we study signaling under a symmetry or an independence assumption\non the distribution of utility values for the actions.

However, for fermions, these simulations are\nhampered by the sign problem that prohibits simulations in the regime of strong\ndegeneracy. The situation changed with the development of configuration path\nintegral Monte Carlo (CPIMC) by Schoof \\textit{et al.} [T. Schoof \\textit{et\nal.}, Contrib. Plasma Phys. \\textbf{51}, 687 (2011)] that allowed for the first\n\\textit{ab initio} simulations for dense quantum plasmas. CPIMC also has a sign\nproblem that occurs when the density is lowered, i.e. in a parameter range that\nis complementary to traditional QMC formulated in coordinate space. Thus, CPIMC\nsimulations for the warm dense electron gas are limited to small values of the\nBrueckner parameter -- the ratio of the interparticle distance to the Bohr\nradius -- $r_s=\\bar{r}/a_B \\lesssim 1$. In order to reach the regime of\nstronger coupling (lower density) with CPIMC, here we investigate additional\nrestrictions on the Monte Carlo procedure. In particular, we introduce two\ndifferent versions of \"restricted CPIMC\" where certain sign changing Monte\nCarlo updates are being omitted.

We first\nintroduce the Socially Appropriate Domestic Robot Actions dataset (MANNERS-DB),\nwhich contains appropriateness labels of robot actions annotated by humans. To\nbe able to control but vary the configurations of the scenes and the social\nsettings, MANNERS-DB has been created utilising a simulation environment by\nuniformly sampling relevant contextual attributes. Secondly, we train and\nevaluate a baseline Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) that estimates social\nappropriateness of actions in the MANNERS-DB. Finally, we formulate learning\nsocial appropriateness of actions as a continual learning problem using the\nuncertainty of the BNN parameters. The experimental results show that the\nsocial appropriateness of robot actions can be predicted with a satisfactory\nlevel of precision. Our work takes robots one step closer to a human-like\nunderstanding of (social) appropriateness of actions, with respect to the\nsocial context they operate in.

Here, we address this difficulty by\nintroducing a steady-state description of photodoped Mott insulators using an\nopen-system setup, where the photodoped system is stabilized as a\nnon-equilirium steady-state (NESS) by a weak external driving. Taking advantage\nof the stationarity, we implement and discuss the details of an efficient\nnumerical tool using the steady-state Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT),\ncombined with the non-crossing approximation (NCA). We demonstrate that these\nstationary photodoped states exhibit the same properties of their transient\ncounterparts, while being solvable with reasonable computational efforts.\nFurthermore, they can be parametrized by just few physical quantities,\nincluding the effective temperature and the density of charge excitations,\nwhich confirms the universal nature of photodoped states indeed independent of\nthe excitation protocols. As a first application, we consider the stationary\nphotodoped states in a two-band Hubbard model with intertwined spin-and-orbital\nordering and find a family of hidden phases unknown from the previous studies,\nimplying an apparently unexplored time regime of the relaxation of the\nintertwined orders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 13:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

It is necessary to conduct an initial screening of patients with\nthe symptoms of COVID-19 disease to control the spread of the disease.

Some studies proposed CT scan or chest\nX-ray images as an alternative solution. Therefore, it is essential to use\nevery available resource, instead of either a CT scan or chest X-ray to conduct\na large number of tests simultaneously. As a result, this study aims to develop\na deep learning-based model that can detect COVID-19 patients with better\naccuracy both on CT scan and chest X-ray image dataset. In this work, eight\ndifferent deep learning approaches such as VGG16, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50,\nDenseNet201, VGG19, MobilenetV2, NasNetMobile, and ResNet15V2 have been tested\non two dataset-one dataset includes 400 CT scan images, and another dataset\nincludes 400 chest X-ray images studied.

In\nthis work we prove existence and uniqueness of rigidly (slowly) rotating fluid\nbodies in equilibrium to second order in perturbation theory in GR. The most\nwidely used perturbation framework to describe slowly rigidly rotating stars in\nthe strong field regime is the Hartle-Thorne model.

Can we go\nfurther and adapt the gesturing style to follow a specific speaker? Gestures\nthat are naturally timed with corresponding speech during human communication\nare called co-speech gestures. A key challenge, called gesture style transfer,\nis to learn a model that generates these gestures for a speaking agent 'A' in\nthe gesturing style of a target speaker 'B'. A secondary goal is to\nsimultaneously learn to generate co-speech gestures for multiple speakers while\nremembering what is unique about each speaker. We call this challenge style\npreservation. In this paper, we propose a new model, named Mix-StAGE, which\ntrains a single model for multiple speakers while learning unique style\nembeddings for each speaker's gestures in an end-to-end manner. A novelty of\nMix-StAGE is to learn a mixture of generative models which allows for\nconditioning on the unique gesture style of each speaker. As Mix-StAGE\ndisentangles style and content of gestures, gesturing styles for the same input\nspeech can be altered by simply switching the style embeddings. Mix-StAGE also\nallows for style preservation when learning simultaneously from multiple\nspeakers.

However, mass EV adoption also means a spike in load\n(kW), which in turn can disrupt existing electricity infrastructure. Smart or\ncontrolled charging is widely seen as a potential solution to alleviate this\nstress on existing networks. Learning from the recent EV trials in the UK and\nelsewhere we take into account two key aspects which are largely ignored in\ncurrent research: EVs actually charging at any given time and wide range of EV\ntypes, especially battery capacity-wise. Taking a minimalistic scenario-based\napproach, we study forecasting models for mean number of active chargers and\nmean EV consumption for distinct scenarios. Focusing on residential charging\nthe models we consider range from simple regression models to more advanced\nmachine and deep learning models such as XGBoost and LSTMs. We then use these\nmodels to evaluate the impacts of different levels of future EV penetration on\na specimen distribution transformer that captures typical real-world scenarios.\nIn doing so, we also initiate the study of different types of controlled\ncharging when fully controlled charging is not possible. This aligns with the\noutcomes from recent trials which show that a sizeable proportion of EV owners\nmay not prefer fully controlled centralized charging. We study two possible\ncontrol regimes and show that one is more beneficial from load-on-transformer\npoint of view, while the other may be preferred for other objectives. We show\nthat a minimum of 60% control is required to ensure that transformers are not\noverloaded during peak hours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 08:37:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 14:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

In particular, a mmWave transmitter, referred to as\nAlice, attempts to reliably communicate to a receiver, referred to as Bob,\nwhile hiding the existence of communication from a warden, referred to as\nWillie.\n  In this regard, operating over the mmWave bands not only increases the\ncovertness thanks to directional beams, but also increases the transmission\ndata rates given much more available bandwidths and enables ultra-low form\nfactor transceivers due to the lower wavelengths used compared to the\nconventional radio frequency (RF) counterpart. We first assume that the\ntransmitter Alice employs two independent antenna arrays in which one of the\narrays is to form a directive beam for data transmission to Bob. The other\nantenna array is used by Alice to generate another beam toward Willie as a\njamming signal while changing the transmit power independently across the\ntransmission blocks in order to achieve the desired covertness. For this\ndual-beam setup, we characterize Willie's detection error rate with the optimal\ndetector and the closed-form of its expected value from Alice's perspective. We\nthen derive the closed-form expression for the outage probability of the\nAlice-Bob link, which enables characterizing the optimal covert rate that can\nbe achieved using the proposed setup. We further obtain tractable forms for the\nergodic capacity of the Alice-Bob link involving only one-dimensional integrals\nthat can be computed in closed forms for most ranges of the channel parameters.\nFinally, we highlight how the results can be extended to more practical\nscenarios, particularly to the cases where perfect information about the\nlocation of the passive warden is not available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 04:22:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 23:39:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Although\na wide variety of designs and implementations have been presented within the\nfield of rescue robotics, embedding all mobility, dexterity, and reconnaissance\ncapabilities in a single robot remains a challenging problem. This paper\nexplains the design and implementation of Karo, a mobile robot that exhibits a\nhigh degree of mobility at the side of maintaining required dexterity and\nexploration capabilities for urban search and rescue (USAR) missions. We first\nelicit the system requirements of a standard rescue robot from the frameworks\nof Rescue Robot League (RRL) of RoboCup and then, propose the conceptual design\nof Karo by drafting a locomotion and manipulation system. Considering that,\nthis work presents comprehensive design processes along with detail mechanical\ndesign of the robot's platform and its 7-DOF manipulator. Further, we present\nthe design and implementation of the command and control system by discussing\nthe robot's power system, sensors, and hardware systems. In conjunction with\nthis, we elucidate the way that Karo's software system and human-robot\ninterface are implemented and employed. Furthermore, we undertake extensive\nevaluations of Karo's field performance to investigate whether the principal\nobjective of this work has been satisfied. We demonstrate that Karo has\neffectively accomplished assigned standardized rescue operations by evaluating\nall aspects of its capabilities in both RRL's test suites and training suites\nof a fire department. Finally, the comprehensiveness of Karo's capabilities has\nbeen verified by drawing quantitative comparisons between Karo's performance\nand other leading robots participating in RRL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 22:02:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2021 06:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

Experimental quantum capabilities are realized by producing\nsingle photons (using spontaneous parametric down-conversion process),\npolarization of photons, detecting vertical and horizontal polarizations, and\nsingle photon detecting/counting.

The modeled\nresponse of diffuse reflectance in the CIAD geometry was examined with phantoms\nby altering independently the size of the collection geometry and the reduced\nscattering and absorption properties of the medium. When applied to aqueous\nturbid medium containing glucose control solutions with the cumulative volume\nvarying over three orders of magnitude, a linear relationship expected for the\ndiffuse reflectance as a function of the medium absorption/reduced-scattering\nproperty was observed for four conditions of the glucose-medium composition\nthat differed either in the effective glucose concentration or the host medium\nscattering property.
