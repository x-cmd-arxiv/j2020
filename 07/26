A key challenge in providing\nthis capability is the requirement for judicious management of the\nheterogeneous communication and computation resources that exist at the edge to\nmeet processing needs. In this paper, we develop an optimization methodology\nthat considers the network topology jointly with device and network resource\nallocation to minimize total D2D overhead, which we quantify in terms of time\nand energy required for task processing. Variables in our model include task\nassignment, CPU allocation, subchannel selection, and beamforming design for\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless devices. We propose two methods\nto solve the resulting non-convex mixed integer program: semi-exhaustive search\noptimization, which represents a \"best-effort\" at obtaining the optimal\nsolution, and efficient alternate optimization, which is more computationally\nefficient. As a component of these two methods, we develop a novel coordinated\nbeamforming algorithm which we show obtains the optimal beamformer for a common\nreceiver characteristic. Through numerical experiments, we find that our\nmethodology yields substantial improvements in network overhead compared with\nlocal computation and partially optimized methods, which validates our joint\noptimization approach. Further, we find that the efficient alternate\noptimization scales well with the number of nodes, and thus can be a practical\nsolution for D2D computing in large networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 16:01:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 20:57:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 17:10:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 13:51:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 13:34:43 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 13:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

[MNRAS 480, L58 (2018)] and Liu and Lai [ApJ 863, 68 (2018)], yet allowing\nthe spins to have random initial orientations.

We generalize the effective potential\ntheory to include orbital eccentricity, which allows us to efficiently evolve\nthe system in the early inspiral stages. We further find that the spin-spin and\nspin-orbit alignments are correlated and the correlation is determined by the\ninitial spin-orbit angle.

Compared to previous\nnon-learning approaches, our proposed method gains competitive advantages by\nleveraging the power of deep neural networks to effectively and efficiently\nlearn to align a large number of highly deformed 3D shapes with superior\nperformance. Unlike most learning-based methods that use an explicit feature\nencoding network to extract the per-shape features and their correlations, our\nmodel leverages a model-free learnable latent descriptor to characterize the\ngroup relationship. More specifically, for a given group we first define an\noptimizable Group Latent Descriptor (GLD) to characterize the gruopwise\nrelationship among a group of point sets. Each GLD is randomly initialized from\na Gaussian distribution and then concatenated with the coordinates of each\npoint of the associated point sets in the group. A neural network-based decoder\nis further constructed to predict the coherent drifts as the desired\ntransformation from input groups of shapes to aligned groups of shapes. During\nthe optimization process, GP-Aligner jointly updates all GLDs and weight\nparameters of the decoder network towards the minimization of an unsupervised\ngroupwise alignment loss. After optimization, for each group our model\ncoherently drives each point set towards a middle, common position (shape)\nwithout specifying one as the target. GP-Aligner does not require large-scale\ntraining data for network training and it can directly align groups of point\nsets in a one-stage optimization process.

Electron transfer is fundamentally\ndifferent and occurs by tunneling in response to solvent fluctuations. Here, we\ndevelop the theory of coupled ion-electron transfer, in which ions and solvent\nmolecules fluctuate cooperatively to facilitate electron transfer. We derive a\ngeneral formula of the reaction rate that depends on the overpotential, solvent\nproperties, the electronic structure of the electron donor/acceptor, and the\nexcess chemical potential of ions in the transition state. For Faradaic\nreactions, the theory predicts curved Tafel plots with a\nconcentration-dependent reaction-limited current. For moderate overpotentials,\nour formula reduces to the Butler-Volmer equation and explains its relevance,\nnot only in the well-known limit of large electron-transfer (solvent\nreorganization) energy, but also in the opposite limit of large ion-transfer\nenergy. The rate formula is applied to Li-ion batteries, where reduction of the\nelectrode host material couples with ion insertion. In the case of lithium iron\nphosphate, the theory accurately predicts the concentration dependence of the\nexchange current measured by {\\it in operando} X-Ray microscopy without any\nadjustable parameters.

This paper demonstrates thermal\nconductivity tensor measurements for transversely anisotropic materials, by\nextending beam-offset frequency-domain thermoreflectance (BO-FDTR) methods\nwhich had previously been limited to transversely isotropic materials.\nExtensive sensitivity analysis is used to determine an appropriate range of\nheating frequencies and beam offsets to extract various tensor elements. The\nnew technique is demonstrated on a model transversely anisotropic material,\nx-cut quartz (<110> {\\alpha}-SiO2), by combining beam offset measurements from\ndifferent sample orientations to reconstruct the full in-plane thermal\nconductivity tensor. The technique is also validated by measurements on two\ntransversely isotropic materials, sapphire and highly oriented pyrolytic\ngraphite (HOPG). The anisotropic measurements demonstrated very good\nself-consistency in correctly identifying isotropic directions when present,\nwith residual anisotropy errors below 4% for sapphire and 2% for HOPG and\nquartz. Finally, a computational case study (simulated experiment) shows how\nthe arbitrary in-plane thermal conductivity tensor of a fictitious material\nwith high in-plane anisotropy can in principle be obtained from only a single\nsample orientation, rather than multiple orientations like the experiments on\nx-cut quartz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 17:39:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

In the high-gain case PDC leads\nto generation of bright states having up to hundreds mW mean power. With such\nstates almost any nonlinear optical interaction or light-matter interaction\nbecomes more efficient. Even being macroscopically bright, the produced states\nmaintain nonclassical properties as, for example, the fluctuations of electric\nfield quadratures are squeezed below the shot-noise level. The high-gain PDC\ncould be used not only in the same applications as SPDC, it also can provide\nnew ones. Apart from that the high-gain PDC has many remarkable spectral and\nstatistical properties, which are in the focus of this work. The description\nstarts from the PDC generation in normal and anomalous group velocity\ndispersion ranges. The spectrum and mode content of high-gain PDC is considered\nas well as their change with the parametric gain are demonstrated. Then, there\nare the interference effects emerging from the PDC correlations presented,\nnamely the macroscopic analogue of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. In\naddition, it is shown how spatial and temporal walk-off matching could be used\nfor the generation of giant narrowband twin beams. Finally, the statistical\nproperties of high-gain PDC are reviewed as well as their use for multiphoton\neffects is demonstrated. Photon-number fluctuations of PDC are studied via\nnormalized correlation functions and probability distributions. These\nfluctuations enhance the generation efficiency for multiphoton effects by\norders of magnitude and lead to tremendously fluctuating light described by\nheavy-tailed photon-number probability distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 19:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

Effective testing allows infected individuals to be quarantined, thus\nreducing the spread of COVID-19, saving countless lives, and helping to restart\nthe economy safely and securely. Developing a good testing strategy can be\ngreatly aided by contact tracing that provides health care providers\ninformation about the whereabouts of infected patients in order to determine\nwhom to test. Countries that have been more successful in corralling the virus\ntypically use a ``test, treat, trace, test'' strategy that begins with testing\nindividuals with symptoms, traces contacts of positively tested individuals via\na combinations of patient memory, apps, WiFi, GPS, etc., followed by testing\ntheir contacts, and repeating this procedure. The problem is that such\nstrategies are myopic and do not efficiently use the testing resources. This is\nespecially the case with COVID-19, where symptoms may show up several days\nafter the infection (or not at all, there is evidence to suggest that many\nCOVID-19 carriers are asymptotic, but may spread the virus). Such greedy\nstrategies, miss out population areas where the virus may be dormant and flare\nup in the future.\n  In this paper, we show that the testing problem can be cast as a sequential\nlearning-based resource allocation problem with constraints, where the input to\nthe problem is provided by a time-varying social contact graph obtained through\nvarious contact tracing tools. We then develop efficient learning strategies\nthat minimize the number of infected individuals. These strategies are based on\npolicy iteration and look-ahead rules. We investigate fundamental performance\nbounds, and ensure that our solution is robust to errors in the input graph as\nwell as in the tests themselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 22:13:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

We focus on how nanothermodynamics impacts the\nstatistical mechanics of specific models. One example is an ideal gas of\nindistinguishable atoms in a large volume that subdivides into an ensemble of\nsmall regions of variable volume, with separate regions containing atoms that\nare distinguishable from those in other regions. Combining such subdivided\nregions yields the correct entropy of mixing, avoiding Gibbs paradox without\nresorting to macroscopic quantum symmetry for semi-classical particles.

Another result is to show similarity in the equilibrium\nproperties of a two-state model in the nanocanonical ensemble and a three-state\nmodel in the canonical ensemble.

The key idea is to support simple expression\nof the different assumptions underlying different semantics, and orthogonally\ninterpret aggregation operations using their simple usual meaning. We present a\nformal definition of the semantics, prove important properties of the\nsemantics, and compare with prior semantics. In particular, we present an\nefficient inference over aggregation that gives precise answers to all examples\nwe have studied from the literature.

The proposed method, called\nBounded Fuzzy Possibilistic Method (BFPM) addresses different issues that\nprevious clustering or classification methods have not sufficiently considered\nin their membership assignments. In fuzzy methods, the object's memberships\nshould sum to 1. Hence, any data object may obtain full membership in at most\none cluster or class. Possibilistic methods relax this condition, but the\nmethod can be satisfied with the results even if just an arbitrary object\nobtains the membership from just one cluster, which prevents the objects'\nmovement analysis. Whereas, BFPM differs from previous fuzzy and possibilistic\napproaches by removing these restrictions. Furthermore, BFPM provides the\nflexible search space for objects' movement analysis. Data objects are also\nconsidered as fundamental keys in learning methods, and knowing the exact type\nof objects results in providing a suitable environment for learning algorithms.\nThe Thesis introduces a new type of object, called critical, as well as\ncategorizing data objects into two different categories: structural-based and\nbehavioural-based. Critical objects are considered as causes of\nmiss-classification and miss-assignment in learning procedures. The Thesis also\nproposes new methodologies to study the behaviour of critical objects with the\naim of evaluating objects' movements (mutation) from one cluster or class to\nanother.

Firstly,\nwe optimize the sample generation process by assigning soft tags to the outlier\nsamples to generate semi-positive samples with continuous tag value between $0$\nand $1$, which not only produces more valid samples, but also strengthens the\nrobustness of the model. Secondly, a novel Center-$IoU$ loss is applied as a\nnew regression loss for bounding box regression, which not only retains the\ngood characteristics of IoU loss, but also solves some defects of it.

Given an error parameter $\\epsilon>0$,\nsuch algorithmic schemes attain a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation in only\n$t(\\epsilon)\\cdot poly(n)$ time, where $t(\\cdot)$ is some function that depends\nonly on $\\epsilon$. Technically speaking, our approach relies on presenting\ntailor-made reductions to a newly-introduced multi-dimensional extension of the\nSanta Claus problem [Bansal-Sviridenko, STOC'06]. Even though the\nsingle-dimensional problem is already known to be APX-Hard, we prove that an\nEPTAS can be designed under certain structural assumptions, which hold for our\napplications.\n  To demonstrate the versatility of our framework, we obtain an EPTAS for the\nadaptive ProbeMax problem as well as for its non-adaptive counterpart; in both\ncases, state-of-the-art approximability results have been inefficient\npolynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS) [Chen et al., NIPS'16; Fu et al.,\nICALP'18]. Turning our attention to selection-stopping settings, we further\nderive an EPTAS for the Free-Order Prophets problem [Agrawal et al., EC'20] and\nfor its cost-driven generalization, Pandora's Box with Commitment [Fu et al.,\nICALP'18]. These results improve on known PTASes for their adaptive variants,\nand constitute the first non-trivial approximations in the non-adaptive\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2020 12:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

The rising part of the light curve was monitored only in the\nR_PTF filter band, and maximum in this band was reached ~30 rest-frame days\nafter the estimated explosion time. The light curve and spectra of PTF11rka are\nconsistent with the core-collapse explosion of a ~10 Msun carbon-oxygen core\nevolved from a progenitor of main-sequence mass 25--40 Msun, that liberated a\nkinetic energy (KE) ~ 4 x 10^{51} erg, expelled ~8 Msun of ejecta (Mej), and\nsynthesised ~0.5 Msun of 56Nichel.

The first reason is that JRC allows individual radar and\ncommunication systems to share spectrum bands and thus improves the spectrum\nutilization. The second reason is that JRC enables a single hardware platform,\ne.g., an autonomous vehicle or a UAV, to simultaneously perform the\ncommunication function and the radar function. As a result, JRC is able to\nimprove the efficiency of resources, i.e., spectrum and energy, reduce the\nsystem size, and minimize the system cost. However, there are several\nchallenges to be solved for the JRC design. In particular, sharing the spectrum\nimposes the interference caused by the systems, and sharing the hardware\nplatform and energy resource complicates the design of the JRC transmitter and\ncompromises the performance of each function.

The task is to model students' mastery level of\nknowledge concepts based on their responses to the questions in the past, as\nwell as predict the probabilities that they correctly answer subsequent\nquestions in the future. KT tasks were historically solved using statistical\nmodeling methods such as Bayesian inference and factor analysis, but recent\nadvances in deep learning have led to the successive proposals that leverage\ndeep neural networks, including long short-term memory networks,\nmemory-augmented networks and self-attention networks. While those deep models\ndemonstrate superior performance over the traditional approaches, they all\nneglect the explicit modeling of the learning curve theory, which generally\nsays that more practice on the same knowledge concept enhances one's mastery\nlevel of the concept.

Basic\nassumptions of MIMIC are clearly violated in case of a variable being both an\nindicator and a cause, i.e. in the presence of reverse causality. Furthermore,\nthe model is then unidentified. To resolve the situation, which can arise\nfrequently, and as MIMIC estimation lacks closed form solutions for parameters\nwe utilize a version of Bollen's (1996) 2SLS estimator for structural equation\nmodels combined with J\\\"oreskog (1970)'s method of the analysis of covariance\nstructures to derive a new, 2SLS estimator for MIMIC models. Our 2SLS empirical\nestimation is based on static MIMIC specification but we point also to\ndynamic/error-correction MIMIC specification and 2SLS solution for it. We\nderive basic asymptotic theory for static 2SLS-MIMIC, present a simulation\nstudy and apply findings to an interesting empirical case of estimating\nprecarious status of older workers (using dataset of Survey of Health, Ageing\nand Retirement in Europe) which solves an important issue of the definition of\nprecarious work as a multidimensional concept, not modelled adequately so far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2020 14:09:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-06"}

This failure to provide an input for subjectivity\naccounts for a central challenge: the inability to address the question of \"Who\nverifies the verifier?\". Instead, these protocols outsource their legitimacy to\nmechanisms beyond their internal structure, relying on traditional centralized\ninstitutions such as national ID issuers and KYC providers to verify the claims\nthey hold. This reliance has been employed to safeguard applications from a\nvulnerability previously thought to be impossible to address in distributed\nsystems: the Sybil attack problem, which describes the abuse of an online\nsystem by creating many illegitimate virtual personas. Inspired by the progress\nin cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, there has recently been a surge\nin networked protocols that make use of subjective inputs such as voting,\nvouching, and interpreting, to arrive at a decentralized and sybil-resistant\nconsensus for identity.

Sharing the common ground with electromagnetics, the\nrealization of acoustic bianisotropy enables the exotic manipulation of\nacoustic waves in cooperation with a properly designed inverse bulk modulus and\nmass density. While the control of entire constitutive parameters substantiates\nintriguing theoretical and practical applications, a Willis metamaterial that\nenables independently and precisely designed polarizabilities has yet to be\ndeveloped to overcome the present restrictions of the maximum Willis bound and\nthe nonreciprocity inherent to the passivity of metamaterials. Here, by\nextending the recently developed concept of virtualized metamaterials, we\npropose acoustic Willis metamaterials that break the passivity and reciprocity\nlimit while also achieving decoupled control of all constitutive parameters\nwith designed frequency responses. By instituting basis convolution kernels\nbased on parity symmetry for each polarization response, we experimentally\ndemonstrate bianisotropy beyond the limit of passive media. Furthermore, based\non the notion of inverse design of the frequency dispersion by means of digital\nconvolution, purely nonreciprocal media and media with a broadband,\nflat-response Willis coupling are also demonstrated. Our approach offers all\npossible independently programmable extreme constitutive parameters and\nfrequency dispersion tunability accessible within the causality condition and\nprovides a flexible platform for realizing the full capabilities of acoustic\nmetamaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2020 02:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}
