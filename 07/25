The main objective of this task is to recommend a list of\nrelevant articles that the reader should refer to in order to understand the\ncontext and gain background information of the query article. Our first\napproach focuses on building an effective search query by combining weighted\nkeywords extracted from the query document and uses BM25 for retrieval. The\nsecond approach leverages the capability of SBERT (Nils Reimers et al.) to\nlearn contextual representations of the query in order to perform semantic\nsearch over the corpus. We empirically show that employing a language model\nbenefits our approach in understanding the context as well as the background of\nthe query article. The proposed approaches are evaluated on the TREC 2018\nWashington Post dataset and our best model outperforms the TREC median as well\nas the highest scoring model of 2018 in terms of the nDCG@5 metric. We further\npropose a diversity measure to evaluate the effectiveness of the various\napproaches in retrieving a diverse set of documents. This would potentially\nmotivate researchers to work on introducing diversity in their recommended\nlist. We have open sourced our implementation on Github and plan to submit our\nruns for the background linking task in TREC 2020.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 16:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-27"}

In order to generate the wave functions of\nthe isotope chains of interest, needed for calculating transfer intensities,\nprevious systematic studies with IBM and IBM-CM are taken without changing the\nparameters. Results for two-neutron transfer intensities are presented for Zr,\nHg and Pt isotopic chains using IBM-CM and, moreover, the same is done for Zr,\nPt and Sm isotopic chains using IBM with just a single configuration, i.e.,\nwithout using configuration mixing. In the case of Zr, the two-neutron transfer\nintensities between the ground states provide a clear observable indicating\nthat normal and intruder configurations coexist in the low-lying spectrum and\nthat they cross at A=98->100, and this could allow to disentangle whether or\nnot shape coexistence is inducing a given QPT.

To remain sound, languages insert run-time\nchecks at the boundaries between typed and untyped code. Unfortunately,\nperformance studies have shown that the overhead of these checks can be\ndisastrously high, calling into question the viability of sound gradual typing.\nIn this paper, we show that by building on existing work on soft contract\nverification, we can reduce or eliminate this overhead.\n  Our key insight is that while untyped code cannot be trusted by a gradual\ntype system, there is no need to consider only the worst case when optimizing a\ngradually-typed program. Instead, we statically analyze the untyped portions of\na gradually-typed program to prove that almost all of the dynamic checks\nimplied by gradual type boundaries cannot fail, and can be eliminated at\ncompile time. Our analysis is modular, and can be applied to any portion of a\nprogram.\n  We evaluate this approach on a dozen existing gradually-typed programs\npreviously shown to have prohibitive performance overhead---with a median\noverhead of $3.5\\times$ and up to $73.6\\times$ in the worst case---and\neliminate all overhead in most cases, suffering only $1.6\\times$ overhead in\nthe worst case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 16:30:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 19:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

They appear in the Hamiltonian analysis of the theory, and\nin the Lagrangian path integral when constructing the gravity partition\nfunction from topological BF theory. We develop here a systematic analysis of\nthe corner symplectic structure encoding the symmetry algebra of gravity, and\nperform a thorough analysis of the simplicity constraints. Starting from a\nprecursor phase space with Poincar\\'e and Heisenberg symmetry, we obtain the\ncorner phase space of BF theory by imposing kinematical constraints. This\namounts to fixing the Heisenberg frame with a choice of position and spin\noperators. The simplicity constraints then further reduce the Poincar\\'e\nsymmetry of the BF phase space to a Lorentz subalgebra. This picture provides a\nparticle-like description of (quantum) geometry: The internal normal plays the\nrole of the four-momentum, the Barbero-Immirzi parameter that of the mass, the\nflux that of a relativistic position, and the frame that of a spin harmonic\noscillator. Moreover, we show that the corner area element corresponds to the\nPoincar\\'e spin Casimir. We achieve this central result by properly splitting,\nin the continuum, the corner simplicity constraints into first and second class\nparts. We construct the complete set of Dirac observables, which includes the\ngenerators of the local $\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{C})$ subalgebra of Poincar\\'e,\nand the components of the tangential corner metric satisfying an\n$\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ algebra.

The proofs of both results contain\nalgorithms that can then be used to decide the tiling of a region with pegs in\n$O(n)$ time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 17:06:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 13:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

In recent years, this motivated the development of\noptimal classification tree algorithms that globally optimise the decision tree\nin contrast to heuristic methods that perform a sequence of locally optimal\ndecisions.

The success of our approach is attributed to a series of specialised\ntechniques that exploit properties unique to classification trees.

The scaling on efficiency is an\nexponential function of the number of photons. Schemes taking full advantage of\nquantum superpositions also depend sensitively on the coherence of the photons,\ni.e. their indistinguishability. It is therefore crucial to maintain the\ncoherence over long strings of photons.

Shortly after the Sun's protoplanetary\ndisk (PPD) cleared, the newly intense sunlight sparked a sublimative period in\nArrokoth's early history that lasted for ~10-100 Myr. Although this sublimation\nwas too weak to significantly alter Arrokoth's spin state, it could drive mass\ntransport around the surface significant enough to erase topographic features\non length scales of ~10-100 m. This includes craters up to ~50-500 m in\ndiameter, which suggests that the majority of Arrokoth's craters may not be\nprimordial (dating from the merger of Arrokoth's lobes), but rather could date\nfrom after the end of this sublimative period. Thereafter, Arrokoth entered a\nQuiescent Period (which lasts to the present day), in which volatile production\nrates are at least 13 orders of magnitude less than the ~10^24 molecules/s\ndetection limit of the New Horizons spacecraft (Lisse et al. 2020). This is\ninsufficient to drive either mass transport or sublimative torques. These\nresults suggest that the observed surface of Arrokoth is not primordial, but\nrather dates from the Quiescent Period. By contrast, the inability of\nsublimative torques to meaningfully alter Arrokoth's rotation state suggests\nthat its shape is indeed primordial, and its observed rotation is\nrepresentative of its spin state after formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 17:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

We propose a local mechanism to\nenrich protostellar disks with $^{26}$Al through irradiation of the\nprotostellar disk surface by cosmic rays accelerated in the protostellar\naccretion shock. We calculate the $^{26}$Al enrichment, [$^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al],\nat the surface of the protostellar disk in the inner AU throughout the\nevolution of low-mass stars, from M-dwarfs to proto-Suns. Assuming constant\nmass accretion rates, $\\dot{m}$, we find that irradiation by MeV cosmic rays\ncan provide significant enrichment on the disk surface if the cosmic rays are\nnot completely coupled to the gas in the accretion flow. Importantly, we find\nthat low accretion rates, $\\dot{m} < 10^{-7}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, are able\nto produce canonical amounts of $^{26}$Al, $[^{26}{\\rm Al}/^{27}{\\rm Al}]\n\\approx 5\\times10^{-5}$.

On the flip side, we measure\nthe Morse phase differences which suggest a complex and atypical lens system,\nwith at least five images including a magnified image at a local maximum of the\nFermat potential. The low prior probability for multiple lensed images and the\namount of fine tuning required in the lens model reduce the credibility of the\nlensing hypothesis. The long time delays between lensed images point toward a\ngalaxy cluster lens with an internal velocity dispersion $\\sigma \\sim 650\\,{\\rm\nkm/s}$, and the observed strain amplitudes imply a likely range $0.4 < z\n\\lesssim 0.7$ for the source redshift. We provide an error ellipse of $\\sim\n16\\,{\\rm deg}^2$ for the sky location of the source together with additional\nspecific constraints on the lens-host system, and encourage follow-up efforts\nto confirm or rule out any viable lens. If this is indeed a lensed event,\nsuccessfully pinpointing the system would offer a unique opportunity to\nidentify the host galaxy of a BBH merger, and even localize the source within\nit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 18:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

In the past, stars with these properties have\nbeen impossible to find due to extreme reddening and extinction along the line\nof sight to the inner bulge.

We like to call it the 'stock prediction problem,' viewing the\nsequence as the price history of a stock that goes up or down one unit at each\ntime step. In this problem, an investor has access to the predictions of two or\nmore 'experts,' and strives to minimize her final-time regret with respect to\nthe best-performing expert. Probability plays no role; rather, the market is\nassumed to be adversarial. We consider the case when there are two\nhistory-dependent experts, whose predictions are determined by the d most\nrecent stock moves. Focusing on an appropriate continuum limit and using\nmethods from optimal control, graph theory, and partial differential equations,\nwe discuss strategies for the investor and the adversarial market, and we\ndetermine associated upper and lower bounds for the investor's final-time\nregret. When d is less than 4 our upper and lower bounds coalesce, so the\nproposed strategies are asymptotically optimal.

The vortices transport heat to the phase boundary thereby\ncontrolling its morphology, characterized by the number and size of the voids\nformed in the solid, and the overall melt rate, which increases when the lower\nboundary is governed by a no-slip rather than a stress-free velocity boundary\ncondition. Moreover, the number and size of voids formed are relatively\ninsensitive to the Stefan number, here inversely proportional to the latent\nheat of fusion. For small values of the Stefan number, the convection in the\nfluid reaches a slowly evolving geostrophic state wherein columnar vortices\ntransport nearly all the heat from the lower boundary to melt the solid at an\napproximately constant rate. In this quasi-steady state, we find that the\nNusselt number, characterizing the heat flux, co-varies with the interfacial\nroughness, for all the flow parameters and Stefan numbers considered here.

For\nthe gap edit distance problem, we give an $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{n}{k}+k^2)$-time\ngreedy algorithm that distinguishes between length-$n$ input strings with edit\ndistance at most $k$ and those with edit distance exceeding $(3k+5)k$. This is\nan improvement and a simplification upon the result of Goldenberg, Krauthgamer,\nand Saha [FOCS 2019], where the $k$ vs $\\Theta(k^2)$ gap edit distance problem\nis solved in $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{n}{k}+k^3)$ time. We further generalize our\nresult to solve the $k$ vs $k'$ gap edit distance problem in time\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{nk}{k'}+k^2+ \\frac{k^2}{k'}\\sqrt{nk})$, strictly improving\nupon the previously known bound $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{nk}{k'}+k^3)$. Finally, we\nshow that if the input strings do not have long highly periodic substrings,\nthen already the $k$ vs $(1+\\epsilon)k$ gap edit distance problem can be solved\nin sublinear time. Specifically, if the strings contain no substring of length\n$\\ell$ with period at most $2k$, then the running time we achieve is\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{n}{\\epsilon^2 k}+k^2\\ell)$.\n  We further give the first sublinear-time probabilistic embedding of edit\ndistance to Hamming distance. For any parameter $p$, our\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{n}{p})$-time procedure yields an embedding with distortion\n$O(kp)$, where $k$ is the edit distance of the original strings. Specifically,\nthe Hamming distance of the resultant strings is between $\\frac{k-p+1}{p+1}$\nand $O(k^2)$ with good probability. This generalizes the linear-time embedding\nof Chakraborty, Goldenberg, and Kouck\\'y [STOC 2016], where the resultant\nHamming distance is between $\\frac k2$ and $O(k^2)$.

After\nyielding, many soft materials recover their quiescent properties over time as\nthey age. There remains, however, a lack of understanding of the nature of this\nrecovery. Here, we elucidate the mechanisms by which fibrillar networks restore\ntheir ability to support stress after yielding. Crucially, we observe that the\naging response bifurcates around a critical stress $\\sigma_\\mathrm{c}$, which\nis equivalent to the material yield stress. After an initial yielding event,\nfibrillar networks subsequently yield faster and at lower magnitudes of stress.\nFor stresses $\\sigma<\\sigma_\\mathrm{c}$, the time to yielding increases with\nwaiting time $t_\\mathrm{w}$ and diverges once the network has restored\nsufficient entanglement density to support the stress. When $\\sigma >\n\\sigma_\\mathrm{c}$, the yield time instead plateaus at a finite value because\nthe developed network density is insufficient to support the applied stress. We\nquantitatively relate the yielding and aging behavior of the network to the\ncompetition between stress-induced disentanglement and dynamic fluctuations of\nthe fibrils rebuilding the network. The bifurcation in the material response\naround $\\sigma_c$ provides a new possibility to more rigorously localize the\nyield stress in disordered materials with time-dependent behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 20:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

Competition between species in a population is considered by ecological\nniche-based theories as a key factor leading to different severity of species\nextinctions. There are population dynamics models that describe a simple and\neasily understandable mechanism for resource competition. However, these models\ncan not efficiently characterize and quantify new emergent extinctions in a\nlarge population appearing due to environmental forcing. To address this issue\nwe develop a stochastic physics-inspired approach to analyze how environmental\nforcing influences the severity of species extinctions in such models. This\napproach is based on the large deviations theory of stochastic processes (the\nFreidlin-Wentzell theory). We show that there are three possible fundamentally\ndifferent scenarios of extinctions, which we call catastrophic extinctions,\nasymmetric ones, and extinctions with exponentially small probabilities. The\nrealization of those scenarios depends on environmental noise properties and\nthe boundaries of niches, which define the domain, where species survive.\nFurthermore, we describe a hysteresis effect in species extinction showing that\nfluctuations can lead to dramatic consequences even if an averaged resource\nsupply is sufficient to support population survival. Our stochastic\nphysics-inspired approach generalizes niche theory by accounting environmental\nforcing and will be useful to find, by available data, which environmental\nperturbations may induce extinctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 22:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

To evaluate our framework, we conduct a user study on a real-time\nhuman-robot cooking task. Experimental results show that the generated\nexplanations of our approach significantly improves the collaboration\nperformance and user perception of the robot.

We present a spatiotemporal bundle\nadjustment framework that jointly optimizes four coupled sub-problems:\nestimating camera intrinsics and extrinsics, triangulating static 3D points, as\nwell as sub-frame temporal alignment between cameras and computing 3D\ntrajectories of dynamic points. Key to our joint optimization is the careful\nintegration of physics-based motion priors within the reconstruction pipeline,\nvalidated on a large motion capture corpus of human subjects.

We then train four multitask network\narchitectures: DenseNet201, InceptionNetV2, Xception, and MobileNetV2 to\npredict fish and dolphin numbers using two function approximation methods:\nregression and classification.

Math., 1992).\n  Our main result is a Ramsey theorem for alternating bilinear maps. Given $s,\nt\\in \\mathbb{N}$, $s, t\\geq 2$, and an alternating bilinear map $f:V\\times V\\to\nU$ with $\\dim(V)=s\\cdot t^4$, we show that there exists either a dimension-$s$\nsubspace $W\\leq V$ such that $\\dim(f(W, W))=0$, or a dimension-$t$ subspace\n$W\\leq V$ such that $\\dim(f(W, W))=\\binom{t}{2}$. This result has natural\ngroup-theoretic (for finite $p$-groups) and geometric (for Grassmannians)\nimplications, and leads to new Ramsey-type questions for varieties of groups\nand Grassmannians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 01:10:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2021 10:36:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 12:50:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

Despite this,\nthey achieve good prediction error on unseen data: interpolating the training\nset does not lead to a large generalization error. Further, overparametrization\nappears to be beneficial in that it simplifies the optimization landscape. Here\nwe study these phenomena in the context of two-layers neural networks in the\nneural tangent (NT) regime. We consider a simple data model, with isotropic\ncovariates vectors in $d$ dimensions, and $N$ hidden neurons. We assume that\nboth the sample size $n$ and the dimension $d$ are large, and they are\npolynomially related.

It remains challenging to effectively\nexploit complementary information across multiple views since the original data\noften contain noise and are highly redundant. Moreover, most existing\nmulti-view clustering methods only aim to explore the consistency of all views\nwhile ignoring the local structure of each view. However, it is necessary to\ntake the local structure of each view into consideration, because different\nviews would present different geometric structures while admitting the same\ncluster structure.

A\ntheoretical framework attributing the origin and sustainment of these fields to\nthe so-called fluctuation dynamo was recently validated by experiments on laser\nfacilities in low-magnetic-Prandtl-number plasmas ($\\mathrm{Pm} < 1$). However,\nthe same framework proposes that the fluctuation dynamo should operate\ndifferently when $\\mathrm{Pm} \\gtrsim 1$, the regime relevant to many\nastrophysical environments such as the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters.\nThis paper reports a new experiment that creates a laboratory $\\mathrm{Pm}\n\\gtrsim 1$ plasma dynamo for the first time. We provide a time-resolved\ncharacterization of the plasma's evolution, measuring temperatures, densities,\nflow velocities and magnetic fields, which allows us to explore various stages\nof the fluctuation dynamo's operation. The magnetic energy in structures with\ncharacteristic scales close to the driving scale of the stochastic motions is\nfound to increase by almost three orders of magnitude from its initial value\nand saturate dynamically. It is shown that the growth of these fields occurs\nexponentially at a rate that is much greater than the turnover rate of the\ndriving-scale stochastic motions. Our results point to the possibility that\nplasma turbulence produced by strong shear can generate fields more efficiently\nat the driving scale than anticipated by idealized MHD simulations of the\nnonhelical fluctuation dynamo; this finding could help explain the large-scale\nfields inferred from observations of astrophysical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 02:50:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

This paper provides different conclusions: 1) The popular convergence theory\nis wrong; 2) The locally maximal Q can affect the convergent speed, but cannot\nblock the global convergence; 3) Like marriage competition, unfair competition\nbetween two components may vastly decrease the globally convergent speed; 4)\nLocal convergence exists because the sample is too small, and unfair\ncompetition exists; 5) An improved EM algorithm, called the Channel Matching\n(CM) EM algorithm, can accelerate the global convergence.

We further\ngeneralize the proposed model by replacing the Gaussian observation layer with\nthe negative binomial distribution to model multivariate count time series.\nGenerated from the proposed GGP is an infinite dimensional directed sparse\nrandom graph, which is constructed by taking the logical OR operation of\ncountably infinite binary adjacency matrices that share the same set of\ncountably infinite nodes. Each of these adjacency matrices is associated with a\nweight to indicate its activation strength, and places a finite number of edges\nbetween a finite subset of nodes belonging to the same node community. We use\nthe generated random graph, whose number of nonzero-degree nodes is finite, to\ndefine both the sparsity pattern and dimension of the latent state transition\nmatrix of a (generalized) linear dynamical system. The activation strength of\neach node community relative to the overall activation strength is used to\nextract a multivariate sub-sequence, revealing the data pattern captured by the\ncorresponding community. On both synthetic and real-world time series, the\nproposed nonparametric Bayesian dynamic models, which are initialized at\nrandom, consistently exhibit good predictive performance in comparison to a\nvariety of baseline models, revealing interpretable latent state transition\npatterns and decomposing the time series into distinctly behaved sub-sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 04:16:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

The discrete nature of the\nlatent representations thus allows us to estimate for any input the conditional\nprobability distribution of the outputs very effectively.

Temporal\ncues are fine-grained; 2. Temporal modeling needs reasoning. To tackle both\nproblems at once, we exploit approximated bilinear modules (ABMs) for temporal\nmodeling. There are two main points making the modules effective: two-layer\nMLPs can be seen as a constraint approximation of bilinear operations, thus can\nbe used to construct deep ABMs in existing CNNs while reusing pretrained\nparameters; frame features can be divided into static and dynamic parts because\nof visual repetition in adjacent frames, which enables temporal modeling to be\nmore efficient. Multiple ABM variants and implementations are investigated,\nfrom high performance to high efficiency. Specifically, we show how two-layer\nsubnets in CNNs can be converted to temporal bilinear modules by adding an\nauxiliary-branch.

The\nchemo-kinematic analysis reveals the presence of the bar; of an inner thin\ndisk; of a thick disk, and of a broad metallicity population, with a large\nvelocity dispersion, indicative of a pressure supported component. We find and\ncharacterize chemically and kinematically a group of counter-rotating stars,\nwhich could be the result of a gas-rich merger event or just the result of\nclumpy star formation during the earliest phases of the early disk, which\nmigrated into the bulge.

Even stars with a\nhigh probability of belonging to the bar show the chemical bimodality in the\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] diagram.

Analysis of high spatial resolution X-ray maps of young SNRs has\nindicated that the particle acceleration process is accompanied by strong\nnon-adiabatic amplification of magnetic fields. If Fermi acceleration is the\nmechanism producing the energetic cosmic rays (CRs), the amplified magnetic\nfield must be turbulent and CR-driven instabilities are among the most probable\nmechanisms for converting the shock ram pressure into the magnetic turbulence.\nThe development and evolution of strong magnetic turbulence in the\ncollisionless plasmas forming SNR shells are complicated phenomena which\ninclude the amplification of magnetic modes, anisotropic mode transformations\nat shocks, as well as the nonlinear physics of turbulent cascades. Polarized\nX-ray synchrotron radiation from ultra-relativistic electrons accelerated in\nthe SNR shock is produced in a thin layer immediately behind the shock and is\nnot subject to the Faraday depolarization effect. These factors open\npossibilities to study some properties of magnetic turbulence and here we\npresent polarized X-ray synchrotron maps of SNR shells assuming different\nmodels of magnetic turbulence cascades. It is shown that different models of\nthe anisotropic turbulence can be distinguished by measuring the predominant\npolarization angle direction.

However, the poor ability of adapting to dynamic\nenvironments remains a major challenge for AI models. To better understand this\nissue, we study the problem of continual domain adaptation, where the model is\npresented with a labeled source domain and a sequence of unlabeled target\ndomains. There are two major obstacles in this problem: domain shifts and\ncatastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose Gradient Regularized\nContrastive Learning to solve the above obstacles. At the core of our method,\ngradient regularization plays two key roles: (1) enforces the gradient of\ncontrastive loss not to increase the supervised training loss on the source\ndomain, which maintains the discriminative power of learned features; (2)\nregularizes the gradient update on the new domain not to increase the\nclassification loss on the old target domains, which enables the model to adapt\nto an in-coming target domain while preserving the performance of previously\nobserved domains. Hence our method can jointly learn both semantically\ndiscriminative and domain-invariant features with labeled source domain and\nunlabeled target domains. The experiments on Digits, DomainNet and\nOffice-Caltech benchmarks demonstrate the strong performance of our approach\nwhen compared to the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 14:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

We\nutilize >800-nm thick tantala films deposited via ion-beam sputtering on\noxidized silicon wafers.

We provide theoretical results characterizing the asymptotic behavior\nof the posterior and the bagged posterior in the (misspecified) model selection\nsetting. We empirically assess the BayesBag approach on synthetic and\nreal-world data in (i) feature selection for linear regression and (ii)\nphylogenetic tree reconstruction. Our theory and experiments show that, when\nall models are misspecified, BayesBag (a) provides greater reproducibility and\n(b) places posterior mass on optimal models more reliably, compared to the\nusual Bayesian posterior; on the other hand, under correct specification,\nBayesBag is slightly more conservative than the usual posterior, in the sense\nthat BayesBag posterior probabilities tend to be slightly farther from the\nextremes of zero and one. Overall, our results demonstrate that BayesBag\nprovides an easy-to-use and widely applicable approach that improves upon\nBayesian model selection by making it more stable and reproducible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 19:23:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 19:02:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 19:39:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 17:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

The conventional opacity that\nhas been studied in the Discrete Event System (DES) literature usually assumes\npassive intruders, who only observe the behavior of the system. However, in\nmany cybersecurity concerns, such as web service, active intruders, who are\ncapable of influencing the system's behavior beyond passive observations, need\nto be considered and defended against. We are therefore motivated to extend the\nopacity notions to handle active intruders. For this, we model the system as a\nnon-deterministic finite-state transducer. It is assumed that the intruder has\na full knowledge of the system structure and is capable of interacting with the\nsystem by injecting different inputs and observing its responses. In this\nsetup, we first introduce reactive current-state opacity (RCSO) notion\ncharacterizing a property that the system does not leak its secret state\nregardless of how the intruder manipulates the system behavior. We furthermore\nextend this notion to language-based and initial-state reactive opacity\nnotions, and study the relationship among them. It turns out that all the\nproposed reactive opacity notions are equivalent to RCSO. We therefore focus on\nRCSO and study its verification problem. It is shown that the RCSO can be\nverified by constructing an observer automaton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 20:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

Local concentrations depend on transport phenomena\nincluding trapping effects, which are usually characterised by a\ntemperature-programmed desorption method often referred to as Thermal\nDesorption Analysis (TDA). When the hydrogen is released from the specimen\nduring the programmed heating, some desorption peaks are observed that are\ncommonly related to detrapping energies by means of an analytical procedure.\nThe limitations of this approach are revisited here and gaseous hydrogen\ncharging at high temperatures is simulated. This popular procedure enables\nattaining high concentrations due to the higher solubility of hydrogen at high\ntemperatures. However, the segregation behaviour of hydrogen into traps depends\non charging time and temperature. This process and the subsequent cooling alter\nhydrogen distribution are numerically modelled; it is found that TDA spectra\nare strongly affected by the charging temperature and the charging time, both\nfor weak and strong traps. However, the influence of ageing time at room\ntemperature after cooling and before desorption is only appreciable for weak\ntraps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 19:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}
