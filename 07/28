Our findings for this case show that, for specific values of\nthe Galileon coupling to the metric, the rate can be unsuppressed.

Probably the most significant of those is the crystallization\nof its core, a phase transition that occurs once the C/O interior has cooled\ndown below a critical temperature. This transition releases latent heat as well\nas gravitational energy due to the redistribution of the C and O ions during\nsolidification, thereby slowing down the evolution of the white dwarf. The\nunambiguous observational signature of core crystallization - a pile-up of\nobjects in the cooling sequence - was recently reported. However, existing\nevolution models struggle to quantitatively reproduce this signature, casting\ndoubt on their accuracy when used to measure the ages of stellar populations.\nThe timing and amount of the energy released during crystallization depend on\nthe exact form of the C/O phase diagram. Using the advanced Gibbs-Duhem\nintegration method and state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations of the solid\nand liquid phases, we have obtained a very accurate version of this phase\ndiagram, allowing a precise modeling of the phase transition. Despite this\nimprovement, the magnitude of the crystallization pile-up remains\nunderestimated by current evolution models.

However, in addition to the uncertain\nchannel state information (CSI) of the eavesdroppers due to their passive\nnature, the CSI of the legitimate users may also be imperfect at the base\nstation due to the limited feedback. Under both channel uncertainties, the\noptimal power allocation and transmission rate design for a secure NOMA scheme\nis currently not known due to the difficulty of handling the probabilistic\nconstraints. This paper fills this gap by proposing novel transformation of the\nprobabilistic constraints and variable decoupling so that the security\nguaranteed sum-rate maximization problem can be solved by alternatively\nexecuting branch-and-bound method and difference of convex programming. To\nscale the solution to a truly massive access scenario, a first-order algorithm\nwith very low complexity is further proposed. Simulation results show that the\nproposed first-order algorithm achieves identical performance to the\nconventional method but saves at least two orders of magnitude in computation\ntime.

In principle, the use of distributed\ntask allocation has reduced the computational time, allowing better response\nrates and higher data reliability. However, for these computational algorithms\nto run effectively in complex distributed systems, the algorithms ought to\ncompensate for communication asynchrony, and network node failures and delays\nknown as stragglers. These issues can change the effective connection topology\nof the network, which may vary through time, thus hindering the optimization\nprocess. In this paper, we propose a new distributed unconstrained optimization\nalgorithm for minimizing a strongly convex function which is adaptable to a\nparameter server network. In particular, the network worker nodes solve their\nlocal optimization problems, allowing the computation of their local coded\ngradients, and send them to different server nodes. Then each server node\naggregates its communicated local gradients, allowing convergence to the\ndesired optimizer. This algorithm is robust to network worker node failures or\ndisconnection, or delays known as stragglers. One way to overcome the straggler\nproblem is to allow coding over the network. We further extend this coding\nframework to enhance the convergence of the proposed algorithm under such\nvarying network topologies. Finally, we implement the proposed scheme in MATLAB\nand provide comparative results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 17:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

We perform unified\nsimulations of super-Earth formation and atmospheric evolution in evolving\ndisks that consider both photoevaporative winds and magnetically driven disk\nwinds. For the growth mode of planetary cores, we consider two cases in which\nplanetary embryos grow with and without pebble accretion. Our main findings are\nsummarized as follows. (i) The time span of atmospheric accretion is shortened\nby rapid disk dissipation due to photoevaporation, which prevents super-Earth\ncores from accreting massive atmospheres. (ii) Even if planetary cores grow\nrapidly by embryo accretion in the case without pebble accretion, the onset of\nrunaway gas accretion is delayed because the isolation mass for embryo\naccretion is small. Together with rapid disk clearing, the accretion of massive\natmospheres can be avoided. (iii) After rapid disk clearing, a number of\nhigh-eccentricity embryos can remain in outer orbits. Thereafter, such embryos\nmay collide with the super-Earths, leading to efficient impact erosion of\naccreted atmospheres.

This choice relaxes the dark matter (DM) search\nconstraints on the quintessential scalar singlet DM as well as presents new\nopportunities for its detection in the lab. The mixing produces an arbitrary\nmass difference between the two components of the extra doublet in a\ngauge-invariant way, without introducing any new scale of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking in the theory. It also provides a useful handle to distinguish between\nthe dark sector particles of different isospins, which is a challenging task\notherwise. As the dark leptons coannihilate non-trivially, the mixing\neffectively enhances the viable parameter space for the relic density\nconstraint. In low DM mass regime, our analysis shows that with a non-zero\nmixing, it is possible to relax the existing indirect search bounds on the\nupper limit of the DM-Standard Model coupling.

For this, we use persistent Betti\nnumbers to efficiently summarise the full topological structure of weak lensing\naperture mass maps. This method can be seen as an extension of the peak count\nstatistics, in which we additionally capture information about the environment\nsurrounding the maxima. We first demonstrate the performance in a mock analysis\nof the KiDS+VIKING-450 data: we extract the Betti functions from a suite of\n$w$CDM $N$-body simulations and use these to train a Gaussian process emulator\nthat provides rapid model predictions; we next run a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo\nanalysis on independent mock data to infer the cosmological parameters and\ntheir uncertainty.

Starting with deformations of the wave equation, we\ndiscuss models which have discretely self-similar threshold solutions. We study\nthreshold solutions in the past light cone of the blow-up point. In spherical\nsymmetry there is a sense in which a unique critical solution exists. Spherical\nnumerical evolutions are also presented for more general models, and exhibit\nsimilar behavior. Away from spherical symmetry threshold solutions attain more\nfreedom. Different topologies of blow-up are possible, and even locally the\ncritical solution needs reinterpretation as a parameterized family.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

Here we explore substructure\nformation in disks using analytical calculations and hydrodynamical simulations\nthat include a physically-motivated prescription for radiative effects\nassociated with the planet-induced density waves. For the first time, our\ntreatment accounts not only for cooling from the disk surface, but also for\nradiation transport along the disk midplane.

In this work, we\nrevisit this problem using non-spherical mass models, which have the advantage\nof being able to alleviate the degeneracy. Applying our mass models to the\ncurrently available kinematic data of the eight classical dSphs, we find that\nwithin finite uncertainties, most of these dSphs favor cusped central profiles\nrather than cored ones. In particular, Draco has a cusped dark matter halo with\nhigh probability even considering a prior bias. We also find the diversity of\nthe inner slopes in their dark matter halos.

We prove that\nwhen the microstructure is inertially oblate (i.e. pancake-like) this\nequilibrium is nonlinearly asymptotically stable.\n  Our proof employs a nonlinear energy method built from the natural energy\ndissipation structure of the problem. Numerous difficulties arise due to the\ndissipative-conservative structure of the problem. Indeed, the dissipation\nfails to be coercive over the energy, which itself is weakly coupled in the\nsense that, while it provides estimates for the fluid velocity and\nmicrostructure angular velocity, it only provides control of two of the six\ncomponents of the microinertia tensor. To overcome these problems, our method\nrelies on a delicate combination of two distinct tiers of energy-dissipation\nestimates, together with transport-like advection-rotation estimates for the\nmicroinertia. When combined with a quantitative rigidity result for the\nmicroinertia, these allow us to deduce the existence of global-in-time decaying\nsolutions near equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 18:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

The\nscaling relations point to critical exponents whose values differ from those of\na branching process, which has been the canonical model employed to understand\nbrain criticality. This suggested that a different model, with a different\nphase transition, might be required to explain the data. Here we show that this\nis not necessarily the case. By employing two different models belonging to the\nsame universality class as the branching process (mean-field directed\npercolation) and treating the simulation data exactly like experimental data,\nwe reproduce most of the experimental results. We find that subsampling the\nmodel and adjusting the time bin used to define avalanches (as done with\nexperimental data) are sufficient ingredients to change the apparent exponents\nof the critical point. Moreover, experimental data is only reproduced within a\nvery narrow range in parameter space around the phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 18:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-18"}

To avoid making false claims of detection, one must\naccount for this effect when assigning the statistical significance of an\nanomaly. This is typically accomplished by considering the trials factor, which\nis generally computed numerically via potentially expensive simulations. In\nthis paper we develop a continuous generalization of the Bonferroni and Sidak\ncorrections by applying the Laplace approximation to evaluate the Bayes factor,\nand in turn relating the trials factor to the prior-to-posterior volume ratio.\nWe use this to define a test statistic whose frequentist properties have a\nsimple interpretation in terms of the global $p$-value, or statistical\nsignificance.

The proposed model offers a high-security\nguarantee and high efficiency. The proposed digital system consists of four\ndifferent entities, user, data owner, cloud server, and key generation center\n(KGC).

Besides, the proposed model consisted of\nthe setup phase, key generation phase, encryption phase, validation phase,\naccess control phase, and data sharing phase. The setup phases are run by the\ndata owner, which takes input as a security parameter and generates the system\nmaster key and security parameter. Then, in the key generation phase, the\nprivate key is generated by KGC and is stored in the cloud server. After that,\nthe generated private key is encrypted. Then, the session key is generated by\nKGC and granted to the user and cloud server for storing, and then, the results\nare verified in the validation phase using validation messages.

The probability of $\\mathcal{T}_1$ has a continuous\nphase transition, increasing from 0 when the mean of the child distribution\nincreases above 1. On the other hand, the probability of $\\mathcal{T}_2$ has a\nfirst-order phase transition, jumping discontinuously to a nonzero value at\ncriticality. Given the recursive property satisfied by the event, we describe\nthe critical child distributions where a continuous phase transition takes\nplace. In many cases, we also characterize the event undergoing the phase\ntransition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 21:02:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 19:42:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 19:14:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 17:38:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

We further introduce\nexpressions for measuring the importance of feature value ranges for continuous\nfeatures. The expressions are formulated directly from the conjunctive clauses\nof the TM, making it possible to capture the role of features in real-time,\nalso during the learning process as the model evolves. Additionally, from the\nclosed-form expressions, we derive a novel data clustering algorithm for\nvisualizing high-dimensional data in three dimensions. Finally, we compare our\nproposed approach against SHAP and state-of-the-art interpretable machine\nlearning techniques. For both classification and regression, our evaluation\nshow correspondence with SHAP as well as competitive prediction accuracy in\ncomparison with XGBoost, Explainable Boosting Machines, and Neural Additive\nModels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 21:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

In essence it is a time-series modeling problem involving predicting\nhow a person will move in the future given how they moved in the past. Existing\nmethods, however, typically have a short time horizon, predicting a only few\nframes to a few seconds of human motion. Here we focus on long-term prediction;\nthat is, generating long sequences (potentially infinite) of human motion that\nis plausible. Furthermore, we do not rely on a long sequence of input motion\nfor conditioning, but rather, can predict how someone will move from as little\nas a single pose. Such a model has many uses in graphics (video games and crowd\nanimation) and vision (as a prior for human motion estimation or for dataset\ncreation). To address this problem, we propose a model to generate\nnon-deterministic, \\textit{ever-changing}, perpetual human motion, in which the\nglobal trajectory and the body pose are cross-conditioned. We introduce a novel\nKL-divergence term with an implicit, unknown, prior.

Given the shift in distributions that\ntypically occurs between video data captured from the source and target\ndomains, and absence of labeled data from the target domain, it is difficult to\nadapt a DL model for accurate recognition of target data. We argue that for\npair-wise matchers that rely on metric learning, e.g., Siamese networks for\nperson ReID, the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) objective should consist\nin aligning pair-wise dissimilarity between domains, rather than aligning\nfeature representations. Moreover, dissimilarity representations are more\nsuitable for designing open-set ReID systems, where identities differ in the\nsource and target domains. In this paper, we propose a novel\nDissimilarity-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (D-MMD) loss for aligning\npair-wise distances that can be optimized via gradient descent. From a person\nReID perspective, the evaluation of D-MMD loss is straightforward since the\ntracklet information allows to label a distance vector as being either\nwithin-class or between-class. This allows approximating the underlying\ndistribution of target pair-wise distances for D-MMD loss optimization, and\naccordingly align source and target distance distributions. Empirical results\nwith three challenging benchmark datasets show that the proposed D-MMD loss\ndecreases as source and domain distributions become more similar.

Extreme magnetic storms (minimum Dst $\\leq$ --250 nT) are\nextremely rare: only 7 events occurred during the era of spacecraft with\nhigh-level accelerometers such as CHAMP (CHAllenge Mini-satellite Payload) and\nGRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate experiment), and none with minimum Dst\n$\\leq$ --500 nT, here termed magnetic superstorms. Therefore, current knowledge\nof thermospheric mass density response to superstorms is very limited. Thus, in\norder to advance this knowledge, four known magnetic superstorms in history,\ni.e., events occurring before CHAMP's and GRACE's commission times, with\ncomplete datasets, are used to empirically estimate density enhancements and\nsubsequent orbital drag. The November 2003 magnetic storm (minimum Dst = --422\nnT), the most extreme event observed by both satellites, is used as the\nbenchmark event.

To extend DNN's superior inference\ncapabilities to energy constrained devices, architectures and circuits that\nminimize energy-per-MAC must be developed. In this respect, analog delay-based\nMAC is advantageous due to reasons both extrinsic and intrinsic to the MAC\nimplementation - (1) lower fixed-point precision requirement for a DNN's\nevaluation, (2) better dynamic range than charge-based accumulation, for\nsmaller technology nodes, and (3) simpler analog-digital interfacing.\nImplementing DNNs using delay-based MAC requires mixed-signal delay multipliers\nthat accept digitally stored weights and analog voltages as arguments. To this\nend, a novel, linearly tune-able delay-cell is proposed, wherein, the delay is\nrealized using an inverted MOS capacitor's (C*) steady discharge from a\nlinearly input-voltage dependent initial charge. The cell is analytically\nmodeled, constraints for its functional validity are determined, and\njitter-models are developed.

Research suggests that an immigrant's\ninitial arrival location plays a key role in shaping their economic success.\nYet immigrants currently lack access to personalized information that would\nhelp them identify optimal destinations. Instead, they often rely on\navailability heuristics, which can lead to the selection of sub-optimal landing\nlocations, lower earnings, elevated outmigration rates, and concentration in\nthe most well-known locations. To address this issue and counteract the effects\nof cognitive biases and limited information, we propose a data-driven decision\nhelper that draws on behavioral insights, administrative data, and machine\nlearning methods to inform immigrants' location decisions. The decision helper\nprovides personalized location recommendations that reflect immigrants'\npreferences as well as data-driven predictions of the locations where they\nmaximize their expected earnings given their profile. We illustrate the\npotential impact of our approach using backtests conducted with administrative\ndata that links landing data of recent economic immigrants from Canada's\nExpress Entry system with their earnings retrieved from tax records.\nSimulations across various scenarios suggest that providing location\nrecommendations to incoming economic immigrants can increase their initial\nearnings and lead to a mild shift away from the most populous landing\ndestinations.

In-home disposal, however, can negatively\nimpact the environment and public health. The drug take-back programs (drug\ntake-backs) sponsored by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and its\nstate and industry partners collect unused consumer medications and provide the\nbest alternative to in-home disposal of medicines. However, the drug take-backs\nare expensive to operate and not widely available. In this paper, we show that\nartificial intelligence (AI) can be applied to drug take-backs to render them\noperationally more efficient. Since identification of any waste is crucial to a\nproper disposal, we showed that it is possible to accurately identify loose\nconsumer medications solely based on the physical features and visual\nappearance. We have developed an automatic technique that uses deep neural\nnetworks and computer vision to identify and segregate solid medicines.

We also showed that hazardous pills could be distinguished from\nnon-hazardous pills within the dataset with an accuracy of 0.984.

We first\npropose novel closed-form expressions for the EC in a two-user NOMA network and\nshow that in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region, the 'strong' NOMA\nuser, referred to as U2, has a limited EC, assuming the same delay constraint\nas the 'weak' user, referred to as U1. We demonstrate that for the weak userU1,\nOMA and NOMA have comparable performance at low transmit SNRs, while NOMA\noutperforms OMA in terms of EC at high SNRs. On the other hand, for the strong\nuser U2, NOMA achieves higher EC than OMA at small SNRs, while OMA becomes more\nbeneficial at high SNRs. Furthermore, we show that at high transmit SNRs,\nirrespective of whether the application is delay tolerant, or not, the\nperformance gains of NOMA over OMA for U1, and OMA over NOMA for U2 remain\nunchanged. When the delay QoS of one user is fixed, the performance gap between\nNOMA and OMA in terms of total EC increases with decreasing statistical delay\nQoS constraints for the other user. Next, by introducing pairing, we show that\nNOMA with user-pairing outperforms OMA, in terms of total uplink EC. The best\npairing strategies are given in the cases of four and six users NOMA, raising\nonce again the importance of power allocation in the optimization of NOMA s\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 00:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

However, their\ndeployment is still relatively limited, and their broader adoption will depend\non their potential for cost reduction and performance improvement.\nUnderstanding this potential can inform critical climate change mitigation\nstrategies, including public policies and technology development efforts.\nHowever, many existing models of past cost decline, which often serve as\nstarting points for forecasting models, rely on limited data series and\nmeasures of technological progress. Here we systematically collect, harmonize,\nand combine various data series of price, market size, research and\ndevelopment, and performance of lithium-ion technologies. We then develop\nrepresentative series for these measures and employ performance curve models to\nestimate improvement rates. We also develop a method to incorporate additional\nperformance characteristics into these models, including energy density and\nspecific energy performance metrics. When energy density is incorporated into\nthe definition of service provided by a lithium-ion cell, estimated\ntechnological improvement rates increase considerably, suggesting that\npreviously reported improvement rates might underestimate the rate of\nlithium-ion technologies' change. Moreover, our estimates suggest the degree to\nwhich lithium-ion technologies' price decline might have been limited by\nperformance requirements other than cost per energy capacity. These rates also\nsuggest that battery technologies developed for stationary applications, where\nrestrictions on volume and mass are relaxed, might achieve faster cost\ndeclines, though engineering-based mechanistic cost modeling is required to\nfurther characterize this potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 00:15:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 21:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

Due to the lack of\nabundant ground-based measurement sites, it is difficult to estimate\nevapotranspiration (ET) covering most of the areas of Nepal from lower to\nhigher elevations. In this study, we proposed to use a remote sensing-based\nMETRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized\nCalibration) model for estimating ET in Nepal. Landsat 8 imagery, which\nprovides a fine spatial resolution (30 m), was used for the estimation. The\nresults obtained from the METRIC model were compared with ground-based\nmeasurements from an independent Eddy-Covariance (EC) station. Besides ET, the\nestimated surface temperatures (Ts) from the remote sensing model were also\ncompared with ground-based measurements for model validation. The results\nobtained from the remote sensing model were close to the ground-based\nmeasurements which establish the accuracy of the model. Root mean square error\n(RMSE) for hourly and daily ET was obtained as 0.06 mm/hr and 1.24 mm/day while\nmean bias error (MBE) for hourly and daily ET was observed as 0.03 mm/hr and\n0.29 mm/day, respectively. Further, we analyzed the variations of ET with\nelevation for six different months and found that ET was inversely related to\nelevation, in general, over the regions of Nepal. This was established as an\neffect of Ts and vegetation distribution over different elevations. To the best\nof our knowledge, our study is a first that has investigated ET estimation over\na topographically diverse region of Nepal with fine spatial resolution afforded\nby Landsat 8. Such large-scale ET estimation in Nepal has several applications.\nThis can be leveraged for agricultural planning and forecasting in a country\nwhere most of the population still relies on agriculture for their daily\nlivelihood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 00:32:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2020 04:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

Towards both spectrally-efficient and energy-efficient massive\nMIMO deployment, a number of hardware limited architectures have been proposed,\nincluding hybrid analog-digital structures, constant-envelope transmission, and\nuse of low-resolution DACs. In this paper, we overview the recent interest in\nimproving the error-rate performance of massive MIMO systems deployed with\n1-bit DACs through precoding at the symbol level. This line of research goes\nbeyond traditional interference suppression or cancellation techniques by\nmanaging interference on a symbol-by-symbol basis. This provides unique\nopportunities for interference-aware precoding tailored for practical massive\nMIMO systems. Firstly, we characterize constructive interference (CI) and\nelaborate on how CI can benefit the 1-bit signal design by exploiting the\ntraditionally undesired multi-user interference as well as the interference\nfrom imperfect hardware components. Subsequently, we overview several solutions\nfor 1-bit signal design to illustrate the gains achievable by exploiting CI.\nFinally, we identify some challenges and future research directions for 1-bit\nmassive MIMO systems that are yet to be explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 02:12:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 01:37:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2021 07:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

The Einstein-Maxwell\ndilaton-axion (EMDA) theory, which is central to this work is one such string\ninspired model arising in the low energy effective action of the heterotic\nstring theory with interesting implications in inflationary cosmology and in\nthe late time acceleration of the universe.

Due to the stealthy and persistent nature of the lateral movement,\ndefenders need to consider time and spatial locations holistically to discover\nlatent attack paths across a large time-scale and achieve long-term security\nfor the target assets. In this work, we propose a time-expanded random network\nto model the stochastic service links in the user-host enterprise network and\nthe adversarial lateral movement. We design cognitive honeypots at idle\nproduction nodes and disguise honey links as service links to detect and deter\nthe adversarial lateral movement. The location of the honeypot changes randomly\nat different times and increases the honeypots' stealthiness. Since the\ndefender does not know whether, when, and where the initial intrusion and the\nlateral movement occur, the honeypot policy aims to reduce the target assets'\nLong-Term Vulnerability (LTV) for proactive and persistent protection. We\nfurther characterize three tradeoffs, i.e., the probability of interference,\nthe stealthiness level, and the roaming cost. To counter the curse of multiple\nattack paths, we propose an iterative algorithm and approximate the LTV with\nthe union bound for computationally efficient deployment of cognitive\nhoneypots. The results of the vulnerability analysis illustrate the bounds,\ntrends, and a residue of LTV when the adversarial lateral movement has infinite\nduration. Besides honeypot policies, we obtain a critical threshold of\ncompromisability to guide the design and modification of the current system\nparameters for a higher level of long-term security.

Hence, SGD with large batch training has\nattracted more and more attention. However, existing empirical results show\nthat large batch training typically leads to a drop of generalization accuracy.\nAs a result, large batch training has also become a challenging topic. In this\npaper, we propose a novel method, called stochastic normalized gradient descent\nwith momentum (SNGM), for large batch training.

However, the ability in the fusion of HS and MS images remains to be\nimproved, particularly in large-scale scenes, due to the limited acquisition of\nHS images. Alternatively, we super-resolve MS images in the spectral domain by\nthe means of partially overlapped HS images, yielding a novel and promising\ntopic: spectral superresolution (SSR) of MS imagery. This is challenging and\nless investigated task due to its high ill-posedness in inverse imaging. To\nthis end, we develop a simple but effective method, called joint sparse and\nlow-rank learning (J-SLoL), to spectrally enhance MS images by jointly learning\nlow-rank HS-MS dictionary pairs from overlapped regions. J-SLoL infers and\nrecovers the unknown hyperspectral signals over a larger coverage by sparse\ncoding on the learned dictionary pair.

Hyperspectral super-resolution refers to fusing\nHSI and MSI to generate an image with both high spatial and high spectral\nresolutions. Recently, several new methods have been proposed to solve this\nfusion problem, and most of these methods assume that the prior information of\nthe Point Spread Function (PSF) and Spectral Response Function (SRF) are known.\nHowever, in practice, this information is often limited or unavailable. In this\nwork, an unsupervised deep learning-based fusion method - HyCoNet - that can\nsolve the problems in HSI-MSI fusion without the prior PSF and SRF information\nis proposed. HyCoNet consists of three coupled autoencoder nets in which the\nHSI and MSI are unmixed into endmembers and abundances based on the linear\nunmixing model. Two special convolutional layers are designed to act as a\nbridge that coordinates with the three autoencoder nets, and the PSF and SRF\nparameters are learned adaptively in the two convolution layers during the\ntraining process. Furthermore, driven by the joint loss function, the proposed\nmethod is straightforward and easily implemented in an end-to-end training\nmanner. The experiments performed in the study demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod performs well and produces robust results for different datasets and\narbitrary PSFs and SRFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 06:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

We develop a novel forensic technique for\ndistinguishing between attacker activity and benign activity in compromised\nenterprise accounts that yields few false positives and enables us to perform\nfine-grained analysis of attacker behavior. Applying our methods to a set of\n159 compromised enterprise accounts, we quantify the duration of time attackers\nare active in accounts and examine thematic patterns in how attackers access\nand leverage these hijacked accounts. We find that attackers frequently dwell\nin accounts for multiple days to weeks, suggesting that delayed (non-real-time)\ndetection can still provide significant value. Based on an analysis of the\nattackers' timing patterns, we observe two distinct modalities in how attackers\naccess compromised accounts, which could be explained by the existence of a\nspecialized market for hijacked enterprise accounts: where one class of\nattackers focuses on compromising and selling account access to another class\nof attackers who exploit the access such hijacked accounts provide. Ultimately,\nour analysis sheds light on the state of enterprise account hijacking and\nhighlights fruitful directions for a broader space of detection methods,\nranging from new features that home in on malicious account behavior to the\ndevelopment of non-real-time detection methods that leverage malicious activity\nafter an attack's initial point of compromise to more accurately identify\nattacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 07:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

By systematically analyzing the normal mode\ndecomposition and structure factor methods, we conclude that the vibrational\ndispersion can be calculated by applying effective wave vectors in the\nstructure factor method, while the vibrational relaxation time calculated by\nthe normal mode decomposition method is questionable since the group velocity\ncannot be defined on the Gamma point. We also show that the anharmonicity\ncaused by the system temperature has little effect on the relaxation times of\nthe propagating modes in amorphous materials, and therefore, the corresponding\nmodal and total thermal conductivity is temperature independent when all the\nvibrations are assumed to be excited. The non-propagating modes, i.e.,\ndiffusons, conduct heat via thermal coupling between different vibrational\nmodes, and can be calculated by harmonic lattice dynamics using Allen-Feldman\ntheory. As a result, the thermal conductivity contributed from diffusons is\nalso temperature independent when all the vibrational modes are activated which\nis the situation in molecular dynamics simulations. The total thermal\nconductivity concerning both propagons (50%) and diffusons (50%) agree quite\nwell with the results computed using Green-Kubo equilibrium molecular dynamics.\nBy correcting the excitation state of the vibrations in amorphous solids, the\nthermal conductivity calculated by the structure factor method and\nAllen-Feldman theory can fully capture the experimentally measured\ntemperature-dependent thermal conductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 07:22:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 02:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}

In\nthis paper, we describe a foray into the problem of unit test generation for\ndynamically typed languages. We introduce Pynguin, an automated unit test\ngeneration framework for Python. Using Pynguin, we aim to empirically shed\nlight on two central questions: (1) Do well-established search-based test\ngeneration methods, previously evaluated only on statically typed languages,\ngeneralise to dynamically typed languages? (2) What is the influence of\nincomplete type information and dynamic typing on the problem of automated test\ngeneration? Our experiments confirm that evolutionary algorithms can outperform\nrandom test generation also in the context of Python, and can even alleviate\nthe problem of absent type information to some degree.

Most previous\nworks in the artificial intelligence field focus on recognizing emotion rather\nthan mining the reason why emotions are not or wrongly recognized. Correlation\namong emotions contributes to the failure of emotion recognition. In this\npaper, we try to fill the gap between emotion recognition and emotion\ncorrelation mining through natural language text from web news. Correlation\namong emotions, expressed as the confusion and evolution of emotion, is\nprimarily caused by human emotion cognitive bias. To mine emotion correlation\nfrom emotion recognition through text, three kinds of features and two deep\nneural network models are presented. The emotion confusion law is extracted\nthrough orthogonal basis. The emotion evolution law is evaluated from three\nperspectives, one-step shift, limited-step shifts, and shortest path transfer.\nThe method is validated using three datasets-the titles, the bodies, and the\ncomments of news articles, covering both objective and subjective texts in\nvarying lengths (long and short). The experimental results show that, in\nsubjective comments, emotions are easily mistaken as anger. Comments tend to\narouse emotion circulations of love-anger and sadness-anger. In objective news,\nit is easy to recognize text emotion as love and cause fear-joy circulation.\nThat means, journalists may try to attract attention using fear and joy words\nbut arouse the emotion love instead; After news release, netizens generate\nemotional comments to express their intense emotions, i.e., anger, sadness, and\nlove. These findings could provide insights for applications regarding\naffective interaction such as network public sentiment, social media\ncommunication, and human-computer interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 08:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

We\napply these penalties to impose the smoothness of the estimated 2D-SDFs and the\nspatial dependence of the spatially-correlated subregions. The proposed\ntechnique provides a score matrix, that is comprised of the estimated\ncoefficients associated with the common set of basis functions representing the\n2D-SDFs. {Instead of clustering the estimated SDFs directly, we propose to\nemploy the score matrix for clustering purposes, taking advantage of its\nlow-dimensional property.} In a simulation study, we demonstrate that our\nproposed method outperforms other competing estimation procedures used for\nclustering. Finally, to validate the described clustering method, we apply the\nprocedure to soil moisture data from the Mississippi basin to produce\nhomogeneous spatial clusters. We produce animations to dynamically show the\nestimation procedure, including the estimated 2D-SDFs and the score matrix,\nwhich provide an intuitive illustration of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 09:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

Among these, vortical\nsingularities arise due to vortex stretching which can lead to unbounded growth\nof enstrophy. Viscosity and resistivity provide dissipative regularizations of\nthese singularities. In analogy with the dispersive KdV regularization of the\n1D inviscid Burgers' equation, we propose a local conservative regularization\nof ideal 3D compressible flows, MHD and 2-fluid plasmas (with potential\napplications to high vorticity flows with low dissipation). The regularization\ninvolves introducing a vortical `twirl' term lambda^2 w x curl w in the\nvelocity equation. The cut-off length lambda must be inversely proportional to\nsquare root of density to ensure the conservation of a `swirl' energy. The\nlatter includes positive kinetic, compressional, magnetic and vortical\ncontributions, thus leading to a priori bounds on enstrophy. The extension to\n2-fluid plasmas involves additionally magnetic `twirl' terms in the ion and\nelectron velocity equations and a solenoidal addition to the current in\nAmpere's law. A Hamiltonian-Poisson bracket formulation is developed using the\nswirl energy as Hamiltonian. We also establish a minimality property of the\ntwirl regularization. A swirl velocity field is shown to transport vortex and\nmagnetic flux tubes as well as w/rho and B/rho, thus generalizing the\nKelvin-Helmholtz and Alfven theorems. The steady regularized equations are used\nto model a rotating vortex, MHD pinch and vortex sheet. Our regularization\ncould facilitate numerical simulations and a statistical treatment of vortex\nand current filaments in 3D. Finally, we briefly describe a conservative\nregularization of shock-like singularities in compressible flow generalizing\nboth the KdV and nonlinear Schrodinger equations to the adiabatic dynamics of a\ngas in 3D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 09:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

Vertex model (VM)\nsimulations have provided crucial insights into the dynamics of such systems,\nbut their nonequilibrium nature makes it difficult for theoretical development.\nCellular Potts model (CPM) of confluent monolayer provides an alternative model\nfor such systems with a well-defined equilibrium limit. We combine numerical\nsimulations of CPM and an analytical study based on one of the most successful\ntheories of equilibrium glass, the random first order transition theory, and\ndevelop a comprehensive theoretical framework for a confluent glassy system. We\nfind that the glassy dynamics within CPM is qualitatively similar to that in\nVM. Our study elucidates the crucial role of geometric constraints in bringing\nabout two distinct regimes in the dynamics, as the target perimeter $P_0$ is\nvaried. The unusual sub-Arrhenius relaxation results from the distinctive\ninteraction potential arising from the perimeter constraint in such systems.\nFragility of the system decreases with increasing $P_0$ in the low-$P_0$\nregime, whereas the dynamics is independent of $P_0$ in the other regime. The\nrigidity transition, found in VM, is absent within CPM; this difference seems\nto come from the nonequilibrium nature of the former.

We answer these questions by computing reachable\nsets of neural networks, i.e. sets of outputs resulting from continuous sets of\ninputs. We provide two efficient approaches that lead to over- and\nunder-approximations of the reachable set. This principle is highly versatile,\nas we show. First, we use it to analyze and enhance the robustness properties\nof both classifiers and regression models. This is in contrast to existing\nworks, which are mainly focused on classification. Specifically, we verify\n(non-)robustness, propose a robust training procedure, and show that our\napproach outperforms adversarial attacks as well as state-of-the-art methods of\nverifying classifiers for non-norm bound perturbations. Second, we provide\ntechniques to distinguish between reliable and non-reliable predictions for\nunlabeled inputs, to quantify the influence of each feature on a prediction,\nand compute a feature ranking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 10:58:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 16:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}

Popular fire detection techniques such as satellite imaging and\nremote camera-based sensing suffer from late detection and low reliability\nwhile early wildfire detection is a key to prevent massive fires. In this\npaper, we propose a novel wildfire detection solution based on unmanned aerial\nvehicles assisted Internet of things (UAV-IoT) networks. The main objective is\nto (1) study the performance and reliability of the UAV-IoT networks for\nwildfire detection and (2) present a guideline to optimize the UAV-IoT network\nto improve fire detection probability under limited budgets. We focus on\noptimizing the IoT devices' density and number of UAVs covering the forest area\nsuch that a lower bound of the wildfires detection probability is maximized\nwithin a limited time and budget. At any time after the fire ignition, the IoT\ndevices within a limited distance from the fire can detect it. These IoT\ndevices can then report their measurements only when the UAV is nearby.\nDiscrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) analysis is utilized to compute the fire\ndetection probability at discrete time. Before declaring fire detection, a\nvalidation state is designed to account for IoT devices' practical limitations\nsuch as miss-detection and false alarm probabilities. Numerical results suggest\nthat given enough system budget, the UAV-IoT based fire detection can offer a\nfaster and more reliable wildfire detection solution than the state of the art\nsatellite imaging techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 12:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

The inevitable price to pay for such a general result is that\n$f$ is a tower of exponentials of height roughly $k$. In this paper, we show\nthat algorithms based on twin-width need not be impractical.

We vary\nfive parameters: flapping amplitude, frequency (or Reynolds number), horizontal\nand vertical spacings between plates, and oncoming fluid stream velocity.\nLattices that are closely spaced in the streamwise direction produce intense\nvortex dipoles between adjacent plates. The lattices transition sharply from\ndrag- to thrust-producing as these dipoles switch from upstream to downstream\norientations at critical flow speeds. Near these transitions the flows assume a\nvariety of periodic and nonperiodic states, with and without up-down symmetry,\nand multiple stable self-propelled speeds can occur. As the streamwise spacing\nincreases, the plates may shed typical vortex wakes that impinge on downstream\nneighbors. With small lateral spacing, rectangular lattices yield net drag,\nwhile rhombic lattices may generate net thrust, sometimes with high efficiency.\nAs lateral spacing increases, rectangular lattices begin to generate thrust,\neventually with slightly higher efficiencies than rhombic lattices, as the two\ntypes of lattice flows converge.

This scheme uses\nlabels of poly-logarithmic length $O(\\log n^3)$ allowing a constant decoding\ntime. Given the labels of two vertices $u$ and $v$, the decoding function\nreturnsa value between the exact distance $d_G(u,v)$ and its quadruple\n$4d_G(u,v)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 13:21:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 14:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

The Barzilai-Borwein (BB) gradient method is\nchosen in this paper over other Quasi-Newton methods such as the\nBroyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm because of its less\ncomputational complexities. In addition, the BB gradient method is suitable for\nlarge-scale optimization problems including the online optimization scenario\npresented in this paper. To corroborate the effectiveness of the\nBarzilai-Borwein (BB) gradient algorithm, a greedy online gradient algorithm is\nused in this study based on the two BB step sizes. Through a rigorous regret\nanalysis on the BB step sizes, it is established that the regret obtained from\nthe BB algorithm is sublinear in time.

Interestingly,\nhowever, the sketching and dynamic streaming complexity of approximating the\nshortest path metric of a graph is still far from well-understood. Besides a\ndirect $k$-pass implementation of classical spanner constructions (recently\nimproved to $\\lfloor\\frac k2\\rfloor+1$-passes by Fernandez, Woodruff and\nYasuda'20) the state of the art amounts to a $O(\\log k)$-pass algorithm of Ahn,\nGuha and McGregor'12, and a $2$-pass algorithm of Kapralov and Woodruff'14.

We aimed to derive a\ncomplete chemical pattern for this star, in order to compare it with those of\nchemically peculiar stars. Methods. We carried out a detailed abundance\ndetermination in the planet host star KELT-17 via spectral synthesis. Stellar\nparameters were estimated iteratively by fitting Balmer line profiles and\nimposing the Fe ionization balance, using the program SYNTHE together with\nplane-parallel ATLAS12 model atmospheres. Specific opacities for an arbitrary\ncomposition and microturbulence velocity vmicro were calculated through the\nOpacity Sampling (OS) method. The abundances were determined iteratively by\nfitting synthetic spectra to metallic lines of 16 different chemical species\nusing the program SYNTHE. The complete chemical pattern of KELT-17 was compared\nto the recently published average pattern of Am stars. We estimated the stellar\nradius by two methods: a) comparing the synthetic spectral energy distribution\nwith the available photometric data and the Gaia parallax, and b) using a\nBayesian estimation of stellar parameters using stellar isochrones.

The\ndimensional analysis of several important tensors and tensor operations is\nsummarized.

The approach was used in numerical implementations of the\nhigh-dimensional integration routine and in earlier work it was shown that the\ncomputations are more effective and thus more precise than those based on Rice\nexpansions.\n  The joint distribution of excursion times is related to the distribution of\nthe number of level crossings, a problem that can be attacked via the Rice\nseries expansion, based on the moments of the number of crossings. Another\npoint of attack is the \"Independent Interval Approximation\" intensively studied\nfor the persistence of physical systems. It treats the lengths of successive\ncrossing intervals as statistically independent. A renewal type argument leads\nto an expression that provides the approximate interval distribution via its\nLaplace transform.\n  However, independence is not valid in typical situations. Even if it leads to\nacceptable results for the persistency exponent, rigorous assessment of the\napproximation error is not available. Moreover, we show that the IIA approach\ncannot deliver properly defined probability distributions and thus the method\nis limited to persistence studies.\n  This paper presents an alternative approach that is both more general, more\naccurate, and relatively unknown. It is based on exact expressions for the\nprobability density for one and for two successive excursion lengths. The\nnumerical routine RIND computes the densities using recent advances in\nscientific computing and is easily accessible via a simple Matlab interface.\nThe result solves the problem of two-step excursion dependence for a general\nstationary differentiable Gaussian process.

Using the integrated\nemission from unresolved galaxies or gas clouds, line intensity mapping (LIM)\nprovides a new observational window to measure the larger properties of\nstructure. This very promising technique motivates the community to plan for\nLIM experiments.\n  We describe the development of a large field-of-view instrument, named\nCONCERTO, operating in the range 130-310 GHz from the APEX 12-meters telescope.\nCONCERTO is a low-resolution spectrometer based on the Lumped Element Kinetic\nInductance Detectors technology. Spectra are obtained using a fast Fourier\nTransform Spectrometer (FTS), coupled to a dilution cryostat with base\ntemperature of 0.1K. Two 2 kilo-pixels arrays of LEKID are mounted inside the\ncryostat that also contains the cold optics and the front-end electronics.\n  We present in detail the technological choices leading to the instrumental\nconcept, together with the design and fabrication of the instrument and\npreliminary laboratory tests on the detectors. We also give our best estimates\nof CONCERTO sensitivity and give predictions for two of the main scientific\ngoals of CONCERTO, i.e. a [CII]-intensity mapping survey and observations of\ngalaxy clusters.\n  We provide a detail description of the instrument design. Based on realistic\ncomparisons with existing instruments developed by our group (NIKA, NIKA2, and\nKISS), and on laboratory detectors characterisation, we provide an estimate of\nCONCERTO sensitivity on sky. Finally, we describe in detail two out of the main\nscience goals offered by CONCERTO at APEX.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 14:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

The recent introduction of NR-U as part of 5G introduces new\ncoexistence opportunities because it implements scalable numerology (flexible\nsubcarrier spacing and OFDM symbol lengths), and non-slot based scheduling\n(mini-slots), which considerably impact channel access. This paper analyzes the\nimpact of NR-U settings on its coexistence with Wi-Fi networks and compares it\nwith LAA operation using simulations and experiments. First, we propose a\ndownlink channel access simulation model, which addresses the problem of the\ndependency and non-uniformity of transmission attempts of different nodes, as a\nresult of the synchronization mechanism introduced by NR-U. Second, we validate\nthe accuracy of the proposed model using FPGA-based LAA, NR-U, and Wi-Fi\nprototypes with over-the-air transmissions. Additionally, we show that\nreplacing LAA with NR-U would not only allow to overcome the problem of\nbandwidth wastage caused by reservation signals but also, in some cases, to\npreserve fairness in channel access for both scheduled and random-access\nsystems. Finally, we conclude that fair coexistence of the aforementioned\nsystems in unlicensed bands is not guaranteed in general, and novel mechanisms\nare necessary for improving the sharing of resources between scheduled and\ncontention-based technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 14:10:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 17:41:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 10:25:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 12:44:06 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 07:56:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

Here we report the production of a 2D MoS2-based ink-type\nelectrocatalyst by a scalable top-down exfoliation technique followed by a\nsimple heat treatment. The catalyst shows a high current density of 1000 mA\ncm^-2 at an overpotential of 454 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)\nwithout the need of iR correction, as well as good stability over 24 hours.\nUsing the same method, we have, for the first time, produced a cheap MoS2\nmineral-based catalyst and found that it had an excellent performance for\nhigh-current-density HER. Noteworthy, production rate of this MoS2-based\ncatalyst is one to two orders of magnitude higher than those previously\nreported. In addition, the price of the MoS2 mineral is five orders of\nmagnitude lower than commercial Pt catalysts, making the MoS2 mineral-based\ncatalyst cheap, and the ink-type catalyst dispersions can be easily integrated\nwith other technologies for large-scale catalyst electrode preparation. These\nadvantages indicate the huge potentials of this method and mineral-based cheap\nand abundant natural resources as catalysts in the electrochemical\ntechnologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 14:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

This holds in particular for all\nrelevant subgroups of $Gal$, $cPoi$, and $cEucl$ (the groups of Galilean,\nPoincar\\'e and Euclidean transformations, respectively, where $c\\in Q$ is a\nmodel-specific parameter orresponding to the speed of light in the case of\nPoincar\\'e transformations).\n  In doing so, by an elementary geometrical proof, we demonstrate our main\ncontribution: spatial isotropy is enough to entail that the set $W$ of\nworldview transformations satisfies either $W\\subseteq Gal$, $W\\subseteq cPoi$,\nor $W\\subseteq cEucl$ for some $c>0$. So assuming spatial isotropy is enough to\nprove that there are only 3 possible cases: either the world is classical (the\nworldview transformations between inertial observers are Galilean\ntransformations); the world is relativistic (the worldview transformations are\nPoincar\\'e transformations); or the world is Euclidean (which gives a\nnonstandard kinematical interpretation to Euclidean geometry). This result\nconsiderably extends previous results in this field, which assume a priori the\n(strictly stronger) special principle of relativity, while also restricting the\nchoice of $Q$ to the field of reals.\n  As part of this work, we also prove the rather surprising result that, for\nany $G$ containing translations and rotations fixing the time-axis $t$, the\nrequirement that $G$ be a subgroup of one of the groups $Gal$, $cPoi$ or\n$cEucl$ is logically equivalent to the somewhat simpler requirement that, for\nall $g\\in G$: $g[t]$ is a line, and if $g[t]=t$ then $g$ is a trivial\ntransformation (i.e. $g$ is a linear transformation that preserves Euclidean\nlength and fixes the time-axis setwise).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 14:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

Compared with the\ntraditional \"segment-then-associate\" two-stage approach, a single-stage\nalgorithm not only simultaneously achieves consistent instance cell\nsegmentation and tracking but also gains superior performance when\ndistinguishing ambiguous pixels on boundaries and overlaps. However, the\ndeployment of an embedding based algorithm is restricted by slow inference\nspeed (e.g., around 1-2 mins per frame). In this study, we propose a novel\nFaster Mean-shift algorithm, which tackles the computational bottleneck of\nembedding based cell segmentation and tracking. Different from previous\nGPU-accelerated fast mean-shift algorithms, a new online seed optimization\npolicy (OSOP) is introduced to adaptively determine the minimal number of\nseeds, accelerate computation, and save GPU memory.

In this study, we determine the morphology and mass-loss rate of jets\nemanating from the companion in post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binary\nstars with a circumbinary disk. In doing so, we also determine the mass\naccretion rates on to the companion and investigate the source feeding the\ncircum-companion accretion disk. Methods. We perform a spatio-kinematic\nmodelling of the jet of two well-sampled post-AGB binaries, BD+46442 and\nIRAS19135+3937, by fitting the orbital phased time series of H-alpha spectra.\nOnce the jet geometry, velocity and scaled density structure are computed, we\ncarry out radiative transfer modelling of the jet for the first four Balmer\nlines to determine the jet densities, thus allowing us to compute the jet\nmass-loss rates and mass accretion rates. Results. The spatio-kinematic model\nof the jet reproduces the observed absorption feature in the H-alpha lines. In\nboth objects, the jets have an inner region with extremely low density. Using\nour radiative transfer model, we find the full three-dimensional density\nstructure of both jets. From these results, we can compute mass-loss rates of\nthe jets, which are of the order of 10^-7 - 10^-5 M_sol/yr. We estimate mass\naccretion rates onto the companion of 10^-6 - 10^-4 M_sol/yr. Conclusions.\nBased on the mass accretion rates found for these two objects, we conclude that\nthe circumbinary disk is most likely the source feeding the circum-companion\naccretion disk. This is in agreement with the observed depletion patterns in\npost-AGB binaries. The high accretion rates from the circumbinary disk imply\nthat the lifetime of the disk will be short.

Existing membership inference attacks\nexploit models' abnormal confidence when queried on their training data. These\nattacks do not apply if the adversary only gets access to models' predicted\nlabels, without a confidence measure. In this paper, we introduce label-only\nmembership inference attacks. Instead of relying on confidence scores, our\nattacks evaluate the robustness of a model's predicted labels under\nperturbations to obtain a fine-grained membership signal. These perturbations\ninclude common data augmentations or adversarial examples. We empirically show\nthat our label-only membership inference attacks perform on par with prior\nattacks that required access to model confidences. We further demonstrate that\nlabel-only attacks break multiple defenses against membership inference attacks\nthat (implicitly or explicitly) rely on a phenomenon we call confidence\nmasking. These defenses modify a model's confidence scores in order to thwart\nattacks, but leave the model's predicted labels unchanged. Our label-only\nattacks demonstrate that confidence-masking is not a viable defense strategy\nagainst membership inference. Finally, we investigate worst-case label-only\nattacks, that infer membership for a small number of outlier data points. We\nshow that label-only attacks also match confidence-based attacks in this\nsetting. We find that training models with differential privacy and (strong) L2\nregularization are the only known defense strategies that successfully prevents\nall attacks. This remains true even when the differential privacy budget is too\nhigh to offer meaningful provable guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 15:44:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 01:42:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 22:45:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

By modeling the system as a probabilistic labeled Markov\ndecision process (PL-MDP), the control objective is to synthesize a\nfinite-memory policy, under which the agent satisfies complex high-level tasks\nexpressed as linear temporal logic (LTL) with desired satisfaction probability.\nIn particular, the cost optimization of the trajectory that satisfies infinite\nhorizon tasks is considered, and the trade-off between reducing the expected\nmean cost and maximizing the probability of task satisfaction is analyzed.\nInstead of using traditional Rabin automata, the LTL formulas are converted to\nlimit-deterministic B\\\"uchi automata (LDBA) with a reachability acceptance\ncondition and a compact graph structure. The novelty of this work lies in\nconsidering the cases where LTL specifications can be potentially infeasible\nand developing a relaxed product MDP between PL-MDP and LDBA. The relaxed\nproduct MDP allows the agent to revise its motion plan whenever the task is not\nfully feasible and quantify the revised plan's violation measurement. A\nmulti-objective optimization problem is then formulated to jointly consider the\nprobability of task satisfaction, the violation with respect to original task\nconstraints, and the implementation cost of the policy execution. The\nformulated problem can be solved via coupled linear programs. To the best of\nour knowledge, this work first bridges the gap between probabilistic planning\nrevision of potential infeasible LTL specifications and optimal control\nsynthesis of both plan prefix and plan suffix of the trajectory over the\ninfinite horizons. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 15:49:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 07:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 06:00:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 01:09:40 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 00:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

The indoor\nrestriction for WLAN devices in 5150-5350 MHz is an example for a regulatory\nmeasure that aims at having WLAN devices operating in an environment that\nprovides sufficient attenuation to enable sharing with other services. In this\npaper we investigate whether an attenuating environment can be automatically\ndetected without user interaction. Instead of detecting an indoor location, we\nare directly looking for a detection of an attenuating environment. The basic\nidea is that signals from global navigation satellite services (GNSS) can be\nreceived practically everywhere on earth where there is a view to the sky.\nWhere these signals are attenuated, the receiving device is assumed to be in an\nattenuating environment. In order to characterize such environment, we evaluate\nthe detectable GNSS satellites and their carrier-to-noise density.

In vitro,\nincubation of CCA cells with CAP-treated culture media (i.e. plasma-activated\nmedia, PAM) led to a dose response decrease in cell survival. At molecular\nlevel, CAP treatment induced double-strand DNA breaks, followed by an increased\nphosphorylation and activation of the cell cycle master regulators CHK1 and\np53, leading to cell cycle arrest and cell death by apoptosis. In conclusion,\nCAP is a novel therapeutic option to consider for CCA in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 20:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-31"}

In this work, two categories of\ninnovative deep-learning based inverse modeling methods are proposed and\ncompared. The first category is deep-learning surrogate-based inversion\nmethods, in which the Theory-guided Neural Network (TgNN) is constructed as a\ndeep-learning surrogate for problems with uncertain model parameters. By\nincorporating physical laws and other constraints, the TgNN surrogate can be\nconstructed with limited simulation runs and accelerate the inversion process\nsignificantly. Three TgNN surrogate-based inversion methods are proposed,\nincluding the gradient method, the iterative ensemble smoother (IES), and the\ntraining method. The second category is direct-deep-learning-inversion methods,\nin which TgNN constrained with geostatistical information, named TgNN-geo, is\nproposed for direct inverse modeling. In TgNN-geo, two neural networks are\nintroduced to approximate the respective random model parameters and the\nsolution. Since the prior geostatistical information can be incorporated, the\ndirect-inversion method based on TgNN-geo works well, even in cases with sparse\nspatial measurements or imprecise prior statistics. Although the proposed\ndeep-learning based inverse modeling methods are general in nature, and thus\napplicable to a wide variety of problems, they are tested with several\nsubsurface flow problems. It is found that satisfactory results are obtained\nwith a high efficiency. Moreover, both the advantages and disadvantages are\nfurther analyzed for the proposed two categories of deep-learning based\ninversion methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 15:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

In practice, the semantic information might be\nrepresented by some latent distribution learned from data. However, such latent\ndistribution may incur difficulties in data sampling for GANs. In this paper,\nrather than sampling from the predefined prior distribution, we propose an\nLCCGAN model with local coordinate coding (LCC) to improve the performance of\ngenerating data.

This attention is a token-wise design and its complexity is\nquadratic to the length of sequence, limiting its application potential for\nlong sequence tasks. In this paper, we propose a dimension-wise attention\nmechanism based on which a novel language modeling approach (namely\nTensorCoder) can be developed. The dimension-wise attention can reduce the\nattention complexity from the original $O(N^2d)$ to $O(Nd^2)$, where $N$ is the\nlength of the sequence and $d$ is the dimensionality of head. We verify\nTensorCoder on two tasks including masked language modeling and neural machine\ntranslation. Compared with the original Transformer, TensorCoder not only\ngreatly reduces the calculation of the original model but also obtains improved\nperformance on masked language modeling task (in PTB dataset) and comparable\nperformance on machine translation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 13:42:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 11:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

Agents are heterogeneous in their\ncharacteristics and are linked in a multi-layered network representing the\nsocial structure - including households, friendships, employment and schools.\nWe explore the interplay of various adoption rates of the contact-tracing app,\ndifferent levels of testing capacity, and behavioural factors to assess the\nimpact on the epidemic. Results suggest that a contact tracing app can\ncontribute substantially to reducing infection rates in the population when\naccompanied by a sufficient testing capacity or when the testing policy\nprioritises symptomatic cases. As user rate increases, prevalence of infection\ndecreases. With that, when symptomatic cases are not prioritised for testing, a\nhigh rate of app users can generate an extensive increase in the demand for\ntesting, which, if not met with adequate supply, may render the app\ncounterproductive. This points to the crucial role of an efficient testing\npolicy and the necessity to upscale testing capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 16:58:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 17:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

A special\nattention has been paid on understanding the resulting plasma electrical\nproperties through an equivalent electrical model whose experimental validity\nhas been demonstrated here. In this model, the interelectrode gap is subdivided\ninto 4 types of elementary domains, according to whether they contain electric\ncharges (or not) and according to their type of medium (gas, seed or\ninsulator). The model enables to study the influence of seeds on the plasma\nelectrical properties by measuring and deducing several parameters (charge per\nfilament, gas capacitance, plasma power, ...) either in no-bed configuration\n(i.e. no seed in the reactor) or in packed-bed configuration (seeds in the\nreactor). In that second case, we have investigated how seeds can influence the\nplasma electrical parameters considering six specimens of seeds (beans,\nradishes, corianders, lentils, sunflowers and corns). The influence of\nmolecular oxygen (0-100 sccm) mixed with a continuous flow rate of helium (2\nslm) is also investigated, especially through filaments breakdown voltages,\ncharge per filament and plasma power. It is demonstrated that such bed-packing\ndrives to an increase in the gas capacitance, to a decrease in the\nbeta-parameter and to variations of the filaments' breakdown voltages in a\nseed-dependent manner. Finally, we show how the equivalent electrical model can\nbe used to assess the total volume of the contact points, the capacitance of\nthe seeds in the packed-bed configuration and we demonstrate that germinative\neffects can be induced by plasma on four of the six agronomical specimens.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 21:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

The measuring principle is the luminescence quenching\nby oxygen molecules, which results in a change of the luminescence decay time\nand intensity. In the classical approach, this change is related to an oxygen\nconcentration using the Stern-Volmer equation. This equation, which in most of\nthe cases is non-linear, is parametrized through device-specific constants.\nTherefore, to determine these parameters every sensor needs to be precisely\ncalibrated at one or more known concentrations. This work explores an entirely\nnew artificial intelligence approach and demonstrates the feasibility of oxygen\nsensing through machine learning. The specifically developed neural network\nlearns very efficiently to relate the input quantities to the oxygen\nconcentration. The results show a mean deviation of the predicted from the\nmeasured concentration of 0.5 percent air, comparable to many commercial and\nlow-cost sensors. Since the network was trained using synthetically generated\ndata, the accuracy of the model predictions is limited by the ability of the\ngenerated data to describe the measured data, opening up future possibilities\nfor significant improvement by using a large number of experimental\nmeasurements for training. The approach described in this work demonstrates the\napplicability of artificial intelligence to sensing of sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 20:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}
