In particular, we only assume that the entries of the ensemble are\ncentered, and have second and fourth moments uniformly bounded away from $0$\nand infinity, whereas previous work assumed a uniform subgaussian decay\ncondition and that the entries within each factor of the product are\nidentically distributed.\n  A consequence of our least singular value bound is that the four moment\nmatching universality results for the products of independent random matrices,\nrecently obtained by Koppel, O'Rourke, and Vu, hold under much weaker\nhypotheses. Our proof technique is also of independent interest in the study of\nstructured sparse matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 16:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

To this\nend, we propose TagSee, a multi-person imaging system based on monostatic RFID\nimaging. TagSee is based on the insight that when customers are browsing the\nitems on a shelf, they stand between the tags deployed along the boundaries of\nthe shelf and the reader, which changes the multi-paths that the RFID signals\ntravel along, and both the RSS and phase values of the RFID signals that the\nreader receives change. Based on these variations observed by the reader,\nTagSee constructs a coarse grained image of the customers. Afterwards, TagSee\nidentifies the items that are being browsed by the customers by analyzing the\nconstructed images. The key novelty of this paper is on achieving browsing\nbehavior monitoring of multiple customers in front of display items by\nconstructing coarse grained images via robust, analytical model-driven deep\nlearning based, RFID imaging. To achieve this, we first mathematically\nformulate the problem of imaging humans using monostatic RFID devices and\nderive an approximate analytical imaging model that correlates the variations\ncaused by human obstructions in the RFID signals. Based on this model, we then\ndevelop a deep learning framework to robustly image customers with high\naccuracy. We implement TagSee scheme using a Impinj Speedway R420 reader and\nSMARTRAC DogBone RFID tags.

We derive the\nviscosity-varying adjoint Navier-Stokes equations, where gradients in viscosity\nforce both the adjoint momentum and the adjoint scalar (here temperature). By\nthe technique of direct-adjoint looping, we obtain the nonlinear optimal\nperturbation which maximises the perturbation kinetic energy of the nonlinear\nsystem. While we study three-dimensional plane Poiseuille (channel) flow with\nthe walls at different temperatures, and a temperature-dependent viscosity, our\nfindings are general for any flow with viscosity variations near walls. The Orr\nand modified lift-up mechanisms are in operation at low and high perturbation\namplitudes respectively at our subcritical Reynolds number. The nonlinear\noptimal perturbation contains more energy on the hot (less-viscous) side, with\na stronger initial lift-up. However, as the flow evolves, the important\ndynamics shifts to the cold (more-viscous) side, where wide high-speed streaks\nof low viscosity grow and persist, and strengthen the inflectional quality of\nthe velocity profile. We provide a physical description of this process, and\nshow that the evolution of the linear optimal perturbation misses most of the\nphysics. The Prandtl number does not qualitatively affect the findings at these\ntimes. The study of nonlinear optimal perturbations is still in its infancy,\nand viscosity variations are ubiquitous.

Style transfer techniques\nwith machine learning models have helped us address this challenge with the\nvisual style of a specific painting. However, other manual elements of style,\ni.e., painting techniques and brushstrokes of an artist, have not been fully\naddressed.

Motivated by such applications, this work proposes decentralized\npolicies for the real-time monitoring and estimation of autoregressive\nprocesses over random access channels. Two classes of policies are\ninvestigated: (i) oblivious schemes in which sampling and transmission policies\nare independent of the processes that are monitored, and (ii) non-oblivious\nschemes in which transmitters causally observe their corresponding processes\nfor decision making. In the class of oblivious policies, we show that\nminimizing the expected time-average estimation error is equivalent to\nminimizing the expected age of information. Consequently, we prove lower and\nupper bounds on the minimum achievable estimation error in this class. Next, we\nconsider non-oblivious policies and design a threshold policy, called\nerror-based thinning, in which each source node becomes active if its\ninstantaneous error has crossed a fixed threshold (which we optimize). Active\nnodes then transmit stochastically following a slotted ALOHA policy. A\nclosed-form, approximately optimal, solution is found for the threshold as well\nas the resulting estimation error. It is shown that non-oblivious policies\noffer a multiplicative gain close to $3$ compared to oblivious policies.\nMoreover, it is shown that oblivious policies that use the age of information\nfor decision making improve the state-of-the-art at least by the multiplicative\nfactor $2$.

The\nverification framework generalizes an existing one based on Constrained Horn\nClauses (CHCs) to arbitrary clauses, function variables, and well-foundedness\nconstraints. While it is known that the satisfiability of CHCs and the validity\nof queries for Constrained Logic Programs (CLP) are inter-reducible, we show\nthat, thanks to the added expressiveness, pCSP is expressive enough to express\nmuCLP queries. muCLP itself is a new extension of CLP that we propose in this\npaper.

We present calculations of charge and weak\nnuclear form factors and CE$\\nu$NS cross sections on $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O,\n$^{40}$Ar, $^{56}$Fe and $^{208}$Pb nuclei. We obtain the proton and neutron\ndensities, and charge and weak form factors by solving Hartree--Fock (HF)\nequations with a Skyrme (SkE2) nuclear potential. We validate our approach by\ncomparing $^{208}$Pb and $^{40}$Ar charge form factor predictions with\navailable elastic electron scattering data. Since CE$\\nu$NS experiments at\nstopped--pion sources are also well suited to measure inelastic\ncharged--current and neutral--current neutrino--nucleus cross sections, we also\npresent calculations for these processes, incorporating a continuum Random\nPhase Approximation (CRPA) description on top of the HF-SkE2 picture of the\nnucleus. Providing both coherent as well as inelastic cross sections in a\nconsistent framework, we aim at obtaining a reliable and detailed comparison of\nthe strength of these processes in the energy region below ~100 MeV.\nFurthermore, we attempt to gauge the level of theoretical uncertainty\npertaining to the description of the $^{40}$Ar form factor and CE$\\nu$NS cross\nsections by comparing relative differences between recent microscopic nuclear\ntheory and widely--used phenomenological form factor predictions. Future\nprecision measurements of CE$\\nu$NS will potentially help in constraining these\nnuclear structure details that will in turn improve prospects of extracting new\nphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 17:49:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 16:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

Different from the outer disc, the inner disc stars exhibit a clear\nbimodal distribution in the [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane. While a number of scenarios\nhave been proposed in the literature, it remains challenging to recover this\nbimodal distribution with theoretical models. To this end, we present a\nchemical evolution model embedding a complex multi-phase inner disc formation\nscenario that matches the observed bimodal [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution. In this\nscenario, the formation of the inner disc is dominated by two main starburst\nepisodes 6 Gyr apart with secular, low-level star formation activity in\nbetween. In our model, the first starburst occurs at early cosmic times (t~1\nGyr) and the second one 6 Gyr later at a cosmic time of t~7 Gyr. Both these\nstarburst episodes are associated with gas accretion events in our model, and\nare quenched rapidly. The first starburst leads to the formation of the\nhigh-$\\alpha$ sequence, and the second starburst leads to the formation of the\nmetal-poor low-$\\alpha$ sequence. The metal-rich low-$\\alpha$ stars, instead,\nform during the secular evolution phase between the two bursts. Our model shows\nthat the $\\alpha$-dichotomy originates from the rapid suppression of star\nformation after the first starburst. The two starburst episodes are likely to\nbe responsible for the formation of the geometric thick disc (z >1 kpc), with\nthe old inner thick disc and the young outer thick disc forming during the\nfirst and the second starbursts, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 23:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

To address this challenge, we introduce the\nSoft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). This framework holds for superhorizon\nmodes whose comoving momentum is far below the UV scale, which is set by the\ninverse comoving horizon. The SdSET is formulated using the same approach that\nyields the Heavy Quark Effective Theory. The degrees of freedom that capture\nthe long wavelength dynamics are identified with the growing and decaying\nsolutions to the equations of motion. The operator expansion is organized using\na power counting scheme, and loops can be regulated while respecting the low\nenergy symmetries. For massive quantum fields in a fixed de Sitter background,\npower counting implies that all interactions beyond the horizon are irrelevant.\nAlternatively, if the fields are very light, the leading interactions are at\nmost marginal, and resumming the associated logarithms using (dynamical)\nrenormalization group techniques yields the evolution equation for canonical\nstochastic inflation. The SdSET is also applicable to models where gravity is\ndynamical, including inflation. In this case, diffeomorphism invariance ensures\nthat all interactions are irrelevant, trivially implying the all-orders\nconservation of adiabatic density fluctuations and gravitational waves. We\nbriefly touch on the application to slow-roll eternal inflation by identifying\nnovel relevant operators. This work serves to demystify many aspects of\nperturbation theory outside the horizon, and has a variety of applications to\nproblems of cosmological interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

The aim of this work was\nto develop a physics-informed machine learning model capable of predicting\n$\\eta(T)$ of oxide liquids. Instead of predicting the viscosity itself, the NN\npredicts the parameters of the MYEGA viscosity equation: the liquid's fragility\nindex, the glass transition temperature, and the asymptotic viscosity. With\nthese parameters, $\\eta$ can be computed at any temperature of interest, with\nthe advantage of good extrapolation capabilities inherent to the MYEGA\nequation. The dataset was collected from the SciGlass database; only oxide\nliquids with enough data points in the high and low viscosity regions were\nselected, resulting in a final dataset with 17,584 data points containing 847\ndifferent liquids. About 600 features were engineered from the liquids'\nchemical composition and 35 of these features were selected using a feature\nselection protocol. The hyperparameter (HP) tuning of the NN was performed in a\nset of experiments using both random search and Bayesian strategies, where a\ntotal of 700 HP sets were tested. The most successful HP sets were further\ntested using 10-fold cross-validation, and the one with the lowest average\nvalidation loss was selected as the best set.

We find two major reasons for\nmisclassification: inherent ambiguity in the orbit of the object - for\ninstance, an object that is on the edge of resonance - and a lack of\nrepresentative examples in the training set.

The principle\nis to train a deep neural network (DNN) to predict the solutions of an optimal\npower flow (OPF), thus shifting the computational effort from real-time to\noffline. Nonetheless, before training this DNN, one has to solve a large number\nof OPFs to create a labeled dataset. Granted the latter step can still be\nprohibitive in time-critical applications, this work puts forth an original\ntechnique for improving the prediction accuracy of DNNs by taking into account\nthe sensitivities of the OPF minimizers with respect to the OPF parameters. By\nexpanding on multiparametric programming, it is shown that although inverter\ncontrol problems may exhibit dual degeneracy, the required sensitivities do\nexist in general and can be computed readily using the output of any standard\nquadratic program (QP) solver. Numerical tests showcase that\nsensitivity-informed deep learning can enhance prediction accuracy in terms of\nmean square error (MSE) by 2-3 orders of magnitude at minimal computational\noverhead. Improvements are more significant in the small-data regime, where a\nDNN has to learn to optimize using a few examples.

In particular, we propose an efficient solution to a hard\ncombinatorial search problem that arises when decoding elements of a VSA data\nstructure: the factorization of products of multiple code vectors. Our proposed\nalgorithm, called a resonator network, is a new type of recurrent neural\nnetwork that interleaves VSA multiplication operations and pattern completion.\nWe show in two examples -- parsing of a tree-like data structure and parsing of\na visual scene -- how the factorization problem arises and how the resonator\nnetwork can solve it. More broadly, resonator networks open the possibility to\napply VSAs to myriad artificial intelligence problems in real-world domains. A\ncompanion paper (Kent et al., 2020) presents a rigorous analysis and evaluation\nof the performance of resonator networks, showing it out-performs alternative\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 19:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

Many low-diameter topologies such as Slim Fly or Jellyfish that\nsubstantially reduce cost, power consumption, and latency have been proposed. A\nkey challenge in realizing the benefits of these topologies is routing. On one\nhand, these networks provide shorter path lengths than established topologies\nsuch as Clos or torus, leading to performance improvements. On the other hand,\nthe number of shortest paths between each pair of endpoints is much smaller\nthan in Clos, but there is a large number of non-minimal paths between router\npairs. This hampers or even makes it impossible to use established multipath\nrouting schemes such as ECMP. In this work, to facilitate high-performance\nrouting in modern networks, we analyze existing routing protocols and\narchitectures, focusing on how well they exploit the diversity of minimal and\nnon-minimal paths. We first develop a taxonomy of different forms of support\nfor multipathing and overall path diversity. Then, we analyze how existing\nrouting schemes support this diversity. Among others, we consider multipathing\nwith both shortest and non-shortest paths, support for disjoint paths, or\nenabling adaptivity. To address the ongoing convergence of HPC and \"Big Data\"\ndomains, we consider routing protocols developed for both HPC systems and for\ndata centers as well as general clusters.

Any of these equations or systems of equations could be\nreferred to as a Majorana equation or Majorana system of equations because it\ncan be used to describe the Majorana particle. For example, in the Weyl\nrepresentation, in (3+1) dimensions, we can have two non-equivalent explicitly\ncovariant complex first-order equations; in contrast, in (1+1) dimensions, we\nhave a complex system of coupled equations. In any case, whichever equation or\nsystem of equations is used, the wave function that describes the Majorana\nparticle in (3+1) or (1+1) dimensions is determined by four or two real\nquantities. The aim of this paper is to study and discuss all these issues from\nan algebraic point of view, highlighting the similarities and differences that\narise between these equations in the cases of (3+1) and (1+1) dimensions in the\nDirac, Weyl, and Majorana representations. Additionally, to reinforce this\ntask, we rederive and use results that come from a procedure already introduced\nby Case to obtain a two-component Majorana equation in (3+1) dimensions.\nLikewise, we introduce for the first time a somewhat analogous procedure in\n(1+1) dimensions and then use the results we obtain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 21:14:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2021 19:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-27"}

The forces required for these mechanical functions\nhave been deduced from mechano-chemical models of actin polymerization; most\nmodels are focused on single growing filaments, and only a few address\npolymerization of filament networks through simulations. Here we propose a\ncontinuum model of surface growth and filament nucleation to describe\npolymerization of dendritic actin networks.

The microscopic processes\nunderlying polymerization are subsumed into kinetic laws characterizing the\nchange of filament density and the propagation of growing surfaces. This\ncontinuum model can predict the evolution of actin networks in disparate\nexperiments. A key conclusion of the analysis is that existing laws relating\nforce to polymerization speed of single filaments cannot predict the response\nof growing networks. Therefore a new kinetic law, consistent with the\ndissipation inequality, is proposed to capture the evolution of dendritic actin\nnetworks under different loading conditions.

Our envisioned framework enables two D2D links to share certain\northogonal radio resource blocks (RRBs) by forming device-clusters. In each\ndevice-cluster, both content-holder device-users (DUs) transmit to the\ncontent-requester DUs via an enhanced remote radio head (eRRH) over the same\nRRBs. Such RRBs are shared with the uplink F-RAN as well. The intra\ndevice-cluster interference is mitigated by exploiting both uplink and downlink\nrate-splitting schemes, and the inter device-cluster interference is mitigated\nby using an orthogonal RRB allocation strategy. Our objective is to maximize\nthe end-to-end sum-rate of the device-clusters while reducing the interference\nbetween D2D cooperation and the uplink F-RAN over the shared RRBs. Towards this\nobjective, a joint optimization of device-clustering, transmit power\nallocations, assignment of device-clusters to the eRRHs, and allocation of RRBs\namong the device-clusters is presented.

Despite their promising performance, deep networks have\nshown sensitivities to perturbations of their inputs (e.g., adversarial\nexamples) and their learned feature representations are often difficult to\ninterpret, raising concerns about their true capability and trustworthiness.\nRecent work in adversarial training, a form of robust optimization in which the\nmodel is optimized against adversarial examples, demonstrates the ability to\nimprove performance sensitivities to perturbations and yield feature\nrepresentations that are more interpretable. Adversarial training, however,\ncomes with an increased computational cost over that of standard (i.e.,\nnonrobust) training, rendering it impractical for use in large-scale problems.\nRecent work suggests that a fast approximation to adversarial training shows\npromise for reducing training time and maintaining robustness in the presence\nof perturbations bounded by the infinity norm. In this work, we demonstrate\nthat this approach extends to the Euclidean norm and preserves the\nhuman-aligned feature representations that are common for robust models.\nAdditionally, we show that using a distributed training scheme can further\nreduce the time to train robust deep networks. Fast adversarial training is a\npromising approach that will provide increased security and explainability in\nmachine learning applications for which robust optimization was previously\nthought to be impractical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 00:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

The heart of\napplication layer clock is the hardware clock and hence application layer clock\nskew will be same as of physical layer and can be corrected from symbol timing\nrecovery process.

To overcome the limitations of regular 3D representations,\nwe propose Parametric Model-Conditioned Implicit Representation (PaMIR), which\ncombines the parametric body model with the free-form deep implicit function.\nIn our PaMIR-based reconstruction framework, a novel deep neural network is\nproposed to regularize the free-form deep implicit function using the semantic\nfeatures of the parametric model, which improves the generalization ability\nunder the scenarios of challenging poses and various clothing topologies.\nMoreover, a novel depth-ambiguity-aware training loss is further integrated to\nresolve depth ambiguities and enable successful surface detail reconstruction\nwith imperfect body reference. Finally, we propose a body reference\noptimization method to improve the parametric model estimation accuracy and to\nenhance the consistency between the parametric model and the implicit function.\nWith the PaMIR representation, our framework can be easily extended to\nmulti-image input scenarios without the need of multi-camera calibration and\npose synchronization.

The default algorithm\nfor this job is beam search -- a pruned version of breadth-first search. Quite\nsurprisingly, beam search often returns better results than exact inference due\nto beneficial search bias for NLP tasks. In this work, we show that the\nstandard implementation of beam search can be made up to 10x faster in\npractice. Our method assumes that the scoring function is monotonic in the\nsequence length, which allows us to safely prune hypotheses that cannot be in\nthe final set of hypotheses early on. We devise effective monotonic\napproximations to popular nonmonontic scoring functions, including length\nnormalization and mutual information decoding.

The cross-sectional\ndependence is described through a linear regression model. We study three tests\nnamed the sum test, the max test and the max-sum test, where the latter two are\nnew. The sum test is initially proposed by Breusch and Pagan (1980). We design\nthe max and sum tests for sparse and non-sparse residuals in the linear\nregressions, respectively.And the max-sum test is devised to compromise both\nsituations on the residuals. Indeed, our simulation shows that the max-sum test\noutperforms the previous two tests. This makes the max-sum test very useful in\npractice where sparsity or not for a set of data is usually vague. Towards the\ntheoretical analysis of the three tests, we have settled two conjectures\nregarding the sum of squares of sample correlation coefficients asked by\nPesaran (2004 and 2008). In addition, we establish the asymptotic theory for\nmaxima of sample correlations coefficients appeared in the linear regression\nmodel for panel data, which is also the first successful attempt to our\nknowledge. To study the max-sum test, we create a novel method to show\nasymptotic independence between maxima and sums of dependent random variables.\nWe expect the method itself is useful for other problems of this nature.\nFinally, an extensive simulation study as well as a case study are carried out.\nThey demonstrate advantages of our proposed methods in terms of both empirical\npowers and robustness for residuals regardless of sparsity or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 06:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

Second, access to research papers\nis restricted to only subscribers, and even the authors cannot access their own\npapers. To address the above problems, we propose Open-Pub, a decentralized,\ntransparent yet privacy-preserving academic publication scheme using the\nblockchain technology.

With this strong double-blind mechanism,\nauthors can choose to submit papers anonymously, and validators distribute\npapers anonymously to reviewers on the blockchain according to their research\ninterests.

If an astrophysically\ncompact source, such as a Fast Radio Burst (FRB), is observed through a region\nwith a high optical depth of such microlensing masses, this gravitational\nlensing time delay can be imprinted on short timescale transient signals. In\nthis paper, we consider the impact of the parity of the macroimage on the\nresultant microlensing time delays. It is found that this parity is directly\nimprinted on the microlensing signal, with macroimages formed at minima of the\ntime arrival surface beginning with the most highly magnified microimages and\nthen progressing to the fainter microimages. At macroimages at the maxima of\nthe time arrival surface, this situation is reversed, with fainter images\nobserved first and finishing with the brightest microimages. For macroimages at\nsaddle-points, the signal again begins with fainter images, followed by\nbrighter images before again fading through the fainter microimages. The\ngrowing populations of cosmologically distant bursty transient sources will\nundoubtedly result in the discovery of strong lensed, multiply imaged FRBs,\nwhich will be susceptible to microlensing by compact masses. With the temporal\nresolution being offered my modern and future facilities, the detection of\nmicrolensing induced time delays will reveal the parities of the gravitational\nlens macroimages, providing additional constraints on macrolensing mass models\nand improving the efficacy of these transient sources as a cosmological probes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 06:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

Notwithstanding its success\nacross disciplines, the recent trend of the overuse of deep learning is\nconcerning to many machine learning practitioners. Recently, seismologists have\nalso demonstrated the efficacy of deep learning algorithms in detecting low\nmagnitude earthquakes. Here, we revisit the problem of seismic event detection\nbut using a logistic regression model with feature extraction. We select\nwell-discriminating features from a huge database of time-series operations\ncollected from interdisciplinary time-series analysis methods. Using a simple\nlearning model with only five trainable parameters, we detect several\nlow-magnitude induced earthquakes from the Groningen gas field that are not\npresent in the catalog. We note that the added advantage of simpler models is\nthat the selected features add to our understanding of the noise and event\nclasses present in the dataset. Since simpler models are easy to maintain,\ndebug, understand, and train, through this study we underscore that it might be\na dangerous pursuit to use deep learning without carefully weighing simpler\nalternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 07:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

They can represent\nrich spaces of functions while preserving the convexity of the optimization\nproblems where they are used, and are simple to evaluate, differentiate and\nintegrate. However, for modeling non-negative functions, which are crucial for\nunsupervised learning, density estimation, or non-parametric Bayesian methods,\nlinear models are not applicable directly. Moreover, current state-of-the-art\nmodels like generalized linear models either lead to non-convex optimization\nproblems, or cannot be easily integrated. In this paper we provide the first\nmodel for non-negative functions which benefits from the same good properties\nof linear models. In particular, we prove that it admits a representer theorem\nand provide an efficient dual formulation for convex problems. We study its\nrepresentation power, showing that the resulting space of functions is strictly\nricher than that of generalized linear models. Finally we extend the model and\nthe theoretical results to functions with outputs in convex cones. The paper is\ncomplemented by an experimental evaluation of the model showing its\neffectiveness in terms of formulation, algorithmic derivation and practical\nresults on the problems of density estimation, regression with heteroscedastic\nerrors, and multiple quantile regression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 07:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

The twinless strongly connected components (TSCCs) of a directed graph\n$G$ are its maximal twinless strongly connected subgraphs. These concepts have\nseveral diverse applications, such as the design of telecommunication networks\nand the structural stability of buildings. A vertex $v \\in V$ is a twinless\nstrong articulation point of $G$ if the deletion of $v$ increases the number of\nTSCCs of $G$. Here, we present the first linear-time algorithm that finds all\nthe twinless strong articulation points of a directed graph. We show that the\ncomputation of twinless strong articulation points reduces to the following\nproblem in undirected graphs, which may be of independent interest: Given a\n$2$-vertex-connected (biconnected) undirected graph $H$, find all vertices $v$\nthat belong to a vertex-edge cut-pair, i.e., for which there exists an edge $e$\nsuch that $H \\setminus \\{v,e\\}$ is not connected. We develop a linear-time\nalgorithm that not only finds all such vertices $v$, but also computes the\nnumber of edges $e$ such that $H \\setminus \\{v,e\\}$ is not connected. This also\nimplies that for each twinless strong articulation point $v$ which is not a\nstrong articulation point in a strongly connected digraph $G$, we can compute\nthe number of TSCCs in $G \\setminus v$. We note that the problem of computing\nall vertices that belong to a vertex-edge cut-pair can be solved in linear-time\nby exploiting the structure of $3$-vertex-connected (triconnected) components\nof $H$, represented by an SPQR tree of $H$. Our approach, however, is\nconceptually simple, and thus likely to be more amenable to practical\nimplementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 07:32:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 22:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

Previous work using imitation learning indicates the\nfeasibility of acquiring a node selection policy, by learning an adaptive node\nsearching order. In contrast, our imitation learning policy is focused solely\non learning which of a node's children to select. We present an offline method\nto learn such a policy in two settings: one that comprises a heuristic by\ncommitting to pruning of nodes; one that is exact and backtracks from a leaf to\nguarantee finding the optimal integer solution. The former setting corresponds\nto a child selector during plunging, while the latter is akin to a diving\nheuristic. We apply the policy within the popular open-source solver SCIP, in\nboth heuristic and exact settings. Empirical results on five MIP datasets\nindicate that our node selection policy leads to solutions significantly more\nquickly than the state-of-the-art precedent in the literature. While we do not\nbeat the highly-optimised SCIP state-of-practice baseline node selector in\nterms of solving time on exact solutions, our heuristic policies have a\nconsistently better optimality gap than all baselines, if the accuracy of the\npredictive model is sufficient. Further, the results also indicate that, when a\ntime limit is applied, our heuristic method finds better solutions than all\nbaselines in the majority of problems tested. We explain the results by showing\nthat the learned policies have imitated the SCIP baseline, but without the\nlatter's early plunge abort. Our recommendation is that, despite the clear\nimprovements over the literature, this kind of MIP child selector is better\nseen in a broader approach using learning in MIP branch-and-bound tree\ndecisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 08:12:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 21:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

After explaining the assumed data-generating process and providing\nformal definitions of stable trait factors, within-person variability scores,\nand joint effects of time-varying treatments at the within-person level, we\nintroduce the proposed method, which consists of a two-step analysis.\nWithin-person variability scores for each person, which are disaggregated from\nstable traits of that person, are first calculated using weights based on a\nbest linear correlation preserving predictor through structural equation\nmodeling (SEM). Causal parameters are then estimated via a potential outcome\napproach, either marginal structural models (MSMs) or structural nested mean\nmodels (SNMMs), using calculated within-person variability scores. Unlike the\napproach that relies entirely on SEM, the present method does not assume\nlinearity for observed time-varying confounders at the within-person level. We\nemphasize the use of SNMMs with G-estimation because of its property of being\ndoubly robust to model misspecifications in how observed time-varying\nconfounders are functionally related with treatments/predictors and outcomes at\nthe within-person level.

Furthermore, we show that the\ntransformation channel between the silicon vacancy (VSi) and CAV is effectively\nblocked under n-type conditions, but becomes available in samples where the\nFermi level has moved towards the center of the band gap due to\nirradiation-induced donor compensation.

Going to higher\ntemperatures, a decay of the CAV pair density is reported which is closely\ncorrelated to a renewed increase of VC concentration. A conceivable explanation\nfor this process is the dissociation of the CAV pair into separate carbon\nanitisites and VC defects. Lastly, the presented data supports the claim that\nthe removal of free carriers in irradiated SiC is due to introduced\ncompensating defects and not passivation of shallow nitrogen donors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 09:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

Since time synchronization is\nextremely costly in these networks, application of asynchronous methods like\nquorum-based protocols have attracted increased interest for their suitability.\nThis is because Quorum-based protocols can guarantee that two nodes with\ndiffering clock times have an intersection within at least one timeslot. A\nhigher neighbour discovery rate of active nodes is desired, but it also results\nin a higher active ratio and consequently and adversely more overall power\nconsumption of the nodes and a shorter network lifetime. There must be a\ntrade-off between extensive neighbour discovery and active ratio in order to\ndesign high-performance and efficient protocols. In this paper, two novel\nasynchronous quorum-based protocols to maximize the neighbour discovery and\nminimize the active ratio have been designed and presented. A new metric\n(Quorum Efficiency Ratio: QER) has also been designed to evaluate and compare\nthe performance of quorum-based protocols in terms of their neighbour discovery\n(the Expected Quorum Overlap Size: EQOS) and the active ratio. The EQOS has\nbeen theoretically derived, along with the Active Ratio and the QER values for\nthe proposed novel protocols and the other contemporary protocols.

One of the few promising theoretical resolutions of this\ntension is to invoke new physics that changes the sound horizon scale in the\nearly universe; this can bring CMB and BAO constraints on $H_0$ into better\nagreement with local measurements. In this paper, we discuss how a measurement\nof the Hubble constant can be made from the CMB without using information from\nthe sound horizon scale, $r_s$. In particular, we show how measurements of the\nCMB lensing power spectrum can be used to place interesting constraints on\n$H_0$ when combined with measurements of either supernovae or galaxy weak\nlensing, which constrain the matter density parameter. The constraints arise\nfrom the sensitivity of the CMB lensing power spectrum to the horizon scale at\nmatter-radiation equality (in projection); this scale could have a different\ndependence on new physics than the sound horizon. From an analysis of current\nCMB lensing data from Planck and Pantheon supernovae with conservative external\npriors, we derive an $r_s$-independent constraint of $H_0 = 73.5\\pm 5.3$\nkm/s/Mpc. Forecasts for future CMB surveys indicate that improving constraints\nbeyond an error of $\\sigma(H_0) = 3$ km/s/Mpc will be difficult with CMB\nlensing, although applying similar methods to the galaxy power spectrum may\nallow for further improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 10:24:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 20:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-18"}

Second, forward-scattered\nradiation reduces contrast in projection images and introduces artifacts in 3-D\nreconstructions. While conventionally employed anti-scatter grids improve image\nquality by blocking X-rays, the additional attenuation due to the anti-scatter\ngrid at the detector needs to be compensated for by a higher patient entrance\ndose. This also increases the room dose affecting the staff caring for the\npatient.

A deeper characterization has been carried out, by\nmonitoring the temperature dependence of the I-V characteristics and the\nbehavior of the relevant parameters $\\Phi$B and n. The increase of the barrier\nheight and decrease of the ideality factor with increasing temperature\nindicated a lateral inhomogeneity of the WC/4H-SiC Schottky contact, which was\ndescribed by invoking the Tung's model.

With this coding scheme, neurons fire at most once\nper stimulus, but the firing order carries information. Here, we introduce\nBS4NN, a modification of S4NN in which the synaptic weights are constrained to\nbe binary (+1 or -1), in order to decrease memory (ideally, one bit per\nsynapse) and computation footprints. This was done using two sets of weights:\nfirstly, real-valued weights, updated by gradient descent, and used in the\nbackward pass of backpropagation, and secondly, their signs, used in the\nforward pass. Similar strategies have been used to train (non-spiking)\nbinarized neural networks. The main difference is that BS4NN operates in the\ntime domain: spikes are propagated sequentially, and different neurons may\nreach their threshold at different times, which increases computational power.\nWe validated BS4NN on two popular benchmarks, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, and\nobtained reasonable accuracies for this sort of network (97.0% and 87.3%\nrespectively) with a negligible accuracy drop with respect to real-valued\nweights (0.4% and 0.7%, respectively).

We\nfind that domestic manufacturing firms become, on average, between 7% and 12%\nmore productive after hiring the first foreign managers, whereas foreign-owned\nfirms register no significant improvement. In particular, we test that previous\nindustry-specific experience is the primary driver of productivity gains in\ndomestic firms (15.6%), in a way that allows the latter to catch up with\nforeign-owned firms. Managers from the European Union are highly valuable, as\nthey represent about half of the recruits in our data. Our identification\nstrategy combines matching techniques, difference-in-difference, and\npre-recruitment trends to challenge reverse causality. Results are robust to\nplacebo tests and to different estimators of Total Factor Productivity.\nEventually, we argue that upcoming limits to the mobility of foreign talents\nafter the Brexit event can hamper the allocation of productive managerial\nresources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 12:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

Let\n$\\Lambda\\subset\\mathbb{Z}^2$ be a finite box. Particles perform simple\nexclusion on $\\Lambda$, but when they occupy neighboring sites they feel a\nbinding energy $-U_1<0$ in the horizontal direction and $-U_2<0$ in the\nvertical one. Thus the Kawasaki dynamics is conservative inside the volume\n$\\Lambda$.

Solutions to this problem are an active research topic. We focus on\nstrategies to make the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) solver resilient\nagainst node failures, specifically, the exact state reconstruction (ESR)\nmethod, which exploits redundancies in PCG.\n  Reducing the frequency at which redundant information is stored lessens the\nruntime overhead. However, after the node failure, the solver must restart from\nthe last iteration for which redundant information was stored, which increases\nrecovery overhead. This formulation highlights the method's similarities to\ncheckpoint-restart (CR). Thus, this method, which we call ESR with periodic\nstorage (ESRP), can be considered a form of algorithm-based checkpoint-restart.\nThe state is stored implicitly, by exploiting redundancy inherent to the\nalgorithm, rather than explicitly as in CR. We also minimize the amount of data\nto be stored and retrieved compared to CR, but additional computation is\nrequired to reconstruct the solver's state. In this paper, we describe the\nnecessary modifications to ESR to convert it into ESRP, and perform an\nexperimental evaluation.\n  We compare ESRP experimentally with previously-existing ESR and\napplication-level in-memory CR. Our results confirm that the overhead for ESR\nis reduced significantly, both in the failure-free case, and if node failures\nare introduced. In the former case, the overhead of ESRP is usually lower than\nthat of CR. However, CR is faster if node failures happen.

However, PoSH Auto-sklearn introduces even more ways of\nrunning AutoML and might make it harder for users to set it up correctly.\nTherefore, we also go one step further and study the design space of AutoML\nitself, proposing a solution towards truly hands-free AutoML. Together, these\nchanges give rise to the next generation of our AutoML system, Auto-sklearn\n2.0. We verify the improvements by these additions in an extensive experimental\nstudy on 39 AutoML benchmark datasets. We conclude the paper by comparing to\nother popular AutoML frameworks and Auto-sklearn 1.0, reducing the relative\nerror by up to a factor of 4.5, and yielding a performance in 10 minutes that\nis substantially better than what Auto-sklearn 1.0 achieves within an hour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 12:41:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 08:09:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 12:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

The original PoW mining scheme is designed to\nconsider one block at a time and assign a reward to the first place winner of a\ncomputation race. To reduce the mining-related energy consumption, we propose\nto compensate the computation effort of the runner(s)-up of a mining round, by\ngranting them exclusivity of solving the upcoming block in the next round. This\nwill considerably reduce the number of competing nodes in the next round and\nconsequently, the consumed energy. Our proposed scheme divides time into\nepochs, where each comprises two mining rounds; in the first one, all network\nnodes can participate in the mining process, whereas in the second round only\nrunners-up can take part. Thus, the overall mining energy consumption can be\nreduced to nearly $50\\%$. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed scheme is\nthe first to considerably improve the energy consumption of the original PoW\nalgorithm.

The ionosphere is a\nnitrogen plasma with a few percent of methane and hydrogen. Carbon from methane\nenables the formation of macromolecules with long organic chains, finally\nleading to the organic aerosols. On the other hand, we suspect that hydrogen\nand the protonated ions have a different erosive effect on the aerosols. Here\nwe experimentally studied the effect of hydrogen and protonated species on\norganic aerosols. Analogues of Titan's aerosols were formed in a CCP RF plasma\ndischarge in 95% N2 and 5% CH4. Thereafter, the aerosols were exposed to a DC\nplasma in 99% N2 and 1% H2. Samples were analysed by scanning electron\nmicroscopy and in situ infrared transmission spectroscopy. Two pellet\ntechniques - KBr pressed pellets and thin metallic grids - were compared to\nconfirm that modifications seen are not due to the material used to make the\npellet. We observed that the spherical aerosols of ~500 nm in diameter were\neroded under N2-H2 plasma exposure, with the formation of holes of ~10 nm at\ntheir surface. Aerosols were globally removed from the pellet by the plasma. IR\nspectra showed a faster disappearance of isonitriles and/or carbo-diimides\ncompared to the global band of nitriles. The opposite effect was seen with\nbeta-unsaturated nitriles and/or cyanamides. Double bonds as C=C and C=N were\nmore affected than amines and C-H bonds. N-H and C-H absorption bands kept a\nsimilar ratio in intensity and their shape did not vary. Therefore, it seems\nthat carbon and hydrogen play opposite roles in Titan's ionosphere: the carbon\nfrom methane lead to organic growth while hydrogen and protonated species erode\nthe aerosols and react preferentially with unsaturated chemical functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 12:54:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 20:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

Every (fixed-size) DPP is an (fixed-size)\nextended L-ensemble, including projection DPPs. This new formalism enables to\nintroduce and analyze a subclass of DPPs, called partial-projection DPPs.\nSecondly, with these new definitions in hand, we first show that\npartial-projection DPPs arise as perturbative limits of L-ensembles, that is,\nlimits in $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$ of L-ensembles based on matrices of the\nform $\\varepsilon \\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B}$ where $\\mathbf{B}$ is low-rank.

To\nfacilitate a better understanding of the adversarial vulnerability on FR, we\ndevelop an adversarial robustness evaluation library on FR named\n\\textbf{RobFR}, which serves as a reference for evaluating the robustness of\ndownstream tasks. Specifically, RobFR involves 15 popular naturally trained FR\nmodels, 9 models with representative defense mechanisms and 2 commercial FR API\nservices, to perform the robustness evaluation by using various adversarial\nattacks as an important surrogate. The evaluations are conducted under diverse\nadversarial settings in terms of dodging and impersonation, $\\ell_2$ and\n$\\ell_\\infty$, as well as white-box and black-box attacks.

We analyse\nthe formation and the evolution of central solitonic cores, which are found to\nleave their imprints on dark matter density profiles, resulting in shallower\ncentral densities, and on rotation curves, producing an additional circular\nvelocity peak at small radii from the center. We find that the suppression of\nstructures due to the quantum nature of the scalar field results in an\nshallower halo mass function in the low-mass end compared to the case of a\n$\\Lambda$CDM simulation, in which dark matter is expected to cluster at all\nmass scales even if evolved with the same initial conditions used for fuzzy\ndark matter. Furthermore, we verify the scaling relations characterising the\nsolution to the Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Poisson system, for both isolated and merging\nhalos, and we find that they are preserved by merging processes.

An analysis of distributions shows that the\ncritical behavior of the spin correlation length is defined by ferromagnetic or\nantiferromagnetic sequences, while the critical behavior of the impurity\ncorrelation length is defined by the sequences of impurities or by the\ncharge-ordered sequences. For the dilute Ising chain, there are no other\nrepeating sequences whose mean length diverges at zero temperature. While both\nthe spin correlation and the impurity correlation lengths can diverge only at\nzero temperature, the ordering processes result in a maximum of the specific\nheat at finite temperature defined by the maximum rate of change of the\nimpurity-spin pairs concentration.

Beyond pure\ntemporal characterization, spatio-temporal characterization provides a more\ncomplete measurement of the spatially-varying temporal properties of a laser\npulse. These so-called spatio-temporal couplings (STCs) are generally\nnonseparable chromatic aberrations that can be induced by very common optical\nelements -- for example diffraction gratings and thick lenses or prisms made\nfrom dispersive material. In this tutorial we introduce STCs and a detailed\nunderstanding of their behavior in order to have a background knowledge, but\nalso to inform the design of characterization devices. We then overview a broad\nrange of spatio-temporal characterization techniques with a view to mention\nmost techniques, but also to provide greater details on a few chosen methods.\nThe goal is to provide a reference and a comparison of various techniques for\nnewcomers to the field. Lastly, we discuss nuances of analysis and\nvisualization of spatio-temporal data, which is an often underappreciated and\nnon-trivial part of ultrafast pulse characterization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 14:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

However, soon it became clear\nthat long term predictions were extremely challenging to address. Moreover, it\nis still unclear which metric shall be used for a global description of the\nevolution of the outbreaks. Yet a robust modeling of pandemic dynamics and a\nconsistent choice of the transmission metric is crucial for an in-depth\nunderstanding of the macroscopic phenomenology and better-informed mitigation\nstrategies. In this study, we propose a Markovian stochastic framework designed\nto describe the evolution of entropy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the\ninstantaneous reproductive ratio. We then introduce and use entropy-based\nmetrics of global transmission to measure the impact and temporal evolution of\na pandemic event. In the formulation of the model, the temporal evolution of\nthe outbreak is modeled by the master equation of a nonlinear Markov process\nfor a statistically averaged individual, leading to a clear physical\ninterpretation. We also provide a full Bayesian inversion scheme for\ncalibration. The time evolution of the entropy rate, the absolute change in the\nsystem entropy, and the instantaneous reproductive ratio are natural and\ntransparent outputs of this framework. The framework has the appealing property\nof being applicable to any compartmental epidemic model. As an illustration, we\napply the proposed approach to a simple modification of the\nSusceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model. Applying the model to the\nHubei region, South Korean, Italian, Spanish, German, and French COVID-19\ndata-sets, we discover a significant difference in the absolute change of\nentropy but highly regular trends for both the entropy evolution and the\ninstantaneous reproductive ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 14:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

Attackers can project a specifically crafted\nadversarial perturbation onto a real-world object, transforming it into an AE.\nThis allows the adversary greater control over the attack compared to\nadversarial patches: (i) projections can be dynamically turned on and off or\nmodified at will, (ii) projections do not suffer from the locality constraint\nimposed by patches, making them harder to detect.\n  We study the feasibility of SLAP in the self-driving scenario, targeting both\nobject detector and traffic sign recognition tasks, focusing on the detection\nof stop signs. We conduct experiments in a variety of ambient light conditions,\nincluding outdoors, showing how in non-bright settings the proposed method\ngenerates AE that are extremely robust, causing misclassifications on\nstate-of-the-art networks with up to 99% success rate for a variety of angles\nand distances.

More\nrecently, the so-called Serverless Computing has gained traction in cloud\ncomputing, offering Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms that make use of\ncontainerization techniques to deploy services. In contrast to VM-based VNFs,\nwhere resources are usually reserved and continuously running, FaaS can just be\nsubsets of code implementing small functions allowing for event-driven,\non-demand instantiations. Thus, a hybrid VM-Container based Service Function\nChains (SFCs) are a natural evolution of NFV architecture.

In the first step, we build a generative model for a sequence of\nmedical interventions-which are discrete events in continuous time-with a\nmarked temporal point process (MTPP) where the mark is the assigned treatment\nor dosage.

A new analysis of a few carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in\nold open clusters of the Milky Way led us to identify a kink in the IFMR,\nlocated over a range of initial masses, $1.65 \\lesssim M_{\\rm i}/M_{\\odot}\n\\lesssim 2.10$. The kink's peak in WD mass of $\\approx 0.70-0.75 \\, M_{\\odot}$\nis produced by stars with $M_{\\rm i} \\simeq 1.8 - 1.9 \\, M_{\\odot}$,\ncorresponding to ages of about $1.8 - 1.7 $ Gyr. Interestingly, this peak\ncoincides with the initial mass limit between low-mass stars that develop a\ndegenerate helium core after central hydrogen exhaustion, and intermediate-mass\nstars that avoid electron degeneracy. We interpret the IFMR kink as the\nsignature of carbon star formation in the Milky Way. This finding is critical\nto constraining the evolution and chemical enrichment of low-mass stars, and\ntheir impact on the spectrophotometric properties of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 14:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

It is imperative that such studies be designed, analysed, and\nreported effectively. However, there is little available evidence on whether\nthis is the case, particularly for key statistical considerations. We therefore\ncomprehensively review such trials, examining in particular quality of\nreporting. Methods: Published oncology trials that utilised \"Simon's two-stage\ndesign\" over a 5 year period were identified and reviewed. Articles were\nevaluated on whether they reported sufficient design details, such as the\nrequired sample size, and analysis details, such as a confidence interval (CI).\nThe articles that did not adjust their inference for the incorporation of an\ninterim analysis were re-analysed to evaluate the impact on their reported\npoint estimate and CI. Results: Four hundred and twenty five articles that\nreported the results of a single treatment arm were included. Of these, 47.5%\nprovided the five components that ensure design reproducibility. Only 1.2% and\n2.1% reported an adjusted point estimate or CI, respectively. Just 55.3% of\ntrials provided the final stage rejection bound, indicating many trials did not\ntest the hypothesis the design is constructed to assess. Re-analysis of the\ntrials suggests that reported point estimates underestimated treatment effects\nand that reported CIs were too narrow. Conclusion: Key design details of\ntwo-stage single-arm trials are often unreported. Whilst inference is regularly\nperformed, it is rarely done so in a way that removes the bias introduced by\nthe interim analysis. In order to maximise their value, future studies must\nimprove the way that they are analysed and reported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 14:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

Different from previous methods\nfocusing on learning domain-invariant feature representations, some recent\nmethods present generic semi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques and directly\napply them to DA tasks, even achieving competitive performance. One of the most\npopular SSL techniques is pseudo-labeling that assigns pseudo labels for each\nunlabeled data via the classifier trained by labeled data. However, it ignores\nthe distribution shift in DA problems and is inevitably biased to source data.\nTo address this issue, we propose a new pseudo-labeling framework called\nAuxiliary Target Domain-Oriented Classifier (ATDOC). ATDOC alleviates the\nclassifier bias by introducing an auxiliary classifier for target data only, to\nimprove the quality of pseudo labels. Specifically, we employ the memory\nmechanism and develop two types of non-parametric classifiers, i.e. the nearest\ncentroid classifier and neighborhood aggregation, without introducing any\nadditional network parameters. Despite its simplicity in a pseudo\nclassification objective, ATDOC with neighborhood aggregation significantly\noutperforms domain alignment techniques and prior SSL techniques on a large\nvariety of DA benchmarks and even scare-labeled SSL tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 15:01:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 03:27:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 13:52:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 02:01:44 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 01:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

Simulations of these planets often show the potential to\nmaintain an Earth-like climate with a complete hydrological cycle. Here, we\nexamine the sensitivity of the atmospheric water cycle to changes in stellar\nflux and describe the main underlying mechanisms. In a slowly-rotating,\ntidally-locked Earth-like atmospheric model, the response to a small (about\n10%) increase in stellar irradiance from a habitable-zone control simulation is\nexamined. The water cycle is enhanced in response to the increased stellar\nirradiance. While the evaporation increase behaves similarly to the stellar\nradiation increase, the day-to-night energy transport by the mean circulation\nis critical to the planet's precipitation changes. Increased efficiency of the\nenergy transport in a warmer climate shapes the substellar precipitation\nincrease. On the nightside, precipitation changes are weak as a result of the\nlarge cancellation between the increased energy transport and the increased\nlongwave emission. The day-to-night energy transport efficiency is sensitive to\nthe variation of the atmosphere's vertical stratification. Due to weak\ntemperature gradients in upper troposphere and a moist adiabat maintained in\nthe substellar region, variations in the substellar surface temperature and\nspecific humidity govern the increase of the planet's stratification with\nwarming. This suggests a scaling of nightside's precipitation based on the\nsubstellar surface thermodynamic changes, a sensitivity that holds over a wider\nrange of stellar irradiance changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 15:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

We focus on two alternative modelling approaches: Over-Dispersion\n(OD) models, and Zero-Inflation (ZI) models, both of which can be seen as\ngeneralisations of the Poisson distribution; we refer to these as Implicit and\nExplicit ZI models, respectively. Although sometimes seen as competing\napproaches, they can be complementary; OD is a consequence of ZI modelling, and\nZI is a by-product of OD modelling. The central objective in such analyses is\noften concerned with inference on the effect of covariates on the mean, in\nlight of the apparent excess of zeros in the counts.

This in turn\nleads to a novel and technically simpler ZI model. We develop the underlying\ntheory for univariate counts and touch on its implication for multivariate\ncount data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 15:07:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 16:05:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

Most existing hate speech detection methods, although robust and\naccurate, focus on hate speech found on social media, specifically Twitter. The\ncontext of social media is much more anonymous than the workplace, therefore it\ntends to lend itself to more aggressive and \"hostile\" versions of sexism.\nTherefore, datasets with large amounts of \"hostile\" sexism have a slightly\neasier detection task since \"hostile\" sexist statements can hinge on a couple\nwords that, regardless of context, tip the model off that a statement is\nsexist.

A thermoelectric generator is a device with a finite\nextension, and its performance is measured in terms of total power output and\ntotal entropy generation.

In this framework, a\nstochastic individual-based model of cell movement and proliferation is\ncombined with a reaction-diffusion system for the concentrations of some\nmorphogens. As an illustrative example, we focus on a model in which the\ndynamics of the morphogens are governed by an activator-inhibitor system that\ngives rise to Turing pre-patterns.

In this paper, we first investigate the\nbasic characteristics of `curved' acoustic black hole in Schwarzschild\nspacetime, including the quasi-normal modes, grey-body factor and analogous\nHawking radiation. We find that the signal of quasi-normal mode is weaker than\nthat of Schwarzschild black hole. Moreover, as the tuning parameter increases,\nboth the positive real part and negative imaginal part of the quasi-normal\nfrequency approach to the horizonal axis, but they will not change sign. This\nmeans that all the perturbations could die off and the system is stable under\nthose perturbations. Since the larger tuning parameter suppresses the effective\npotential barrier, so it enhances the grey-body factor. The energy emission\nrate of Hawking radiation does not monotonically increase of the tuning\nparameter because of the non-monotonicity of the Hawking temperature. Finally,\nas a first attempt, we study the acoustic black hole shadow. The radius of\nacoustic shadow becomes larger as the tuning parameter increases, because both\nthe related acoustic horizon and the acoustic sphere become larger. Our studies\ncould help us to further understand the near horizon geometrical features of\nthe black hole.

In order to evaluate these dynamic flows from a game\ntheoretical perspective we consider the price of anarchy (PoA). In this paper\nwe study the impact of spillback effects on the PoA, which turn out to be\nsubstantial. It is known that, in general, the PoA is unbounded in the\nspillback setting. We extend this by showing that it is still unbounded even\nwhen considering networks with unit edge capacities and that the Braess ratio\ncan be arbitrarily large. In contrast to that, we show that on a fixed network\nthe PoA as a function of the flow amount is bounded by a constant and also\nupper bound the PoA for the set of networks where the outflow capacities\nsatisfy certain constraints depending on the quickest flow. This upper bound\nonly depends on the worst spillback factor of the Nash flows over time of the\ngiven network. It therefore provides a way to quantify the impact of spillback\nto the quality of the dynamic equilibria. In addition, we show the surprising\nfact that the introduction of spillback behavior can actually speed up dynamic\nequilibria in some networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 15:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

However, learning from multi-view inputs (e.g., both the\nraw signals and the time-frequency images) for sleep staging is difficult and\nnot well understood. This work proposes a sequence-to-sequence sleep staging\nmodel, XSleepNet, that is capable of learning a joint representation from both\nraw signals and time-frequency images. Since different views may generalize or\noverfit at different rates, the proposed network is trained such that the\nlearning pace on each view is adapted based on their generalization/overfitting\nbehavior. In simple terms, the learning on a particular view is speeded up when\nit is generalizing well and slowed down when it is overfitting. View-specific\ngeneralization/overfitting measures are computed on-the-fly during the training\ncourse and used to derive weights to blend the gradients from different views.\nAs a result, the network is able to retain the representation power of\ndifferent views in the joint features which represent the underlying\ndistribution better than those learned by each individual view alone.\nFurthermore, the XSleepNet architecture is principally designed to gain\nrobustness to the amount of training data and to increase the complementarity\nbetween the input views. Experimental results on five databases of different\nsizes show that XSleepNet consistently outperforms the single-view baselines\nand the multi-view baseline with a simple fusion strategy. Finally, XSleepNet\nalso outperforms prior sleep staging methods and improves previous\nstate-of-the-art results on the experimental databases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 15:22:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 15:11:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 10:15:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 21:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

Computed tomographies (CT) of the lungs are effective for assessing the\nstate of the infection. Unfortunately, labeling CT scans can take a lot of time\nand effort, with up to 150 minutes per scan. We address this challenge\nintroducing a scalable, fast, and accurate active learning system that\naccelerates the labeling of CT scan images. Conventionally, active learning\nmethods require the labelers to annotate whole images with full supervision,\nbut that can lead to wasted efforts as many of the annotations could be\nredundant. Thus, our system presents the annotator with unlabeled regions that\npromise high information content and low annotation cost. Further, the system\nallows annotators to label regions using point-level supervision, which is much\ncheaper to acquire than per-pixel annotations. Our experiments on open-source\nCOVID-19 datasets show that using an entropy-based method to rank unlabeled\nregions yields to significantly better results than random labeling of these\nregions. Also, we show that labeling small regions of images is more efficient\nthan labeling whole images.

Lymphopoiesis\ngenerates lymphocytes, the cells in charge of the adaptive immune response.\nDisruptions of this process are associated with diseases like leukaemia, which\nis especially incident in children. The characteristics of self-regulation of\nthis process make them suitable for a mathematical study.\n  In this paper we develop mathematical models of lymphopoiesis using currently\navailable data. We do this by drawing inspiration from existing structured\nmodels of cell lineage development and integrating them with paediatric bone\nmarrow data, with special focus on regulatory mechanisms. A formal analysis of\nthe models is carried out, giving steady states and their stability conditions.\nWe use this analysis to obtain biologically relevant regions of the parameter\nspace and to understand the dynamical behaviour of B-cell renovation. Finally,\nwe use numerical simulations to obtain further insight into the influence of\nproliferation and maturation rates on the reconstitution of the cells in the B\nline. We conclude that a model including feedback regulation of cell\nproliferation represents a biologically plausible depiction for B-cell\nreconstitution in bone marrow. Research into haematological disorders could\nbenefit from a precise dynamical description of B lymphopoiesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 08:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}
