The first weakness of these methods is an\nappearance domain gap problem, due to different image appearance between train\ndata from controlled environments, such as a laboratory, and test data from\nin-the-wild environments. The second weakness is that the estimation of the\npose parameters is quite challenging owing to the representation issues of 3D\nrotations. To overcome the above weaknesses, we propose Pose2Mesh, a novel\ngraph convolutional neural network (GraphCNN)-based system that estimates the\n3D coordinates of human mesh vertices directly from the 2D human pose. The 2D\nhuman pose as input provides essential human body articulation information,\nwhile having a relatively homogeneous geometric property between the two\ndomains. Also, the proposed system avoids the representation issues, while\nfully exploiting the mesh topology using a GraphCNN in a coarse-to-fine manner.\nWe show that our Pose2Mesh outperforms the previous 3D human pose and mesh\nestimation methods on various benchmark datasets.

Furthermore, a distributed computing network may\ninclude straggling nodes that run intermittently slower. This results in a\nlonger overall time needed to execute the computation tasks, thereby limiting\nthe performance of distributed computing. To address these issues, coded\ndistributed computing (CDC), i.e., a combination of coding theoretic techniques\nand distributed computing, has been recently proposed as a promising solution.\nCoding theoretic techniques have proved effective in WiFi and cellular systems\nto deal with channel noise.

These methods are optimization-based\nand thus slow, prone to local optima, and require 2D keypoints as input. We\naddress these limitations by introducing ExPose (EXpressive POse and Shape\nrEgression), which directly regresses the body, face, and hands, in SMPL-X\nformat, from an RGB image. This is a hard problem due to the high\ndimensionality of the body and the lack of expressive training data.\nAdditionally, hands and faces are much smaller than the body, occupying very\nfew image pixels.

While\nthe presence of voids in an explosive has long been known to induce so-called\nhot spots that greatly accelerate the global reaction rate, the ability to\ncomputationally resolve the details of the interaction of the shock front with\nheterogeneities existing on the scale of the detonation reaction zone has only\nrecently become feasible. In this study, the influence of the spatial\ndistribution of air-filled cavities has been examined, enabled by the use of\ngraphic processing unit (GPU) accelerated computations that can resolve shock\ninitiation and detonation propagation through an explosive while fully\nresolving features at the mesoscale. Different spatial distributions of\ncavities are examined in two-dimensional simulations, including regular arrays\nof cavities, slightly perturbed arrays, random arrays (with varying minimum\nspacing being imposed on the cavities), and randomly distributed clusters of\ncavities. The presence of the cavities is able to reduce the time required to\ninitiate detonation---for a given input shock strength---by greater than 50%,\nin agreement with previous experimental results. Randomly distributing the\ncavities results in a 15-20% decrease in detonation initiation time in\ncomparison to a regular array of cavities. Clustering the cavities---as would\noccur in the case of agglomeration---results in an additional 10% decrease in\ndetonation initiation time in comparison to random arrays. The effect of\nclustering is shown not to be a result of the clusters forming an effectively\nlarger cavity, but rather due to interactions between clusters upon shock\nloading occurring on the microscale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 16:47:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-28"}

We then project the layered features onto\nthe target views to generate the final novel-view images.

We\nstudy the consistency of global 1-form symmetries corresponding to the center\nof the gauge groups, or subgroups thereof, by activating their background\nfields, which makes the instanton density fractional. In 6d, an instanton\nbackground for a given gauge theory sources BPS strings via tadpole\ncancellation. The non-trivial 1-form symmetry background configurations\ncontribute to the charge of the BPS strings. However, Dirac quantization\nimposes restrictions on the consistent 1-form backgrounds, since they can in\ngeneral lead to and induce fractional charges, thus making (part of) the\nputative higher-form symmetry inconsistent. This gives explicit criteria to\ndetermine whether the discrete 1-form symmetries are realized. We implement\nthese criteria in concrete examples originating from string compactifications.\nWe also corroborate this by finding that a non-trivial fractional contribution\nis related to states which explicitly break the global 1-form symmetry\nappearing as massive excitations of the 6d BPS strings. For 6d theories\nconsistently coupled to gravity, this hints at a symmetry breaking tower of\nstates.

This\ncold material is associated with atomic hydrogen clouds travelling in the\nnuclear wind. The morphology and the kinematics of the molecular gas, resolved\non ~1 pc scale, indicate that these clouds are mixing with the warmer medium\nand are possibly being disrupted. The data also suggest that the mass of\nmolecular gas driven out is not negligible and could impact the rate of star\nformation in the central regions.

We find that the relative difference in the\namplitude of power spectrum between LQC and mLQC-II is approximately $50\\%$ in\nthe infrared and the oscillatory regimes, whereas this difference can be as\nlarge as $100\\%$ between mLQC-I and LQC/mLQC-II. Interestingly, in the infrared\nand the oscillatory regimes of mLQC-I, we obtain a suppressed power spectrum\nfrom the hybrid approach which is far below the Planck scale. This result is in\na striking contrast to the one obtained from dressed metric approach to\nperturbations where the corresponding amplitude in this regime is extremely\nlarge. Our analysis shows that while the phenomenological predictions are in\nagreement between two approaches for LQC and mLQC-II, for mLQC-I the\ndifferences between dressed and hybrid approaches can be quite significant. Our\nresult provides the first robust evidence of difference in predictions between\ndressed and hybrid approaches due to respective underlying constructions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 18:01:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 22:29:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

The aim is to provide the necessary basics to understand\nfirst-order phase transitions in the early universe, to outline how they leave\nimprints in gravitational waves, and advertise how those gravitational waves\ncould be detected in the future. A first-order phase transition at the\nelectroweak scale is a prediction of many theories beyond the Standard Model,\nand is also motivated as an ingredient of some theories attempting to provide\nan explanation for the matter-antimatter asymmetry in our Universe.\n  Starting from bosonic and fermionic statistics, we derive Boltzmann's\nequation and generalise to a fluid of particles with field dependent mass. We\nintroduce the thermal effective potential for the field in its lowest order\napproximation, discuss the transition to the Higgs phase in the Standard Model\nand beyond, and compute the probability for the field to cross a potential\nbarrier. After these preliminaries, we provide a hydrodynamical description of\nfirst-order phase transitions as it is appropriate for describing the early\nUniverse. We thereby discuss the key quantities characterising a phase\ntransition, and how they are imprinted in the gravitational wave power spectrum\nthat might be detectable by the space-based gravitational wave detector LISA in\nthe 2030s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 18:01:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 15:12:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 17:12:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 10:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Tracking the variation of the X-ray\nluminosity over long periods of time thus allows for investigation of the\nkinematics of the SN shock waves, the structure of the surrounding medium, and\nthe nature of the progenitor star. In this paper X-ray observations of five of\nthe oldest known X-ray supernovae - SN 1970G, SN 1968D, SN 1959D, SN 1957D and\nSN 1941C - are analyzed, with the aim of reconstructing their light curves over\nseveral decades. For those supernovae for which we can extract multi-epoch\ndata, the X-ray luminosity appears to decline with time, although with large\nerror bars. No increase in the X-ray emission from SN 1970G is found at later\nepochs, contrary to previous reports. All five SNe show X-ray luminosities that\nare of comparable magnitude. We compare the late-time X-ray luminosities of\nthese SNe to those of supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Galaxy which are a few\nhundred years old, and find that when the tentative decline is taken into\naccount, the luminosity of the old SNe studied herein could fall below the\nluminosity of some of the younger SNRs within a few hundred years. However, the\nX-ray luminosity should begin to increase as the SNe expand in the Sedov phase,\nthus reaching that of the observed SNRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 18:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

EuB6 has a very low\ncarrier density, which is known to drastically change the interaction between\nthe localized Eu moments and the conduction electrons. One of early triumphs of\nthe quantum theory in condensed matter was the presence of Fermi surface, which\nis intimately linked to the symmetry of the underlying crystal lattice.

Quantum nematic phases are analogous to\nclassical liquid crystals.

In contrast, 'nonlocal' metasurfaces function based on\nthe modes supported by many adjacent meta-units, resulting in sharp spectral\nfeatures but typically no spatial control of the outgoing wavefront. Recently,\nnonlocal metasurfaces based on quasi-bound states in the continuum have been\nshown to produce designer wavefronts only across the narrow bandwidth of the\nsupported Fano resonance.

We report the synthesis\nof a 2D insulator comprised of a single atomic sheet of honeycomb structure BeO\n(h-BeO), although its bulk counterpart has a wurtzite structure. The h-BeO is\ngrown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on Ag(111) thin films that are\nconveniently grown on Si(111) wafers.

One of these groups\ndescribes classifiers that predict using phase dependant intervals. The time\nseries forest (TSF) classifier is one of the most well known interval methods,\nand has demonstrated strong performance as well as relative speed in training\nand predictions. However, recent advances in other approaches have left TSF\nbehind. TSF originally summarises intervals using three simple summary\nstatistics. The `catch22' feature set of 22 time series features was recently\nproposed to aid time series analysis through a concise set of diverse and\ninformative descriptive characteristics. We propose combining TSF and catch22\nto form a new classifier, the Canonical Interval Forest (CIF). We outline\nadditional enhancements to the training procedure, and extend the classifier to\ninclude multivariate classification capabilities. We demonstrate a large and\nsignificant improvement in accuracy over both TSF and catch22, and show it to\nbe on par with top performers from other algorithmic classes.

Though analog computing is known to be susceptible to noise and\ndevice imperfections, various analog computing paradigms have been considered\nas promising solutions to address the growing computing demand in machine\nlearning applications, thanks to the robustness of ANNs. This robustness has\nbeen explored in low-precision, fixed-point ANN models, which have proven\nsuccessful on compressing ANN model size on digital computers. However, these\npromising results and network training algorithms cannot be easily migrated to\nanalog accelerators. The reason is that digital computers typically carry\nintermediate results with higher bit width, though the inputs and weights of\neach ANN layers are of low bit width; while the analog intermediate results\nhave low precision, analogous to digital signals with a reduced quantization\nlevel. Here we report a training method for mixed-signal ANN with two types of\nerrors in its analog signals, random noise, and deterministic errors\n(distortions). The results showed that mixed-signal ANNs trained with our\nproposed method can achieve an equivalent classification accuracy with noise\nlevel up to 50% of the ideal quantization step size.

Moreover, in many real-world\napplication scenarios like healthcare, distributed learning can also keep the\ndata local and protect privacy. A popular distributed learning strategy is\nfederated learning, where there is a central server storing the global model\nand a set of local computing nodes updating the model parameters with their\ncorresponding data. The updated model parameters will be processed and\ntransmitted to the central server, which leads to heavy communication costs.\nRecently, asynchronous decentralized distributed learning has been proposed and\ndemonstrated to be a more efficient and practical strategy where there is no\ncentral server, so that each computing node only communicates with its\nneighbors. Although no raw data will be transmitted across different local\nnodes, there is still a risk of information leak during the communication\nprocess for malicious participants to make attacks. In this paper, we present a\ndifferentially private version of asynchronous decentralized parallel SGD\n(ADPSGD) framework, or A(DP)$^2$SGD for short, which maintains communication\nefficiency of ADPSGD and prevents the inference from malicious participants.\nSpecifically, R{\\'e}nyi differential privacy is used to provide tighter privacy\nanalysis for our composite Gaussian mechanisms while the convergence rate is\nconsistent with the non-private version. Theoretical analysis shows\nA(DP)$^2$SGD also converges at the optimal $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ rate as\nSGD. Empirically, A(DP)$^2$SGD achieves comparable model accuracy as the\ndifferentially private version of Synchronous SGD (SSGD) but runs much faster\nthan SSGD in heterogeneous computing environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 00:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-24"}

We propose an experimental quantum simulation scheme to\nstudy ground state properties in two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (2D\nQED) using existing quantum technology. The proposal builds on a formulation of\nlattice gauge theories as effective spin models in arXiv:2006.14160, which\nreduces the number of qubits needed by eliminating redundant degrees of freedom\nand by using an efficient truncation scheme for the gauge fields. The latter\nendows our proposal with the perspective to take a well-controlled continuum\nlimit. Our protocols allow in principle scaling up to large lattices and offer\nthe perspective to connect the lattice simulation to low energy observable\nquantities, e.g. the hadron spectrum, in the continuum theory. By including\nboth dynamical matter and a non-minimal gauge field truncation, we provide the\nnovel opportunity to observe 2D effects on present-day quantum hardware. More\nspecifically, we present two Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) based\nprotocols for the study of magnetic field effects, and for taking an important\nfirst step towards computing the running coupling of QED. For both instances,\nwe include variational quantum circuits for qubit-based hardware, which we\nexplicitly apply to trapped ion quantum computers. We simulate the proposed VQE\nexperiments classically to calculate the required measurement budget under\nrealistic conditions. While this feasibility analysis is done for trapped ions,\nour approach can be easily adapted to other platforms.

We assume that $U$ is known in advance, and that $\\scr{C}_v$,\ntogether with the edge probabilities and weights adjacent to an online vertex\nare only revealed when the online vertex arrives. This model generalizes the\nvarious settings of the classical bipartite matching problem, and so our main\ncontribution is in making progress towards understanding which classical\nresults extend to the stochastic probing model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 01:46:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 00:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

In this way, the proposed model can learn\ninterpretable and meaningful representations for users and items. Unlike\ntraditional methods that need to make a trade-off between explainability and\neffectiveness, the performance of our proposed explainable model is not\nnegatively affected after considering explainability.

While several algorithms have\nbeen proposed for this goal, the overhead costs are often very high, which\ndegenerates the fidelity of the obtained circuits sharply.

In\nthis paper, we consider to compress RNNs based on a novel Kronecker\nCANDECOMP/PARAFAC (KCP) decomposition, which is derived from Kronecker tensor\n(KT) decomposition, by proposing two fast algorithms of multiplication between\nthe input and the tensor-decomposed weight. According to our experiments based\non UCF11, Youtube Celebrities Face and UCF50 datasets, it can be verified that\nthe proposed KCP-RNNs have comparable performance of accuracy with those in\nother tensor-decomposed formats, and even 278,219x compression ratio could be\nobtained by the low rank KCP. More importantly, KCP-RNNs are efficient in both\nspace and computation complexity compared with other tensor-decomposed ones\nunder similar ranks. Besides, we find KCP has the best potential for parallel\ncomputing to accelerate the calculations in neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 07:29:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 12:19:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

Since large-scale flows\nlike the differential rotation and the meridional circulation are driven by\nturbulent stresses in the convection zone, these flows are expected to remain\nconfined within this zone. Current observational (based on helioseismology) and\ntheoretical (based on dynamo theory) evidences point towards an equatorward\nreturn flow of the meridional circulation at the bottom of the convection zone.\nAssuming the mean values of various quantities averaged over turbulence to be\naxisymmetric, we study the large-scale flows in solar-like stars on the basis\nof a 2D mean field theory. Turbulent stresses in a rotating star can transport\nangular momentum, setting up a differential rotation. The meridional\ncirculation arises from a slight imbalance between two terms which try to drive\nit in opposite directions: a thermal wind term (arising out of the higher\nefficiency of convective heat transport in the polar regions) and a centrifugal\nterm (arising out of the differential rotation). To make these terms\ncomparable, the poles of the Sun should be slightly hotter than the equator. We\ndiscuss the important role played by the meridional circulation in the flux\ntransport dynamo model. The poloidal field generated by the Babcock--Leighton\nprocess at the surface is advected poleward, whereas the toroidal field\nproduced at the bottom of the convection zone is advected equatorward. The\nfluctuations in the meridional circulation (with coherence time of about 30--40\nyr) help in explaining many aspects of the irregularities in the solar cycle.\nFinally, we discuss how the Lorentz force of the dynamo-generated magnetic\nfield can cause periodic variations in the large-scale flows with the solar\ncycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 07:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-24"}

And then, DGL flexibly employs the Nystrom approximation error\nto measure the divergence between plastic graph and source graph to formalize\nthe distribution mismatch from the geometric perspective. Through minimizing\nthe approximation error, DGL learns a domain-invariant geometric graph to\nbridge source and target domains. Finally, we integrate the learned\ndomain-invariant graph with the semi-supervised learning and further propose an\nadaptive semi-supervised model to handle the cross-domain problems. The results\nof extensive experiments on popular datasets verify the superiority of DGL,\nespecially when only a few labeled source samples are available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 08:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-24"}

Due to the limited screen size of mobile devices, positions of\nitems have a significant influence on clicks: 1) Higher positions lead to more\nclicks for one commodity. 2) The 'pseudo-exposure' issue: Only a few\nrecommended items are shown at first glance and users need to slide the screen\nto browse other items. Therefore, some recommended items ranked behind are not\nviewed by users and it is not proper to treat this kind of items as negative\nsamples. While many works model the online recommendation as contextual bandit\nproblems, they rarely take the influence of positions into consideration and\nthus the estimation of the reward function may be biased. In this paper, we aim\nat addressing these two issues to improve the performance of online mobile\nrecommendation. Our contributions are four-fold. First, since we concern the\nreward of a set of recommended items, we model the online recommendation as a\ncontextual combinatorial bandit problem and define the reward of a recommended\nset. Second, we propose a novel contextual combinatorial bandit method called\nUBM-LinUCB to address two issues related to positions by adopting the User\nBrowsing Model (UBM), a click model for web search. Third, we provide a formal\nregret analysis and prove that our algorithm achieves sublinear regret\nindependent of the number of items. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on two\nreal-world datasets by a novel unbiased estimator. An online experiment is also\nimplemented in Taobao, one of the most popular e-commerce platforms in the\nworld. Results on two CTR metrics show that our algorithm outperforms the other\ncontextual bandit algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 08:22:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-24"}

Despite many recent efforts on GANs that\nhave been contributed, mode collapse and instability of GANs are still open\nproblems caused by their adversarial optimization difficulties. In this paper,\nmotivated by the cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm, we propose a\nCooperative Dual Evolution based Generative Adversarial Network (CDE-GAN) to\ncircumvent these drawbacks. In essence, CDE-GAN incorporates dual evolution\nwith respect to the generator(s) and discriminators into a unified evolutionary\nadversarial framework to conduct effective adversarial multi-objective\noptimization. Thus it exploits the complementary properties and injects dual\nmutation diversity into training to steadily diversify the estimated density in\ncapturing multi-modes and improve generative performance. Specifically, CDE-GAN\ndecomposes the complex adversarial optimization problem into two subproblems\n(generation and discrimination), and each subproblem is solved with a separated\nsubpopulation (E-Generator} and E-Discriminators), evolved by its own\nevolutionary algorithm. Additionally, we further propose a Soft Mechanism to\nbalance the trade-off between E-Generators and E-Discriminators to conduct\nsteady training for CDE-GAN. Extensive experiments on one synthetic dataset and\nthree real-world benchmark image datasets demonstrate that the proposed CDE-GAN\nachieves a competitive and superior performance in generating good quality and\ndiverse samples over baselines.

The\nFAM can generate high-quality anchors with an Anchor Refinement Network and\nadaptively align the convolutional features according to the anchor boxes with\na novel Alignment Convolution. The ODM first adopts active rotating filters to\nencode the orientation information and then produces orientation-sensitive and\norientation-invariant features to alleviate the inconsistency between\nclassification score and localization accuracy. Besides, we further explore the\napproach to detect objects in large-size images, which leads to a better\ntrade-off between speed and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two commonly used aerial\nobjects datasets (i.e., DOTA and HRSC2016) while keeping high efficiency.

The corresponding decision problems are\nAcyclic Colouring, Star Colouring and Injective Colouring (the last problem is\nalso known as $L(1,1)$-Labelling). A classical complexity result on Colouring\nis a well-known dichotomy for $H$-free graphs (a graph is $H$-free if it does\nnot contain $H$ as an induced subgraph). In contrast, there is no systematic\nstudy into the computational complexity of Acyclic Colouring, Star Colouring\nand Injective Colouring despite numerous algorithmic and structural results\nthat have appeared over the years.

We investigated a novel deep neural network to assess the\ngeneralizability of several large-scale cohorts.\n  Methods: A deep neural network model was developed using 15684\npolysomnography studies from five different cohorts.

The electrostatic potential of a spacecraft, VS, is important for\nthe capabilities of in situ plasma measurements.

Our goal is to investigate how the negative VS correlates with\nelectron density and temperature and to understand the physics of the observed\ncorrelation. Methods. We applied full mission comparative statistics of VS,\nelectron temperature, and electron density to establish VS dependence on cold\nand warm plasma density and electron temperature. We also used\nSpacecraft-Plasma Interaction System (SPIS) simulations and an analytical\nvacuum model to investigate if positively biased elements covering a fraction\nof the solar array surface can explain the observed correlations. Results.\nHere, the VS was found to depend more on electron density, particularly with\nregard to the cold part of the electrons, and less on electron temperature than\nwas expected for the high flux of thermal (cometary) ionospheric electrons.\nThis behaviour was reproduced by an analytical model which is consistent with\nnumerical simulations. Conclusions. Rosetta is negatively driven mainly by\npositively biased elements on the borders of the front side of the solar panels\nas these can efficiently collect cold plasma electrons.

The\nmain challenge is the lack of in-the-wild data with labeled whole-body 3D\nposes. In previous work, training data has been annotated or generated for\nsimpler tasks focusing on bodies, hands or faces separately. In this work, we\npropose to take advantage of these datasets to train independent experts for\neach part, namely a body, a hand and a face expert, and distill their knowledge\ninto a single deep network designed for whole-body 2D-3D pose detection.

The adverse impact of\nthese two factors can be mitigated by using non-coherent multi-antenna\nreceivers, which is known to require higher SINR to reach Bit-Error-Rate (BER)\nperformance of coherent receivers.

To improve the performance of VAD in such conditions, several\nmethods utilizing the visual information extracted from the region surrounding\nthe mouth/lip region of the speakers' video recording have been proposed. Even\nthough these provide advantages over audio-only methods, they depend on\nfaithful extraction of lip/mouth regions. Motivated by these, a new paradigm\nfor VAD based on the fact that respiration forms the primary source of energy\nfor speech production is proposed. Specifically, an audio-independent VAD\ntechnique using the respiration pattern extracted from the speakers' video is\ndeveloped. The Respiration Pattern is first extracted from the video focusing\non the abdominal-thoracic region of a speaker using an optical flow based\nmethod. Subsequently, voice activity is detected from the respiration pattern\nsignal using neural sequence-to-sequence prediction models. The efficacy of the\nproposed method is demonstrated through experiments on a challenging dataset\nrecorded in real acoustic environments and compared with four previous methods\nbased on audio and visual cues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 13:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-24"}

Efforts have been put into backscatter signal\ndetection as the detection performance is limited by the low\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the signal at the receiver.\nThe low SINR can be improved by adopting a multi-antenna receiver. In this\npaper, the optimum multi-antenna receiver that does not impose any constraints\non the types of binary modulation performed by the backscatter device and the\nwaveform used by the ambient source system is studied. The proposed receiver\nowns a simple structure formed by two beamformers. Bit error rate (BER)\nperformances of the optimum receiver are derived under constant-amplitude\nambient signal and Gaussian-distributed ambient signal. Moreover, to facilitate\nthe implementation of the optimum receiver, a simplified receiver is proposed\nand practical approximations to required beamformers are provided. The derived\noptimum receiver avoids the complex direct path interference cancellation and\ncoherent reception, but exploits the fact that backscatter signal changes the\ncomposite channel impinging at the receiver and the directivity of receiver\nantenna array. Comparative simulation results show that the performance of the\noptimum receiver achieves the same performance as the coherent receiver even\nthough it realizes non-coherent reception. The studied receivers provide high\nflexibility for implementing simple and low-cost receivers in different AmBC\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 14:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

However, the conventional spectral clustering\nis inherently difficult to work with large-scale networks due to the fact that\nit needs computationally expensive matrix manipulations. To deal with large\nnetworks, in this paper, we propose an efficient graph clustering algorithm,\nKCoreMotif, specifically for large networks by exploiting k-core decomposition\nand motifs. The essential idea behind the proposed clustering algorithm is to\nperform the efficient motif-based spectral clustering algorithm on k-core\nsubgraphs, rather than on the entire graph. More specifically, (1) we first\nconduct the k-core decomposition of the large input network; (2) we then\nperform the motif-based spectral clustering for the top k-core subgraphs; (3)\nwe group the remaining vertices in the rest (k-1)-core subgraphs into\npreviously found clusters; and finally obtain the desired clusters of the large\ninput network. To evaluate the performance of the proposed graph clustering\nalgorithm KCoreMotif, we use both the conventional and the motif-based spectral\nclustering algorithms as the baselines and compare our algorithm with them for\n18 groups of real-world datasets. Comparative results demonstrate that the\nproposed graph clustering algorithm is accurate yet efficient for large\nnetworks, which also means that it can be further used to evaluate the\nintra-cluster and inter-cluster trusts on large networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 12:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

However, current belief state representation becomes easily\nintractable as the number of variables and execution time grows. To address\nthis problem, we developed a novel belief state representation based on\ncartesian product and union operations over belief substates. These two\noperations and single variable assignment nodes form And-Or directed acyclic\ngraph of Belief State (AOBS). We show how to apply actions with probabilistic\noutcomes and measure the probability of conditions holding over belief state.\nWe evaluated AOBS performance in simulated forward state space exploration. We\ncompared the size of AOBS with the size of Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD) that\nwere previously used to represent belief state. We show that AOBS\nrepresentation is not only much more compact than a full belief state but it\nalso scales better than BDD for most of the cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 09:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

In this paper,\nwe establish the hybrid continuum-molecular modeling (HCMM) as a general\napproach of modeling the fluid slip flow under the influence of excess\nfluid-solid molecular interactions. This modeling approach postulates that\nfluids flow over solid surfaces with/without slip depending on the difference\nbetween the applied impulse on the fluid and a drag due to the excess\nfluid-solid molecular interactions. In the HCMM, the Navier-Stokes equations\nare corrected for the excess fluid-solid interactions. Measures of the\nfluid-solid interactions are incorporated into the fluid viscosity. We\ndemonstrate that the correction of the fluid mechanics by the slip boundary\nconditions is not an accurate approach, as the fluid-solid interactions would\nimpact the fluid internally. To show the effectiveness of the proposed HCMM, it\nis implemented for water flow in nanotubes. The HCMM is validated by an\nextensive comparison with over 90 cases of experiments and molecular dynamics\nsimulations of different fluid systems.
