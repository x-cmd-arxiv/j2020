Several previous machine\nlearning (ML)-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) have been\ndeveloped to protect against malicious online behavior. This paper proposes a\nnovel multi-stage optimized ML-based NIDS framework that reduces computational\ncomplexity while maintaining its detection performance. This work studies the\nimpact of oversampling techniques on the models' training sample size and\ndetermines the minimal suitable training sample size. Furthermore, it compares\nbetween two feature selection techniques, information gain and\ncorrelation-based, and explores their effect on detection performance and time\ncomplexity. Moreover, different ML hyper-parameter optimization techniques are\ninvestigated to enhance the NIDS's performance. The performance of the proposed\nframework is evaluated using two recent intrusion detection datasets, the\nCICIDS 2017 and the UNSW-NB 2015 datasets. Experimental results show that the\nproposed model significantly reduces the required training sample size (up to\n74%) and feature set size (up to 50%). Moreover, the model performance is\nenhanced with hyper-parameter optimization with detection accuracies over 99%\nfor both datasets, outperforming recent literature works by 1-2% higher\naccuracy and 1-2% lower false alarm rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2020 03:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

Wigner's conundrum of the friend, in\nwhich two agents ostensibly have different accounts of whether or not there is\na measurement outcome, thus poses no paradox for QBism. Indeed the resolution\nof Wigner's original thought experiment was central to the development of QBist\nthinking. The focus of this paper concerns two very instructive modifications\nto Wigner's puzzle: One, a recent no-go theorem by Frauchiger and Renner, and\nthe other a thought experiment by Baumann and Brukner. We show that the\nparadoxical features emphasized in these works disappear once both friend and\nWigner are understood as agents on an equal footing with regard to their\nindividual uses of quantum theory.

Traditionally, instruction set\narchitecture (ISA) MCMs assume that relevant program-visible memory ordering\nbehaviors only result from shared memory interactions that take place between\nuser-level program instructions. This assumption fails to account for virtual\nmemory (VM) implementations that may result in additional shared memory\ninteractions between user-level program instructions and both 1) system-level\noperations (e.g., address remappings and translation lookaside buffer\ninvalidations initiated by system calls) and 2) hardware-level operations\n(e.g., hardware page table walks and dirty bit updates) during a user-level\nprogram's execution. These additional shared memory interactions can impact the\nobservable memory ordering behaviors of user-level programs. Thus, memory\ntransistency models (MTMs) have been coined as a superset of MCMs to\nadditionally articulate VM-aware consistency rules. However, no prior work has\nenabled formal MTM specifications, nor methods to support their automated\nanalysis.\n  To fill the above gap, this paper presents the TransForm framework. First,\nTransForm features an axiomatic vocabulary for formally specifying MTMs.\nSecond, TransForm includes a synthesis engine to support the automated\ngeneration of litmus tests enhanced with MTM features (i.e., enhanced litmus\ntests, or ELTs) when supplied with a TransForm MTM specification.

Obviously, functional correctness is critical for an app's\nsuccess. However, in addition to crash bugs, non-crashing functional bugs (in\nshort as \"non-crashing bugs\" in this work) like inadvertent function failures,\nsilent user data lost and incorrect display information are prevalent, even in\npopular, well-tested apps. These non-crashing functional bugs are usually\ncaused by program logic errors and manifest themselves on the graphic user\ninterfaces (GUIs). In practice, such bugs pose significant challenges in\neffectively detecting them because (1) current practices heavily rely on\nexpensive, small-scale manual validation (the lack of automation); and (2)\nmodern fully automated testing has been limited to crash bugs (the lack of test\noracles). This paper fills this gap by introducing independent view fuzzing, a\nnovel, fully automated approach for detecting non-crashing functional bugs in\nAndroid apps. Inspired by metamorphic testing, our key insight is to leverage\nthe commonly-held independent view property of Android apps to manufacture\nproperty-preserving mutant tests from a set of seed tests that validate certain\napp properties. The mutated tests help exercise the tested apps under\nadditional, adverse conditions. Any property violations indicate likely\nfunctional bugs for further manual confirmation. We have realized our approach\nas an automated, end-to-end functional fuzzing tool, Genie. Given an app, (1)\nGenie automatically detects non-crashing bugs without requiring human-provided\ntests and oracles (thus fully automated); and (2) the detected non-crashing\nbugs are diverse (thus general and not limited to specific functional\nproperties), which set Genie apart from prior work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2020 19:34:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 05:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-06"}

Android utilizes a combination of mandatory (e.g., SEAndroid) and\ndiscretionary (e.g., UNIX permissions) access control, both to protect the\nAndroid platform from Android/OEM services and to protect Android/OEM services\nfrom third-party apps. However, OEMs often create vulnerabilities when they\nintroduce market-differentiating features because they err when re-configuring\nthis complex combination of Android policies. In this paper, we propose the\nPolyScope tool to triage the combination of Android filesystem access control\npolicies to vet releases for vulnerabilities. The PolyScope approach leverages\ntwo main insights: (1) adversaries may exploit the coarse granularity of\nmandatory policies and the flexibility of discretionary policies to increase\nthe permissions available to launch attacks, which we call permission\nexpansion, and (2) system configurations may limit the ways adversaries may use\ntheir permissions to launch attacks, motivating computation of attack\noperations.

In particular, we focus on\nthe physical and dynamical properties of those that survive in the system's\nHabitable Zone (HZ). This study is based on a comparative study between N-body\nsimulations that include fragmentation and others that consider all collisions\nas perfect mergers. We use an N-body code, presented in a previous paper, that\nallows planetary fragmentation. We carry out three sets of 24 simulations for\n400 Myr. Two sets are developed adopting a model that includes hit-and-run\ncollisions and planetary fragmentation, each one with different values of the\nindividual minimum mass allowed for the fragments. For the third set, we\nconsidered that all collisions lead to perfect mergers. The systems produced in\nN-body simulations with and without fragmentation are broadly similar, with\nsome differences. In runs with fragmentation, the formed planets have lower\nmasses since part it is distributed amongst collisional fragments.\nAdditionally, those planets presented lower eccentricities, presumably due to\ndynamical friction with the generated fragments. Perfect mergers and\nhit-and-run collisions are the most common outcome. Regardless of the\ncollisional treatment adopted, most of the planets that survive in the HZ start\nthe simulation beyond the snow line, having very high final water contents. The\nfragments' contribution to their mass and water content is negligible. Finally,\nthe individual minimum mass for fragments may play an important role in the\nplanets' collisional history. Collisional models that incorporate fragmentation\nand hit-and-run collisions lead to a more detailed description of the physical\nproperties of the terrestrial-like planets formed.

However, Deep Neural Network (DNN) vary widely in their ability to\nexploit the full power of high-performance GPUs. Spatial sharing of GPU enables\nmultiplexing several DNNs on the GPU and can improve GPU utilization, thus\nimproving throughput and lowering latency. DNN models given just the right\namount of GPU resources can still provide low inference latency, just as much\nas dedicating all of the GPU for their inference task. An approach to improve\nDNN inference is tuning of the DNN model. Autotuning frameworks find the\noptimal low-level implementation for a certain target device based on the\ntrained machine learning model, thus reducing the DNN's inference latency and\nincreasing inference throughput. We observe an interdependency between the\ntuned model and its inference latency. A DNN model tuned with specific GPU\nresources provides the best inference latency when inferred with close to the\nsame amount of GPU resources. While a model tuned with the maximum amount of\nthe GPU's resources has poorer inference latency once the GPU resources are\nlimited for inference. On the other hand, a model tuned with an appropriate\namount of GPU resources still achieves good inference latency across a wide\nrange of GPU resource availability.

These vehicles are great assets, but just as their pilot\ncan control them remotely, cyberattacks can be executed in a similar manner.\nCyber attacks on UAVs can bring a plethora of issues to physical and virtual\nsystems. Such malfunctions are capable of giving an attacker the ability to\nsteal data, incapacitate the UAV, or hijack the UAV. To mitigate such attacks,\nit is necessary to identify and patch vulnerabilities that may be maliciously\nexploited. In this paper, a new UAV vulnerability is explored with related UAV\nsecurity practices identified for possible exploitation using large streams of\ndata sent at specific ports. The more in-depth model involves strings of data\ninvolving FTP-specific keywords sent to the UAV's FTP port in the form of a\nfuzzing test and launching thousands of packets at other ports on the UAV as\nwell. During these tests, virtual and physical systems are monitored\nextensively to identify specific patterns and vulnerabilities.

During testings, the Parrot Bebop 2 is monitored for degradation\nin GPS performance, video speed, the UAV's reactivity to the pilot, motor\nfunction, and the accuracy of the UAV's sensor data. All these points of\nmonitoring give a comprehensive view of the UAV's reaction to each individual\ntest.

It has become more and more important for various\nresearch and industry areas, such as cell tracking for biomedical research and\nhuman tracking in video surveillance. Most existing algorithms depend on the\nuniqueness of the object's appearance, and the dominating bipartite matching\nscheme ignores the speed smoothness. Although several methods have incorporated\nthe velocity smoothness for tracking, they either fail to pursue global smooth\nvelocity or are often trapped in local optimums. We focus on the general MOT\nproblem regardless of the appearance and propose an appearance-free tripartite\nmatching to avoid the irregular velocity problem of the bipartite matching. The\ntripartite matching is formulated as maximizing the likelihood of the state\nvectors constituted of the position and velocity of objects, which results in a\nchain-dependent structure. We resort to the dynamic programming algorithm to\nfind such a maximum likelihood estimate. To overcome the high computational\ncost induced by the vast search space of dynamic programming when many objects\nare to be tracked, we decompose the space by the number of disappearing objects\nand propose a reduced-space approach by truncating the decomposition.

On the contrary, the\ndiseases and lesions often destroy these structures. Motivated by this, we\npropose to leverage the relation between the image texture and structure to\ndesign a deep neural network for anomaly detection. Specifically, we first\nextract the structure of the retinal images, then we combine both the structure\nfeatures and the last layer features extracted from original health image to\nreconstruct the original input healthy image. The image feature provides the\ntexture information and guarantees the uniqueness of the image recovered from\nthe structure.

However, previous methods usually learn forward or\nbackward image synthesis, but not depth estimation, as they cannot effectively\nneglect occlusions between the target and the reference images. Previous works\nrely on rigid photometric assumptions or the SIDE network to infer depth and\nocclusions, resulting in limited performance. On the other hand, we propose a\nmethod to \"Forget About the LiDAR\" (FAL), for the training of depth estimators,\nwith Mirrored Exponential Disparity (MED) probability volumes, from which we\nobtain geometrically inspired occlusion maps with our novel Mirrored Occlusion\nModule (MOM). Our MOM does not impose a burden on our FAL-net. Contrary to the\nprevious methods that learn SIDE from stereo pairs by regressing disparity in\nthe linear space, our FAL-net regresses disparity by binning it into the\nexponential space, which allows for better detection of distant and nearby\nobjects. We define a two-step training strategy for our FAL-net: It is first\ntrained for view synthesis and then fine-tuned for depth estimation with our\nMOM. Our FAL-net is remarkably light-weight and outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art methods with 8x fewer parameters and 3x faster inference\nspeeds on the challenging KITTI dataset. We present extensive experimental\nresults on the KITTI, CityScapes, and Make3D datasets to verify our method's\neffectiveness.

The notion of privacy\nused here is stronger than similar notions adopted in past work and is\nmotivated by the practical need to insure privacy regardless of the file\ndistribution. Two scenarios are considered: Single File Retrieval (SFR) and\nLinear Function Retrieval (LFR), where in the latter case each user demands an\narbitrary linear combination of the files at the server. The main contributions\nof this paper are a novel achievable scheme for LFR, referred as privacy key\nscheme, and a new information theoretic converse bound for SFR. Clearly, being\nSFR a special case of LFR, an achievable scheme for LFR works for SFR as well,\nand a converse for SFR is a valid converse for LFR as well. By comparing the\nperformance of the achievable scheme with the converse bound derived in this\npaper (for the small cache size regime) and existing converse bounds without\nprivacy constraints (in the remaining memory regime), the communication load of\nthe privacy key scheme turns out to be optimal to within a constant\nmultiplicative gap in all parameter regimes. Numerical results show that the\nnew privacy key scheme outperforms in some regime known schemes based on the\nidea of virtual users, which also satisfy the stronger notion of user privacy\nagainst colluding users adopted here. Moreover, the privacy key scheme enjoys\nmuch lower subpacketization than known schemes based on virtual users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2020 03:47:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 05:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

With an\nincreasing density of objects in Low Earth Orbit, including legacy assets used\nby the astronomy community over decades, the risk of new debris clouds forming\nis also increasing. The MWA constitutes a wide field, rapid response passive\nradar system and we explore its likely performance in the detection and\ncharacterisation of debris clouds. In general, astronomy facilities such as the\nMWA can play a role in protecting the space environment for the future. In\norder to undertake this work, we adapt the NASA EVOLVE 4.0 breakup model,\nutilising the EVOLVE outputs to produce representative dynamic debris clouds.\nWe find that the MWA is likely to detect a large fraction (>70%) of modelled\ndebris cloud fragments for collision masses between 100 kg and 1000 kg for\norbits in the lower part of LEO, if the MWA can achieve close to optimal\ndetection sensitivity. Useful detection fractions are still achieved for more\nconservative assumptions. The detection fraction of fragments decreases as a\nfunction of altitude and inversely with collision mass.

The state-of-the-art\nSNNs suffer from high inference latency, resulting from inefficient input\nencoding, and sub-optimal settings of the neuron parameters (firing threshold,\nand membrane leak). We propose DIET-SNN, a low-latency deep spiking network\nthat is trained with gradient descent to optimize the membrane leak and the\nfiring threshold along with other network parameters (weights). The membrane\nleak and threshold for each layer of the SNN are optimized with end-to-end\nbackpropagation to achieve competitive accuracy at reduced latency. The analog\npixel values of an image are directly applied to the input layer of DIET-SNN\nwithout the need to convert to spike-train. The first convolutional layer is\ntrained to convert inputs into spikes where leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneurons integrate the weighted inputs and generate an output spike when the\nmembrane potential crosses the trained firing threshold. The trained membrane\nleak controls the flow of input information and attenuates irrelevant inputs to\nincrease the activation sparsity in the convolutional and dense layers of the\nnetwork. The reduced latency combined with high activation sparsity provides\nlarge improvements in computational efficiency.

While detecting\nconcept drift is a relatively mature area of study, solutions to the\nuncertainty introduced by observations with missing values have only been\nstudied in isolation. No one has yet explored whether or how these solutions\nmight impact drift detection performance. We, however, believe that data\nimputation methods may actually increase uncertainty in the data rather than\nreducing it. We also conjecture that imputation can introduce bias into the\nprocess of estimating distribution changes during drift detection, which can\nmake it more difficult to train a learning model. Our idea is to focus on\nestimating the distance between observations rather than estimating the missing\nvalues, and to define membership functions that allocate observations to\nhistogram bins according to the estimation errors. Our solution comprises a\nnovel masked distance learning (MDL) algorithm to reduce the cumulative errors\ncaused by iteratively estimating each missing value in an observation and a\nfuzzy-weighted frequency (FWF) method for identifying discrepancies in the data\ndistribution. The concept drift detection algorithm proposed in this paper is a\nsingular and unified algorithm that can handle missing values, but not an\nimputation algorithm combined with a concept drift detection algorithm.\nExperiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the\nadvantages of this method and show its robustness in detecting drift in data\nwith missing values.

To capture the directed edges between\nnodes, existing methods mostly learn two embedding vectors for each node,\nsource vector and target vector. However, these methods learn the source and\ntarget vectors separately. For the node with very low indegree or outdegree,\nthe corresponding target vector or source vector cannot be effectively learned.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Directed Graph embedding framework based on\nGenerative Adversarial Network, called DGGAN. The main idea is to use\nadversarial mechanisms to deploy a discriminator and two generators that\njointly learn each node's source and target vectors.

However, there are more than 6,000\nlanguages in the world and most languages are lack of speech training data,\nwhich poses significant challenges when building TTS and ASR systems for\nextremely low-resource languages. In this paper, we develop LRSpeech, a TTS and\nASR system under the extremely low-resource setting, which can support rare\nlanguages with low data cost. LRSpeech consists of three key techniques: 1)\npre-training on rich-resource languages and fine-tuning on low-resource\nlanguages; 2) dual transformation between TTS and ASR to iteratively boost the\naccuracy of each other; 3) knowledge distillation to customize the TTS model on\na high-quality target-speaker voice and improve the ASR model on multiple\nvoices. We conduct experiments on an experimental language (English) and a\ntruly low-resource language (Lithuanian) to verify the effectiveness of\nLRSpeech. Experimental results show that LRSpeech 1) achieves high quality for\nTTS in terms of both intelligibility (more than 98% intelligibility rate) and\nnaturalness (above 3.5 mean opinion score (MOS)) of the synthesized speech,\nwhich satisfy the requirements for industrial deployment, 2) achieves promising\nrecognition accuracy for ASR, and 3) last but not least, uses extremely\nlow-resource training data. We also conduct comprehensive analyses on LRSpeech\nwith different amounts of data resources, and provide valuable insights and\nguidances for industrial deployment. We are currently deploying LRSpeech into a\ncommercialized cloud speech service to support TTS on more rare languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2020 08:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

A recent work of Feldman (2019) proposes a theoretical\nexplanation for this phenomenon based on a combination of two insights. First,\nnatural image and data distributions are (informally) known to be long-tailed,\nthat is have a significant fraction of rare and atypical examples. Second, in a\nsimple theoretical model such memorization is necessary for achieving\nclose-to-optimal generalization error when the data distribution is\nlong-tailed. However, no direct empirical evidence for this explanation or even\nan approach for obtaining such evidence were given.\n  In this work we design experiments to test the key ideas in this theory. The\nexperiments require estimation of the influence of each training example on the\naccuracy at each test example as well as memorization values of training\nexamples. Estimating these quantities directly is computationally prohibitive\nbut we show that closely-related subsampled influence and memorization values\ncan be estimated much more efficiently. Our experiments demonstrate the\nsignificant benefits of memorization for generalization on several standard\nbenchmarks. They also provide quantitative and visually compelling evidence for\nthe theory put forth in (Feldman, 2019).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2020 10:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

However, the temporal information hidden in the\nresponse maps is not considered in SRDCF, which limits the discriminative power\nand the robustness for accurate tracking. This work proposes a novel approach\nwith dynamic consistency pursued correlation filters, i.e., the CPCF tracker.\nSpecifically, through a correlation operation between adjacent response maps, a\npractical consistency map is generated to represent the consistency level\nacross frames.

To\nimprove the parsing performance, inspired by recent progress in dependency\nparsing, we introduce a new scoring architecture based on boundary\nrepresentation and biaffine attention, and a beneficial dropout strategy.\nExperiments on PTB, CTB5.1, and CTB7 show that our two-stage CRF parser\nachieves new state-of-the-art performance on both settings of w/o and w/ BERT,\nand can parse over 1,000 sentences per second.

Analogous to how humans solve\npuzzles (i.e., first solve the easier parts and then use the results as\nadditional information to solve difficult parts), the RFR module recurrently\ninfers the hole boundaries of the convolutional feature maps and then uses them\nas clues for further inference.

However, they suffer from a new security\nproblem, i.e., being vulnerable to physical access based attacks. An adversary\ncan easily obtain the entire neural network (NN) model by physically snooping\nthe GDDR memory bus that connects the accelerator chip with DRAM memory.\nTherefore, memory encryption becomes important for DL accelerators on edge\ndevices to improve the security of NN models. Nevertheless, we observe that\ntraditional memory encryption solutions that have been efficiently used in CPU\nsystems cause significant performance degradation when directly used in DL\naccelerators. The main reason comes from the big bandwidth gap between the GDDR\nmemory bus and the encryption engine.

Specifically, to improve the data access bandwidth, SEAL leverages\na criticality-aware smart encryption scheme which identifies partial data that\nhave no impact on the security of NN models and allows them to bypass the\nencryption engine, thus reducing the amount of data to be encrypted. To improve\nthe efficiency of memory encryption, SEAL leverages a colocation mode\nencryption scheme to eliminate memory accesses from counters used for\nencryption by co-locating data and their counters. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that, compared with traditional memory encryption solutions, SEAL\nachieves 1.4 ~ 1.6 times IPC improvement and reduces the inference latency by\n39% ~ 60%.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel recommendation method which incorporates\ninformation on common author relations between articles (i.e., two articles\nwith the same author(s)). The rationale underlying our method is that\nresearchers often search articles published by the same author(s). Since not\nall researchers have such author-based search patterns, we present two\nfeatures, which are defined based on information about pairwise articles with\ncommon author relations and frequently appeared authors, to determine target\nresearchers for recommendation. Extensive experiments we performed on a\nreal-world dataset demonstrate that the defined features are effective to\ndetermine relevant target researchers and the proposed method generates more\naccurate recommendations for relevant researchers when compared to a Baseline\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2020 03:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

A recently-developed theory --\nLocalisation Landscape Theory (LLT) -- has unparalleled strengths and\nadvantages, both computational and conceptual, over alternative methods. To\nbegin with, we demonstrate that the localisation length cannot be conveniently\ncomputed starting directly from the exact eigenstates, thus motivating the need\nfor the LLT approach. Then, we confirm that the Hamiltonian with the effective\npotential of LLT has very similar low energy eigenstates to that with the\nphysical potential, justifying the crucial role the effective potential plays\nin our new method. We proceed to use LLT to calculate the localisation length\nfor very low-energy, maximally localised eigenstates, as defined by the\nlength-scale of exponential decay of the eigenstates, (manually) testing our\nfindings against exact diagonalisation. We then describe several mechanisms by\nwhich the eigenstates spread out at higher energies where the\ntunnelling-in-the-effective-potential picture breaks down, and explicitly\ndemonstrate that our method is no longer applicable in this regime. We place\nour computational scheme in context by explaining the connection to the more\ngeneral problem of multidimensional tunnelling and discussing the\napproximations involved. Our method of calculating the localisation length can\nbe applied to (nearly) arbitrary disordered, continuous potentials at very low\nenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2020 14:30:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 04:01:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 15 May 2021 15:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

Although these face-based impressions lack\nthe evidence to determine validity, they are of vital importance, because they\nmay relate to human network-based social behavior, such as seeking certain\nindividuals for help, advice, dating, and cooperation, and thus they may relate\nto centrality in social networks. However, little to no work has investigated\nthe apparent facial traits that influence network centrality, despite the large\namount of research on attributions of the central position including\npersonality and behavior. In this paper, we examine whether perceived traits\nbased on facial appearance affect network centrality by exploring the initial\nstage of social network formation in a first-year college residential area. We\ntook face photos of participants who are freshmen living in the same\nresidential area, and we asked them to nominate community members linking to\ndifferent networks.

Our findings provide psychological evidence regarding the interaction\nbetween faces and network centrality.

While many Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis are mature and well designed for\nmonolingual text, techniques to apply these tasks to code-mixed text still\nwarrant exploration. This paper describes our feature engineering approach to\nsentiment analysis in code-mixed social media text for SemEval-2020 Task 9:\nSentiMix. We tackle this problem by leveraging a set of hand-engineered\nlexical, sentiment, and metadata features to design a classifier that can\ndisambiguate between \"positive\", \"negative\" and \"neutral\" sentiment. With this\nmodel, we are able to obtain a weighted F1 score of 0.65 for the \"Hinglish\"\ntask and 0.63 for the \"Spanglish\" tasks\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2020 00:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}
