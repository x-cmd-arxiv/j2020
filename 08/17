The uncertainty relation involves a mixture of\nthermodynamic and dynamic terms. Namely, the entropy production from\nbidirectional transitions, and the net flux of unidirectional transitions. The\nderivation does not assume a steady-state, and the results apply equally well\nto transient processes with arbitrary initial conditions. As every\nbidirectional transition can also be seen as a pair of separate unidirectional\nones, our approach is equipped with an inherent degree of freedom. Thus, for\nany given system, an ensemble of valid TURs can be derived. However, we find\nthat choosing a representation that best matches the systems dynamics over the\nobservation time will yield a TUR with a tighter bound on fluctuations. More\nprecisely, we show a bidirectional representation should be replaced by a\nunidirectional one when the entropy production associated with the transitions\nbetween two states is larger than the sum of the net fluxes between them. Thus,\nin addition to offering TURs for systems where such relations were previously\nunavailable, the results presented herein also provide a systematic method to\nimprove TUR bounds via physically motivated replacement of bidirectional\ntransitions with pairs of unidirectional transitions.

For each ISP, we\nfirst categorize online reviews into positive and negative based on customer\nratings and then leverage text analytic tools to determine the most frequently\nused and co-occurring words in each categorization of reviews.

Solving numerous Deep reinforcement learning challenges\nsuch as moving targets problem and the correlation between samples are the main\nadvantages of this model. Although there have been various extensions of DQN in\nrecent years, they all use a similar method to DQN to overcome the problem of\nmoving targets. Despite the advantages mentioned, synchronizing the network\nweight in a fixed step size, independent of the agent's behavior, may in some\ncases cause the loss of some properly learned networks.

In this method, the synchronization of weights is done\nbased on the recent behavior of the agent, which is measured by a criterion at\nthe end of the intervals.

Dose per pulse and average dose rate were measured in a\nsolid water phantom at different depths with Gafchromic film and OSLD. A pulse\ncontroller counted the pulses via scattered radiation signal and gated the\ndelivery for preset pulse count. A fast photomultiplier tube-based Cherenkov\ndetector measured per pulse beam output at 2 ns sampling rate. After conversion\nback to clinical mode, conventional beam output, flatness, symmetry, field size\nand energy were measured for all clinically commissioned energies. Results:\nDose per pulse of 0.86 +/- 0.01 Gy (310 +/- 7 Gy/s average dose rate) were\nachieved at isocenter. The dose from simultaneous irradiation of film and OSLD\nwere within 1%. The PMT showed the LINAC required about 5 pulses before the\noutput stabilized and its long-term stability was within 3% for measurements\nperformed at 3 minutes intervals. The dose, flatness, symmetry, and photon\nenergy were unchanged from baseline and within tolerance (1%, 3%, 2%, and 0.1%\nrespectively) after reverting to conventional beams. Conclusion: 10 MeV FLASH\nbeams were achieved at the isocenter of the treatment room. The beam output was\nreproducible but requires further investigation of the ramp up time in the\nfirst 5 pulses, equivalent to <100 cGy. The eFLASH beam can irradiate both\nsmall and large subjects in minimally modified clinical settings and dose rates\ncan be further increased by reducing the source to surface distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 19:33:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 16:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 04:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

However, noisy facts are unavoidably introduced into KGs that could be\ncaused by automatic extraction. To validate the correctness of facts (i.e.,\ntriplets) inside a KG, one possible approach is to map the triplets into vector\nrepresentations by capturing the semantic meanings of facts. Although many\nrepresentation learning approaches have been developed for knowledge graphs,\nthese methods are not effective for validation. They usually assume that facts\nare correct, and thus may overfit noisy facts and fail to detect such facts.\nTowards effective KG validation, we propose to leverage an external\nhuman-curated KG as auxiliary information source to help detect the errors in a\ntarget KG. The external KG is built upon human-curated knowledge repositories\nand tends to have high precision. On the other hand, although the target KG\nbuilt by information extraction from texts has low precision, it can cover new\nor domain-specific facts that are not in any human-curated repositories. To\ntackle this challenging task, we propose a cross-graph representation learning\nframework, i.e., CrossVal, which can leverage an external KG to validate the\nfacts in the target KG efficiently. This is achieved by embedding triplets\nbased on their semantic meanings, drawing cross-KG negative samples and\nestimating a confidence score for each triplet based on its degree of\ncorrectness.

Global optimization methods such as genetic\nalgorithms (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) have been combined with\nfirst principle free energy calculations to predict crystal structures given\ncomposition or only a chemical system. While these approaches can exploit\ncertain crystal patterns such as symmetry and periodicity in their search\nprocess, they usually do not exploit the large amount of implicit rules and\nconstraints of atom configurations embodied in the large number of known\ncrystal structures. They currently can only handle crystal structure prediction\nof relatively small systems. Inspired by the knowledge-rich protein structure\nprediction approach, herein we explore whether known geometric constraints such\nas the atomic contact map of a target crystal material can help predict its\nstructure given its space group information. We propose a global optimization\nbased algorithm, CMCrystal, for crystal structure reconstruction based on\natomic contact maps. Based on extensive experiments using six global\noptimization algorithms, we show that it is viable to reconstruct the crystal\nstructure given the atomic contact map for some crystal materials but more\nconstraints are needed for other target materials to achieve successful\nreconstruction.

Methods: Masks were first created\nfrom each label image through a process we termed presence masking. Three\npresence masking modes were evaluated, differing mainly in weightage assigned\nto the annotated and unannotated classes. These masks were then applied to the\nloss function during training to remove the influence of unannotated classes.\nResults: Evaluation against publicly available CT datasets shows that presence\nmasking is a viable method for training class-generic classifiers. Our\nclass-generic classifier can perform as well as multiple class-specific\nclassifiers combined, while the training duration is similar to that required\nfor one class-specific classifier.

Ensemble method is one state-of-the-art benchmark for\nprediction uncertainty estimation. However, ensembles are expensive to train\nand serve for web-scale traffic.\n  In this paper, we seek to advance the understanding of prediction variation\nestimated by the ensemble method. Through empirical experiments on two widely\nused benchmark datasets MovieLens and Criteo in recommender systems, we observe\nthat prediction variations come from various randomness sources, including\ntraining data shuffling, and parameter random initialization. By introducing\nmore randomness into model training, we notice that ensemble's mean predictions\ntend to be more accurate while the prediction variations tend to be higher.\nMoreover, we propose to infer prediction variation from neuron activation\nstrength and demonstrate the strong prediction power from activation strength\nfeatures. Our experiment results show that the average R squared on MovieLens\nis as high as 0.56 and on Criteo is 0.81. Our method performs especially well\nwhen detecting the lowest and highest variation buckets, with 0.92 AUC and 0.89\nAUC respectively. Our approach provides a simple way for prediction variation\nestimation, which opens up new opportunities for future work in many\ninteresting areas (e.g.,model-based reinforcement learning) without relying on\nserving expensive ensemble models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 00:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

Current oriented object detection methods mainly rely on\ntwo-stage anchor-based detectors. However, the anchor-based detectors typically\nsuffer from a severe imbalance issue between the positive and negative anchor\nboxes. To address this issue, in this work we extend the horizontal\nkeypoint-based object detector to the oriented object detection task. In\nparticular, we first detect the center keypoints of the objects, based on which\nwe then regress the box boundary-aware vectors (BBAVectors) to capture the\noriented bounding boxes. The box boundary-aware vectors are distributed in the\nfour quadrants of a Cartesian coordinate system for all arbitrarily oriented\nobjects. To relieve the difficulty of learning the vectors in the corner cases,\nwe further classify the oriented bounding boxes into horizontal and rotational\nbounding boxes. In the experiment, we show that learning the box boundary-aware\nvectors is superior to directly predicting the width, height, and angle of an\noriented bounding box, as adopted in the baseline method.

Quantifying human needs across the\npopulation is challenging as it requires high geo-temporal granularity, high\ncoverage across the population, and appropriate adjustment for seasonal and\nother external effects. Here, we propose a computational methodology, building\non Maslow's hierarchy of needs, that can capture a holistic view of relative\nchanges in needs following the pandemic through a difference-in-differences\napproach that corrects for seasonality and volume variations. We apply this\napproach to characterize changes in human needs across physiological,\nsocioeconomic, and psychological realms in the US, based on more than 35\nbillion search interactions spanning over 36,000 ZIP codes over a period of 14\nmonths.

The pulling force is induced by mode conversion between a pair\nof one-way-transport surface-arc waves supported on the two metamaterial\nsurfaces of the waveguide. The surface arcs bridge the momentum gaps between\nisolated bulk equifrequency surfaces (EFSs) and are topologically protected by\nthe nontrivial Chern numbers of the EFSs. When an incident surface-arc wave\nwith a relatively small wavenumber $k_{x1}$ is scattered by the particle, a\npart of its energy is transferred to the other surface-arc mode with\n$k_{x2}(>k_{x1}). Because the electromagnetic wave acquires an additional\nforward momentum from the particle proportional to $k_{x2}-k_{x1}$ during this\nprocess, the particle will always be subjected to an optical pulling force\nirrespective of its material, shape and size. Since the chiral surface-arc\nwaves are immune to backscattering from local disorders and the metamaterials\nare isotropic in the xy plane, robust optical pulling can be achieved in a\ncurved air waveguide and can go beyond standard optical pulling mechanisms\nwhich are limited to pull in a straight-line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 01:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

Such compositional tasks require\nan agent to reason about the sub-task at hand while orchestrating global\nbehavior accordingly. This can be cast as an online task inference problem,\nwhere the current task identity, represented by a context variable, is\nestimated from the agent's past experiences with probabilistic inference.\nPrevious approaches have employed simple latent distributions, e.g., Gaussian,\nto model a single context for the entire task. However, this formulation lacks\nthe expressiveness to capture the composition and transition of the sub-tasks.\nWe propose a variational inference framework OCEAN to perform online task\ninference for compositional tasks. OCEAN models global and local context\nvariables in a joint latent space, where the global variables represent a\nmixture of sub-tasks required for the task, while the local variables capture\nthe transitions between the sub-tasks. Our framework supports flexible latent\ndistributions based on prior knowledge of the task structure and can be trained\nin an unsupervised manner.

Several automatic or semi-automatic segmentation\nalgorithms have been introduced to segment brain tumors and achieve an\nexpert-like accuracy. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) have recently\nshown very promising results, however, DCNN models are still far from achieving\nclinically meaningful results mainly because of the lack of generalization of\nthe models. DCNN models need large annotated datasets to achieve good\nperformance. Models are often optimized on the domain dataset on which they\nhave been trained, and then fail the task when the same model is applied to\ndifferent datasets from different institutions. One of the reasons is due to\nthe lack of data standardization to adjust for different models and MR\nmachines. In this work, a 3D Spherical coordinates transform during the\npre-processing phase has been hypothesized to improve DCNN models' accuracy and\nto allow more generalizable results even when the model is trained on small and\nheterogeneous datasets and translated into different domains. Indeed, the\nspherical coordinate system avoids several standardization issues since it\nworks independently of resolution and imaging settings. Both Cartesian and\nspherical volumes were evaluated in two DCNN models with the same network\nstructure using the BraTS 2019 dataset.

A key feature of the proposed confidence set is\nits capability to account for the sparsity of $\\theta$, thus named as {\\em\nsparse} confidence set. This is in sharp contrast with the classical methods,\nsuch as Bonferroni confidence intervals and other resampling based procedures,\nwhere the sparsity of $\\theta$ is often ignored. Specifically, we require the\ndesired sparse confidence set to satisfy the following two conditions: (i)\nuniformly over the parameter space, the coverage probability for $\\theta$ is\nabove a pre-specified level; (ii) there exists a random subset $S$ of\n$\\{1,...,d\\}$ such that $S$ guarantees the pre-specified true negative rate\n(TNR) for detecting nonzero $\\theta_j$'s. To exploit the sparsity of $\\theta$,\nwe define that the confidence interval for $\\theta_j$ degenerates to a single\npoint 0 for any $j\\notin S$. Under this new framework, we first consider\nwhether there exist sparse confidence sets that satisfy the above two\nconditions. To address this question, we establish a non-asymptotic minimax\nlower bound for the non-coverage probability over a suitable class of sparse\nconfidence sets. The lower bound deciphers the role of sparsity and minimum\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the construction of sparse confidence sets.\nFurthermore, under suitable conditions on the SNR, a two-stage procedure is\nproposed to construct a sparse confidence set. To evaluate the optimality, the\nproposed sparse confidence set is shown to attain a minimax lower bound of some\nproperly defined risk function up to a constant factor. Finally, we develop an\nadaptive procedure to the unknown sparsity and SNR.

Specifically, every grid point in the feasible set is classified by the\npredicted label indicating the local energy minimum that the grid point\nconverges to. The classifier is created and updated at every iteration using\nthe already-known information on the local optimizations at the earlier\niterations, which is based on the support vector machine (SVM). The SVM\nclassifier uses our original kernel function designed as reflecting the\nsymmetries of both host crystal and interstitial species. The most distant\nunobserved point on the classification boundaries from the observed points is\nsampled as the next initial point for local optimization. The proposed method\nis applied to three model cases, i.e., the six-hump camelback function, a\nproton in strontium zirconate with the orthorhombic perovskite structure, and a\nwater molecule in lanthanum sulfate with the monoclinic structure, to\ndemonstrate the high performance of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 07:06:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 03:11:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 09:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

Low-Cost MCU-based end-nodes have limited\non-chip memory and often replace caches with scratchpads, to reduce area\noverheads and increase energy efficiency -- requiring explicit DMA-based memory\ntransfers between different levels of the memory hierarchy. Mapping modern DNNs\non these systems requires aggressive topology-dependent tiling and\ndouble-buffering. In this work, we propose DORY (Deployment Oriented to memoRY)\n- an automatic tool to deploy DNNs on low cost MCUs with typically less than\n1MB of on-chip SRAM memory. DORY abstracts tiling as a Constraint Programming\n(CP) problem: it maximizes L1 memory utilization under the topological\nconstraints imposed by each DNN layer. Then, it generates ANSI C code to\norchestrate off- and on-chip transfers and computation phases. Furthermore, to\nmaximize speed, DORY augments the CP formulation with heuristics promoting\nperformance-effective tile sizes. As a case study for DORY, we target\nGreenWaves Technologies GAP8, one of the most advanced parallel ultra-low power\nMCU-class devices on the market. On this device, DORY achieves up to 2.5x\nbetter MAC/cycle than the GreenWaves proprietary software solution and 18.1x\nbetter than the state-of-the-art result on an STM32-F746 MCU on single layers.\nUsing our tool, GAP-8 can perform end-to-end inference of a 1.0-MobileNet-128\nnetwork consuming just 63 pJ/MAC on average @ 4.3 fps - 15.4x better than an\nSTM32-F746.

The presence of a feedback means that the external\naffect on the system depends on its current state.

To segment multiple organs of interest, it is generally quite\ndifficult to collect full annotations of all the organs on the same images, as\nsome medical centers might only annotate a portion of the organs due to their\nown clinical practice. In most scenarios, one might obtain annotations of a\nsingle or a few organs from one training set, and obtain annotations of the the\nother organs from another set of training images. Existing approaches mostly\ntrain and deploy a single model for each subset of organs, which are memory\nintensive and also time inefficient. In this paper, we propose to co-train\nweight-averaged models for learning a unified multi-organ segmentation network\nfrom few-organ datasets. We collaboratively train two networks and let the\ncoupled networks teach each other on un-annotated organs. To alleviate the\nnoisy teaching supervisions between the networks, the weighted-averaged models\nare adopted to produce more reliable soft labels. In addition, a novel region\nmask is utilized to selectively apply the consistent constraint on the\nun-annotated organ regions that require collaborative teaching, which further\nboosts the performance.

In recent\nliterature on this topic, neural networks are introduced to make game engine\ndifferentiable and the self-supervised learning is used to predict facial\ncustomization parameters. However, in previous methods, the expression\nparameters and facial identity parameters are highly coupled with each other,\nmaking it difficult to model the intrinsic facial features of the character.\nBesides, the neural network based renderer used in previous methods is also\ndifficult to be extended to multi-view rendering cases. In this paper,\nconsidering the above problems, we propose a novel method named \"PokerFace-GAN\"\nfor neutral face game character auto-creation. We first build a differentiable\ncharacter renderer which is more flexible than the previous methods in\nmulti-view rendering cases. We then take advantage of the adversarial training\nto effectively disentangle the expression parameters from the identity\nparameters and thus generate player-preferred neutral face (expression-less)\ncharacters. Since all components of our method are differentiable, our method\ncan be easily trained under a multi-task self-supervised learning paradigm.\nExperiment results show that our method can generate vivid neutral face game\ncharacters that are highly similar to the input photos. The effectiveness of\nour method is verified by comparison results and ablation studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 08:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

The wave\nfunction is composed of $M$ layers of two elementary sets of time-evolution\noperators, each set being decomposed into commutable local operators. The\nevolution time of each time-evolution operator is treated as a variational\nparameter so as to minimize the expectation value of the energy. We show that\nthe exact ground state is reached by applying the layers of time-evolution\noperators as many as a quarter of the system size. This is the minimum number\n$M_B$ of layers set by the limit of speed, i.e., the Lieb-Robinson bound, for\npropagating quantum entanglement via the local time-evolution operators.\nQuantities such as the energy $E$ and the entanglement entropy $S$ of the\noptimized variational wave function with $M < M_B$ are independent of the\nsystem size $L$ but fall into some universal functions of $M$. The development\nof the entanglement in these ansatz is further manifested in the progressive\npropagation of single-particle orbitals in the variational wave function. We\nalso find that the optimized variational parameters show a systematic structure\nthat provides the optimum scheduling function in the quantum adiabatic process.\nWe also investigate the imaginary-time evolution of this variational wave\nfunction, where the causality relation is absent due to the non-unitarity of\nthe imaginary-time evolution operators, thus the norm of the wave function\nbeing no longer conserved.

Collaborative recommender methods usually represent an\nitem as one single latent vector. Nowadays the e-commercial platforms provide\nvarious kinds of attribute information for items (e.g., category, price and\nstyle of clothing). Utilizing these attribute information for better item\nrepresentations is popular in recent years. Some studies use the given\nattribute information as side information, which is concatenated with the item\nlatent vector to augment representations. However, the mixed item\nrepresentations fail to fully exploit the rich attribute information or provide\nexplanation in recommender systems. To this end, we propose a fine-grained\nDisentangled Item Representation (DIR) for recommender systems in this paper,\nwhere the items are represented as several separated attribute vectors instead\nof a single latent vector. In this way, the items are represented at the\nattribute level, which can provide fine-grained information of items in\nrecommendation. We introduce a learning strategy, LearnDIR, which can allocate\nthe corresponding attribute vectors to items.

To better utilize the\nvisual information, the posteriors of the latent variables are inferred from\nmixed speech (instead of clean speech) as well as the visual data.

All the latent\nvariables and noise parameters are then estimated by a Monte Carlo\nexpectation-maximization algorithm.

A novel outlier\nrejection criterion is proposed in the plane-feature tracking for high-quality\ndata association. Only the tracked planar points belonging to the same plane\nwill be used for plane initialization, which makes the plane extraction\nefficient and robust. Moreover, we perform the observability analysis for the\nLiDAR-IMU subsystem and report the degenerate cases for spatiotemporal\ncalibration using plane features.

Thus, letting\n$N^{(n)}_l=\\sum_{k=1}^{n-l+1}1_{A^{(n)}_{l;k}}$ denote the number of sets of\n$l$ consecutive numbers appearing in sets of consecutive positions, we have\n\\begin{equation*} \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} E_n^{q_n}N^{(n)}_l = \\begin{cases}\\infty,\\\n\\text{if}\\ l<\\frac{1+\\alpha}\\alpha;\\\\ 0,\\ \\text{if} \\ l>\\frac{1+\\alpha}\\alpha.\n\\end{cases}. \\end{equation*} We also consider the cases $\\alpha=1$ and\n$\\alpha>1$. In the other part of the paper we consider general $p$-shifted\ndistributions, of which the Mallows distribution is a particular case. We\ncalculate explicitly the quantity $\\lim_{l\\to\\infty}\n\\liminf_{n\\to\\infty}P_n^q(A^{(n)}_{l;k_n}) =\n\\lim_{l\\to\\infty}\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}P_n^q(A^{(n)}_{l;k_n})$ in terms of the\n$p$-distribution.

The equivalent width and velocity separation of the emission\npeaks indicate variations of the outer disk radius by a factor ~ 2.2, although\nthe variability appears more complex than expected from first principle\nrelations for optically thin Keplerian disks. We observe a time delay between\nthe variations of the strengths of He I 5876 on the one hand and H-alpha and\nH-beta on the other hand. We interpret this behaviour in a two-step disk growth\nscenario, where the disk first expands radially before its density increases. A\ndifference in behaviour is also seen between H-alpha and the H I Paschen lines,\nwith the latter displaying a more symmetric cycle, similar to the photometric\nvariability. The rather fast decays of the H-alpha emission observed in 2001,\n2009 and 2018 - 2019 suggest that the strong radiation field and early spectral\ntype of the star lead to a faster dissipation of the disk than in later-type Be\nstars, as theoretically expected.

Until the 1980s X-ray transmission was used in case of\nspecial demands and showed a resolution much higher than other NDT techniques.\nHowever, due to safety concerns and cost issues, this method is almost never\nused anymore. Muon tomography has received much attention recently. Novel\ndetectors for cosmic muons and tomographic imaging algorithms have opened up\nnew fields of application, such as the investigation of freight containers for\ncontraband or the assessment of the contents of radioactive waste containers.\nBut Muon imaging also has the potential to fill some of the gaps currently\nexisting in concrete NDT. As a first step towards practical use and as a proof\nof concept we used an existing system to image the interior of a reference\nreinforced 600 kg concrete block. Even with a yet not optimized setup for this\nkind of investigation, the muon imaging results show more resolution and less\ndistortion compared to ultrasonic and radar imaging. The data acquisition takes\nmore time and signals contain more noise, but the images allowed to detect the\nsame important features that are visible in conventional high energy x-ray\ntomography. In our experiment, we have shown the tremendous potential of muon\nimaging for concrete inspection. The next steps include the development of\nmobile detectors and optimising acquisition and imaging parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 12:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

Self-generated, microturbulence is too weak\nin relativistic magnetized shocks to accelerate particles over a wide energy\nrange, suggesting that the global dynamics of the nebula may be involved in the\nacceleration process instead. In this work, we study the role played by the\nlarge-scale anisotropy of the transverse magnetic field profile on the shock\ndynamics. We performed large two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations for a\nwide range of upstream plasma magnetizations. A large-scale velocity shear and\ncurrent sheets form in the equatorial regions and at the poles, where they\ndrive strong plasma turbulence via Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices and kinks. The\nmixing of current sheets in the downstream flow leads to efficient nonthermal\nparticle acceleration. The power-law spectrum hardens with increasing\nmagnetization, akin to those found in relativistic reconnection and kinetic\nturbulence studies. The high end of the spectrum is composed of particles\nsurfing on the wake produced by elongated spearhead-shaped cavities forming at\nthe shock front and piercing through the upstream flow. These particles are\nefficiently accelerated via the shear-flow acceleration mechanism near the Bohm\nlimit. Magnetized relativistic shocks are very efficient particle accelerators.\nCapturing the global dynamics of the downstream flow is crucial to\nunderstanding them, and therefore local plane parallel studies may not be\nappropriate for pulsar wind nebulae and possibly other astrophysical\nrelativistic magnetized shocks. A natural outcome of such shocks is a variable\nand Doppler-boosted synchrotron emission at the high end of the spectrum\noriginating from the shock-front cavities, reminiscent of the mysterious Crab\nNebula gamma-ray flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 12:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

As\nmore and more internet applications migrate to the cloud, the resource\nefficiency and the survivability of VNs, such as single link failure or\nlarge-scale disaster survivability, have become crucial issues. Separating the\nVNE problem into node and link mapping sub-problems without coordination might\ncause a high embedding cost. This dissertation presents two independent\napproaches to solve the aforementioned challenges. First, we study two-stage\ncoordinated survivable VNE (SVNE) problem and propose an adaptive path\nsplitting based SVNE (APSS) scheme. We first develop a concise anchor node\nstrategy to restrict the solution space of the candidate substrate nodes, which\ncoordinates node mapping with link mapping to limit the distance spans of the\nvirtual links. Then, we employ an adaptive path splitting policy to provide\nfull protection against single-link failures with partial backup resource, and\ndesign an agile frequency slot windows choosing mechanism to mitigate the\nspectrum fragmentation for link resource efficiency. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed APSS scheme can achieve satisfactory performance\nin terms of spectrum utilization and blocking ratio. Second, we propose a\nsynchronous evacuation strategy for VNs with dual virtual machines (VMs) inside\na disaster risk zone (DRZ), which suffer higher risks than the VNs with single.\nThe evacuation strategy exploits post-copy technique to sustain the online\nservice alive and enhances synchronous VM migrations to shorten the dual-VM\nevacuation time. Numerical results show that the proposed strategy can\noutperform the best-effort scheme in terms of average and total evacuation\ntimes of dual-VMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 12:37:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

In the previous studies on automatic arrhythmia detection, most\nmethods concatenated 12 leads of ECG into a matrix, and then input the matrix\nto a variety of feature extractors or deep neural networks for extracting\nuseful information. Under such frameworks, these methods had the ability to\nextract comprehensive features (known as integrity) of 12-lead ECG since the\ninformation of each lead interacts with each other during training. However,\nthe diverse lead-specific features (known as diversity) among 12 leads were\nneglected, causing inadequate information learning for 12-lead ECG.

By avoiding the need\nto transport the training data to the central server, federated learning\nimproves privacy and efficiency. But it raises the risk of model theft by\nclients because the resulting model is available on every client device. Even\nif the application software used for local training may attempt to prevent\ndirect access to the model, a malicious client may bypass any such restrictions\nby reverse engineering the application software. Watermarking is a well-known\ndeterrence method against model theft by providing the means for model owners\nto demonstrate ownership of their models. Several recent deep neural network\n(DNN) watermarking techniques use backdooring: training the models with\nadditional mislabeled data. Backdooring requires full access to the training\ndata and control of the training process. This is feasible when a single party\ntrains the model in a centralized manner, but not in a federated learning\nsetting where the training process and training data are distributed among\nseveral client devices. In this paper, we present WAFFLE, the first approach to\nwatermark DNN models trained using federated learning. It introduces a\nretraining step at the server after each aggregation of local models into the\nglobal model. We show that WAFFLE efficiently embeds a resilient watermark into\nmodels incurring only negligible degradation in test accuracy (-0.17%), and\ndoes not require access to training data. We also introduce a novel technique\nto generate the backdoor used as a watermark. It outperforms prior techniques,\nimposing no communication, and low computational (+3.2%) overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 13:27:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 13:33:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 10:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

Traditional image denoising\nmethods can not remove Cryo-EM image noise well when the signal-noise-ratio\n(SNR) of images is meager.

However,\nkriging and its variants (such as regression kriging, in which auxiliary\nvariables or derivatives of these are included as covariates) are relatively\nrestrictive models and lack capabilities that have been afforded to us in the\nlast decade by deep neural networks. Principal among these is feature learning\n- the ability to learn filters to recognise task-specific patterns in gridded\ndata such as images. Here we demonstrate the power of feature learning in a\ngeostatistical context, by showing how deep neural networks can automatically\nlearn the complex relationships between point-sampled target variables and\ngridded auxiliary variables (such as those provided by remote sensing), and in\ndoing so produce detailed maps of chosen target variables. At the same time, in\norder to cater for the needs of decision makers who require well-calibrated\nprobabilities, we obtain uncertainty estimates via a Bayesian approximation\nknown as Monte Carlo dropout. In our example, we produce a national-scale\nprobabilistic geochemical map from point-sampled assay data, with auxiliary\ninformation provided by a terrain elevation grid. Unlike traditional\ngeostatistical approaches, auxiliary variable grids are fed into our deep\nneural network raw. There is no need to provide terrain derivatives (e.g. slope\nangles, roughness, etc) because the deep neural network is capable of learning\nthese and arbitrarily more complex derivatives as necessary to maximise\npredictive performance.

This conjecture was couched in a broader setting by\nAharoni and Zerbib who proposed a hypergraph version of this conjecture, and\nalso studied its implied fractional versions. We establish the fractional\nversion of the Aharoni-Zerbib conjecture up to lower order terms. Specifically,\nwe give a factor $t/2+ O(\\sqrt{t \\log t})$ approximation based on LP rounding\nfor an algorithmic version of the hypergraph Tur\\'{a}n problem (AHTP). The\nobjective in AHTP is to pick the smallest collection of $(t-1)$-sized subsets\nof vertices of an input $t$-uniform hypergraph such that every hyperedge\ncontains one of these subsets.\n  Aharoni and Zerbib also posed whether Tuza's conjecture and its hypergraph\nversions could follow from non-trivial duality gaps between vertex covers and\nmatchings on hypergraphs that exclude certain sub-hypergraphs, for instance, a\n\"tent\" structure that cannot occur in the incidence of triangles and edges. We\ngive a strong negative answer to this question, by exhibiting tent-free\nhypergraphs, and indeed $\\mathcal{F}$-free hypergraphs for any finite family\n$\\mathcal{F}$ of excluded sub-hypergraphs, whose vertex covers must include\nalmost all the vertices.\n  The algorithmic questions arising in the above study can be phrased as\ninstances of vertex cover on simple hypergraphs, whose hyperedges can pairwise\nshare at most one vertex. We prove that the trivial factor $t$ approximation\nfor vertex cover is hard to improve for simple $t$-uniform hypergraphs.\nHowever, for set cover on simple $n$-vertex hypergraphs, the greedy algorithm\nachieves a factor $(\\ln n)/2$, better than the optimal $\\ln n$ factor for\ngeneral hypergraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 14:12:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 03:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

For the decoder stage, we\npropose regional convolutions, a novel operator aimed at maximizing the global\nactivation entropy. Furthermore, inspired by the local refining procedure in\nPoint Completion Network (PCN), we also propose a patch-deforming operation to\nsimulate deconvolutional operations for point clouds. This paper proves that\nour regional activation can be incorporated in many point cloud architectures\nlike AtlasNet and PCN, leading to better performance for geometric completion.\nWe evaluate our approach on different 3D tasks such as object completion and\nclassification, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 14:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

This is more direct numerical approach to study the\ndevelopment of spin-induced scalarization and it can serve as an independent\ncheck of the previous results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 15:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

We\nconstruct a robotic arm by assembling Kresling origami modules that exhibit\npredictable bistability. Via switching between their two stable states, these\norigami modules can behave either like a flexible joint with low bending\nstiffness or like a stiff link with high stiffness, without requiring any\ncontinuous power supply. In this way, the robotic arm can exhibit\npseudo-linkage kinematics with lower control requirements and improved motion\naccuracy. A unique advantage of using origami as the robotic arm skeleton is\nthat its bending stiffness ratio between stable states is directly related to\nthe underlying Kresling design. Therefore, we conduct extensive parametric\nanalyses and experimental validations to identify the optimized Kresling\npattern for articulation. The results indicate that a higher angle ratio, a\nsmaller resting length at contracted stable state, and a large number of\npolygon sides can offer more significant and robust bending stiffness tuning.\nBased on this insight, we construct a proof-of-concept, tendon-driven robotic\narm consisting of three modules, and show that it can exhibit the desired\nreconfigurable articulation behavior.

This type of question is by now very\nwell-studied, but, somewhat strikingly, the algorithmic frontier between the\ntwo (arguably) most central width notions, treewidth and pathwidth, is still\nnot understood: currently, no natural graph problem is known to be W-hard for\none but FPT for the other.

It would thus appear\nthat the extra generality of treewidth over pathwidth often comes \"for free\".\n  Our main contribution in this paper is to uncover the first natural example\nwhere this generality comes with a high price.

To address these aspects, we propose a nonlinear structure-preserving\nmodel reduction where the reduced phase space evolves in time. In the spirit of\ndynamical low-rank approximation, the reduced dynamics is obtained by a\nsymplectic projection of the Hamiltonian vector field onto the tangent space of\nthe approximation manifold at each reduced state.

The\nlessons from this experience are widely applicable, shareable both as\nsupporting service to other regions and through knowledge transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 14:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-21"}

The COVID-19 vaccine development is underway and it\nmay take a significant amount of time to develop the vaccine and after\ndevelopment, it will take time to vaccinate the entire population, and plasma\ntherapy has some limitations. Herd immunity can be a plausible option to fight\nCOVID-19 for small countries. But for a country with huge population like\nIndia, herd immunity is not a plausible option, because to acquire herd\nimmunity approximately 67% of the population has to be recovered from COVID-19\ninfection, which will put an extra burden on medical system of the country and\nwill result in a huge loss of human life. Thus epidemiological interventions\n(complete lockdown, partial lockdown, quarantine, isolation, social distancing,\netc.) are some suitable strategies in India to slow down the COVID-19 spread\nuntil the vaccine development. In this work, we have suggested the SIR model\nwith intervention, which incorporates the epidemiological interventions in the\nclassical SIR model. To model the effect of the interventions, we have\nintroduced \\r{ho} as the intervention parameter. \\r{ho} is a cumulative\nquantity which covers all type of intervention. We have also discussed the\nsupervised machine learning approach to estimate the transmission rate\n(\\b{eta}) for the SIR model with intervention from the prevalence of COVID-19\ndata in India and some states of India.

More specifically, the reformulation of the elastodynamic problem via\nvariable and fractional order operators enables a unique and extremely powerful\napproach to model nucleation and propagation of cracks in solids under dynamic\nloading. The resulting dynamic fracture formulation is fully evolutionary hence\nenabling the analysis of complex crack patterns without requiring any a prior\nassumptions on the damage location and the growth path, as well as the use of\nany algorithm to track the evolving crack surface. The evolutionary nature of\nthe variable-order formalism also prevents the need for additional partial\ndifferential equations to predict the damage field, hence suggesting a\nconspicuous reduction in the computational cost. Remarkably, the variable order\nformulation is naturally capable of capturing extremely detailed features\ncharacteristic of dynamic crack propagation such as crack surface roughening,\nsingle and multiple branching. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed\nvariable-order formulation is validated by comparing the results of direct\nnumerical simulations with experimental data of typical benchmark problems\navailable in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 23:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}
