The\nnovelty and strength of our method lies in its capability to recommend similar\narticles for all the fashion items worn by the model, in addition to the\nprimary article corresponding to the query. This is not only important to\npromote cross-sells for boosting revenue, but also for improving customer\nexperience and engagement. In addition, our approach is also capable of\nrecommending similar products for User Generated Content (UGC), eg., fashion\narticle images uploaded by users.

However,\ndespite the high speed and energy efficiency of neuromorphic computing,\nalgorithms utilizing this hardware in control scenarios are still rare. One\nproblem is the transition from fast spiking activity on the hardware, which\nacts on a timescale of a few milliseconds, to a control-relevant timescale on\nthe order of hundreds of milliseconds. Another problem is the execution of\ncomplex trajectories, which requires spiking activity to contain sufficient\nvariability, while at the same time, for reliable performance, network dynamics\nmust be adequately robust against noise. In this study we exploit a recently\ndeveloped biologically-inspired spiking neural network model, the so-called\nanisotropic network. We identified and transferred the core principles of the\nanisotropic network to neuromorphic hardware using Intel's neuromorphic\nresearch chip Loihi and validated the system on trajectories from a\nmotor-control task performed by a robot arm. We developed a network\narchitecture including the anisotropic network and a pooling layer which allows\nfast spike read-out from the chip and performs an inherent regularization. With\nthis, we show that the anisotropic network on Loihi reliably encodes sequential\npatterns of neural activity, each representing a robotic action, and that the\npatterns allow the generation of multidimensional trajectories on\ncontrol-relevant timescales.

The application domain we have in mind is inferring\nslow changes in variables (e.g., extracellular ion concentrations or synaptic\nefficacy) that underlie phase transitions in brain activity (e.g., paroxysmal\nseizure activity). The scheme is efficient and yet retains a biophysical\ninterpretation, in virtue of being based on established neural mass models that\nare equipped with a slow dynamic on the parameters (such as synaptic rate\nconstants or effective connectivity). In brief, we use an adiabatic\napproximation to summarise fast fluctuations in hidden neuronal states (and\ntheir expression in sensors) in terms of their second order statistics; namely,\ntheir complex cross spectra. This allows one to specify and compare models of\nslowly changing parameters (using Bayesian model reduction) that generate a\nsequence of empirical cross spectra of electrophysiological recordings.\nCrucially, we use the slow fluctuations in the spectral power of neuronal\nactivity as empirical priors on changes in synaptic parameters. This introduces\na circular causality, in which synaptic parameters underwrite fast neuronal\nactivity that, in turn, induces activity-dependent plasticity in synaptic\nparameters.

However, customers usually prefer to buy apparel based on\ntheir style information, or simply put, occasion (eg, party/ sports/ casual\nwear). Application of a supervised image-captioning model to generate\nstyle-based image captions is limited because obtaining ground-truth\nannotations in the form of style-based captions is difficult. This is because\nannotating style-based captions requires a certain amount of fashion domain\nexpertise, and also adds to the costs and manual effort. On the contrary,\nlow-level attribute based annotations are much more easily available. To\naddress this issue, we propose a transfer-learning based image captioning model\nthat is trained on a source dataset with sufficient attribute-based\nground-truth captions, and used to predict style-based captions on a target\ndataset. The target dataset has only a limited amount of images with\nstyle-based ground-truth captions. The main motivation of our approach comes\nfrom the fact that most often there are correlations among the low-level\nattributes and the higher-level styles for an apparel. We leverage this fact\nand train our model in an encoder-decoder based framework using attention\nmechanism. In particular, the encoder of the model is first trained on the\nsource dataset to obtain latent representations capturing the low-level\nattributes. The trained model is fine-tuned to generate style-based captions\nfor the target dataset. To highlight the effectiveness of our method, we\nqualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that the captions generated by our\napproach are close to the actual style information for the evaluated apparel.

It is not clear to what extent these matrix\nelements need to be tuned in order to generate long time scales; in some cases,\none needs not just a single long time scale but a whole range. Starting from\nthe simplest case of random symmetric connections, we combine maximum entropy\nand random matrix theory methods to construct ensembles of networks, exploring\nthe constraints required for long time scales to become generic. We argue that\na single long time scale can emerge generically from realistic constraints, but\na full spectrum of slow modes requires more tuning. Langevin dynamics that will\ngenerate patterns of synaptic connections drawn from these ensembles involve a\ncombination of Hebbian learning and activity-dependent synaptic scaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 16:57:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-27"}

The good agreement between the experimental and\ncalculated $S$ suggests the band gap could be $\\sim$0.7 eV. This is supported\nby the obtained mBJ band gap of $\\sim$0.7 eV.

The effect\nof long range Coulomb interactions on phonon frequencies are also included by\nnon-analytical term correction. Under quasi-harmonic approximation, the thermal\nexpansion behaviour upto 1200 K is calculated. Using the first-principles\nanharmonic phonon calculations, the lattice thermal conductivity $\\kappa_{ph}$\nof FeVSb is obtained under single-mode relaxation time approximation\nconsidering the phonon-phonon interaction. At 300 K, the calculated\n$\\kappa_{ph}$ is $\\sim$18.6 W$m^{-1}K^{-1}$ which is higher compared to\nexperimental value. But, above 500 K the calculated $\\kappa_{ph}$ is in good\nagreement with experiment. A prediction of figure of merit $ZT$ and efficiency\nfor p-type and n-type FeVSb is made by finding out optimal carrier\nconcentration.

Existing studies in this track mainly focus on\nintra-image invariance learning. The learning typically uses rich intra-image\ntransformations to construct positive pairs and then maximizes agreement using\na contrastive loss. The merits of inter-image invariance, conversely, remain\nmuch less explored. One major obstacle to exploit inter-image invariance is\nthat it is unclear how to reliably construct inter-image positive pairs, and\nfurther derive effective supervision from them since no pair annotations are\navailable. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study to better\nunderstand the role of inter-image invariance learning from three main\nconstituting components: pseudo-label maintenance, sampling strategy, and\ndecision boundary design. To facilitate the study, we introduce a unified and\ngeneric framework that supports the integration of unsupervised intra- and\ninter-image invariance learning. Through carefully-designed comparisons and\nanalysis, multiple valuable observations are revealed: 1) online labels\nconverge faster and perform better than offline labels; 2) semi-hard negative\nsamples are more reliable and unbiased than hard negative samples; 3) a less\nstringent decision boundary is more favorable for inter-image invariance\nlearning. With all the obtained recipes, our final model, namely InterCLR,\nshows consistent improvements over state-of-the-art intra-image invariance\nlearning methods on multiple standard benchmarks.

We start by studying the evolution of this gas before its\nbound part returns to the original stellar pericenter. While the axial motion\nis entirely ballistic, the transverse directions of the stream are usually\nthinner due to the confining effects of self-gravity. This basic picture may\nalso be influenced by additional physical effects such as clump formation,\nhydrogen recombination, magnetic fields and the interaction with the ambient\nmedium. We then examine the fate of this stream when it comes back to the\nvicinity of the black hole to form an accretion flow. Despite recent progress,\nthe hydrodynamics of this phase remains uncertain due to computational\nlimitations that have so far prevented us from performing a fully\nself-consistent simulation. Most of the initial energy dissipation appears to\nbe provided by a self-crossing shock that results from an intersection of the\nstream with itself. The debris evolution during this collision depends on\nrelativistic apsidal precession, expansion of the stream from pericenter, and\nnodal precession induced by the black hole spin. Although the combined\ninfluence of these effects is not fully understood, current works suggest that\nthis interaction is typically too weak to significantly circularize the\ntrajectories, with its main consequence being an expansion of the shocked gas.\nGlobal simulations of disc formation using simplified initial conditions find\nthat the debris experiences additional collisions that cause its orbits to\nbecome more circular until eventually settling into a thick structure. These\nworks suggest that this process completes faster for more relativistic\nencounters due to stronger shocks. However, important aspects still remain to\nbe understood at the time of writing, due to numerical challenges and the\ncomplexity of this process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 17:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

We do it through an analysis of simple\nproperties (additivity and Haag duality) of the net of operator algebras\nattached to space-time regions. We observe that different types of symmetries\nare associated with the breaking of these properties in regions of different\nnon-trivial topologies. When such topologies are connected, we show that the\nnon locally generated operators generate an Abelian symmetry group, and their\ncommutation relations are fixed. The existence of order parameters with area\nlaw, like the Wilson loop for the confinement phase, or the 't Hooft loop for\nthe dual Higgs phase, is shown to imply the existence of more than one possible\nchoice of algebras for the same underlying theory. A natural entropic order\nparameter arises by this non-uniqueness. We display aspects of the phases of\ntheories with generalized symmetries in terms of these entropic order\nparameters. In particular, the connection between constant and area laws for\ndual order and disorder parameters is transparent in this approach, new\nconstraints arising from conformal symmetry are revealed, and the algebraic\norigin of the Dirac quantization condition (and generalizations thereof) is\ndescribed. A novel tool in this approach is the entropic certainty relation\nsatisfied by dual relative entropies associated with complementary regions,\nwhich quantitatively relates the statistics of order and disorder parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 18:09:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2021 15:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Unlike many existing\ntrackers that focus on modeling only the target, in this work, we consider the\n\\emph{transient variations of the whole scene}. The key insight is that the\nobject correspondence and spatial layout of the whole scene are consistent\n(i.e., global structure consistency) in consecutive frames which helps to\ndisambiguate the target from distractors. Moreover, modeling transient\nvariations enables to localize the target under fast variations. Specifically,\nwe propose an effective and efficient short-term model that learns to exploit\nthe global structure consistency in a short time and thus can handle fast\nvariations and distractors. Since short-term modeling falls short of handling\nocclusion and out of the views, we adopt the long-short term paradigm and use a\nlong-term model that corrects the short-term model when it drifts away from the\ntarget or the target is not present. These two components are carefully\ncombined to achieve the balance of stability and plasticity during tracking.

The governing equations for this\nproblem originate from a constrained minimization of a non-convex energy\nfunctional, and the most commonly used solver is a staggered solution scheme.\nThis is known to be robust compared to the monolithic Newton method, however,\nthe staggered scheme often requires many iterations to converge when cracks are\nevolving. The focus of our work is to accelerate the solver through a scheme\nthat sequentially applies Anderson acceleration and over-relaxation, switching\nback and forth depending on the residual evolution, and thereby ensuring a\ndecreasing tendency. The resulting scheme takes advantage of the complementary\nstrengths of Anderson acceleration and over-relaxation to make a robust and\naccelerating method for this problem. The new method is applied as a\npost-processing technique to the increments of the solver, hence, the\nimplementation can be done with minor modifications to already available\nsoftware. Moreover, the cost of combining the two acceleration schemes is\nnegligible.

The proposed weighted HFGT\nmodeling and robustness assessment approach is tested using a synthetic\ninterdependent network, comprising of an electrical power system, a water\nnetwork, a district heating network, a natural gas system and a road\ntransportation network. Results demonstrate that system robustness can be\nenhanced via securing system information and mitigating attack strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 21:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

For 1x1 convolutions and\nfully connected layers, we demonstrate geometric mean of speedups of 3.4x over\nthe equivalent dense computation at 90% sparsity and 5.4x at 95% sparsity when\nevaluated on hundreds of test cases in deep learning. For sparse 3x3\nconvolutions, we show speedups of over 5x on use cases in ResNet-50.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 22:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

To assess the trajectory of association of an exposure\nhistory with an outcome, the weighted cumulative exposure index (WCIE) has been\nproposed, with weights reflecting the relative importance of exposures at\ndifferent times. However, WCIE is restricted to a complete observed error-free\nexposure whereas exposures are often measured with intermittent missingness and\nerror. Moreover, it rarely explores exposure history that is very distant from\nthe outcome as usually sought in life-course epidemiology. We extend the WCIE\nmethodology to (i) exposures that are intermittently measured with error, and\n(ii) contexts where the exposure time-window precedes the outcome time-window\nusing a landmark approach. First, the individual exposure history up to the\nlandmark time is estimated using a mixed model that handles missing data and\nerror in exposure measurement, and the predicted complete error-free exposure\nhistory is derived. Then the WCIE methodology is applied to assess the\ntrajectory of association between the predicted exposure history and the health\noutcome collected after the landmark time. In our context, the health outcome\nis a longitudinal marker analyzed using a mixed model. A simulation study first\ndemonstrates the correct inference obtained with this approach. Then, applied\nto the Nurses' Health Study (19,415 women) to investigate the association\nbetween BMI history (collected from midlife) and subsequent cognitive decline\nafter age 70. In conclusion, this approach, easy to implement, provides a\nflexible tool for studying complex dynamic relationships and identifying\ncritical time windows while accounting for exposure measurement errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 00:16:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 08:18:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 19:17:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

The tokens\nin the models are usually fine-grained in the sense that for languages like\nEnglish they are words or sub-words and for languages like Chinese they are\ncharacters. In English, for example, there are multi-word expressions which\nform natural lexical units and thus the use of coarse-grained tokenization also\nappears to be reasonable. In fact, both fine-grained and coarse-grained\ntokenizations have advantages and disadvantages for learning of pre-trained\nlanguage models. In this paper, we propose a novel pre-trained language model,\nreferred to as AMBERT (A Multi-grained BERT), on the basis of both fine-grained\nand coarse-grained tokenizations. For English, AMBERT takes both the sequence\nof words (fine-grained tokens) and the sequence of phrases (coarse-grained\ntokens) as input after tokenization, employs one encoder for processing the\nsequence of words and the other encoder for processing the sequence of the\nphrases, utilizes shared parameters between the two encoders, and finally\ncreates a sequence of contextualized representations of the words and a\nsequence of contextualized representations of the phrases. Experiments have\nbeen conducted on benchmark datasets for Chinese and English, including CLUE,\nGLUE, SQuAD and RACE.

Most conventional domain adaptation (DA) efforts\nconcentrate on learning domain-invariant features to mitigate the distribution\ndisparity across domains. However, it is crucial to alleviate the negative\ninfluence caused by the irrelevant source domain categories explicitly for PDA.\nIn this work, we propose an Adaptively-Accumulated Knowledge Transfer framework\n(A$^2$KT) to align the relevant categories across two domains for effective\ndomain adaptation.

We imputed the arrival dates when they were\nmissing. We compared the estimates from the traveler data to the ones from\ndomestic data. We quantitatively evaluated the influence of each case report\nand knowing the arrival date on the estimation. Findings: We estimated the\ntravel origin's daily exponential growth rate and examined the date from which\nthe growth rate was consistently above 0.1 (equivalent to doubling time < 7\ndays). We found those dates were very close to the dates that critical\ndecisions were made such as city lock-downs and national emergency\nannouncement. Using only the traveler data, if the assumed epidemic start date\nwas relatively accurate and the traveler sample was representative of the\ngeneral population, the growth rate estimated from the traveler data was\nconsistent with the domestic data. We also discussed situations that the\ntraveler data could lead to biased estimates.

The true impact of AI can only be fully realized\nif we can have AI agents continuously interacting with the real world and\nsolving everyday problems.

When there\nis a need to translate images across n domains, if the training is performed\nbetween every two domains, the complexity of the training will increase\nquadratically. Moreover, training with data from two domains only at a time\ncannot benefit from data of other domains, which prevents the extraction of\nmore useful features and hinders the progress of this research area. In this\nwork, we propose a general framework for unsupervised image-to-image\ntranslation across multiple domains, which can translate images from domain X\nto any a domain without requiring direct training between the two domains\ninvolved in image translation. A byproduct of the framework is the reduction of\ncomputing time and computing resources, since it needs less time than training\nthe domains in pairs as is done in state-of-the-art works.

Recent research into unsupervised\nmethods focusses on extending language modelling, for example by combining\nUni-gram modelling with deep neural networks.

The\npresence of impulsive disturbances inevitably affects the distribution of\nnoises and thus largely degrades the performance of traditional AWGN denoisers.\nExisting methods target to compensate the effects of IN by introducing a\nweighting matrix, which, however, is lack of proper priori and thus hard to be\naccurately estimated. To address this problem, we exploit the Pareto\ndistribution as the priori of the weighting matrix, based on which an accurate\nand robust weight estimator is proposed for mixed noise removal. Particularly,\na relatively small portion of pixels are assumed to be contaminated with IN,\nwhich should have weights with small values and then be penalized out. This\nphenomenon can be properly described by the Pareto distribution of type 1.\nTherefore, armed with the Pareto distribution, we formulate the problem of\nmixed noise removal in the Bayesian framework, where nonlocal self-similarity\npriori is further exploited by adopting nonlocal low rank approximation.\nCompared to existing methods, the proposed method can estimate the weighting\nmatrix adaptively, accurately, and robust for different level of noises, thus\ncan boost the denoising performance. Experimental results on widely used image\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method to the\nstate-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 06:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

In the current literature, by\nreferring to the properties of the labels prepared for the training dataset,\nlearning with supervision is categorized as supervised learning (SL) and weakly\nsupervised learning (WSL). SL concerns the situation where the training data\nset is assigned with ideal (complete, exact and accurate) labels, while WSL\nconcerns the situation where the training data set is assigned with non-ideal\n(incomplete, inexact or inaccurate) labels. However, various solutions for SL\ntasks have shown that the given labels are not always easy to learn, and the\ntransformation from the given labels to easy-to-learn targets can significantly\naffect the performance of the final SL solutions. Without considering the\nproperties of the transformation from the given labels to easy-to-learn\ntargets, the definition of SL conceals some details that can be critical to\nbuilding the appropriate solutions for specific SL tasks. Thus, for engineers\nin the AI application field, it is desirable to reveal these details\nsystematically. This article attempts to achieve this goal by expanding the\ncategorization of SL and investigating the sub-type moderately supervised\nlearning (MSL) that concerns the situation where the given labels are ideal,\nbut due to the simplicity in annotation, careful designs are required to\ntransform the given labels into easy-to-learn targets.

The effect of granulation, and even more so of supergranulation, has\nbeen shown to be significant in the solar case. Our study is aimed at\nquantifying the impact of these flows for other stars and estimating how such\ncontributions affect their performance. We analysed a broad array of extended\nsynthetic time series that model these processes for main sequence stars with\nspectral types from F6 to K4, focusing on Earth-mass planets orbiting within\nthe habitable zone around those stars. We estimated the expected detection\nrates and detection limits, and performed blind tests. We find that both\ngranulation and supergranulation on these stars significantly affect planet\nmass characterisation in radial velocity when performing a follow-up of a\ntransit detection, with uncertainties sometimes below 20% for a 1 MEarth, but\nmuch larger for supergranulation. For granulation and low levels of\nsupergranulation, the detection rates are good for K and late G stars (if the\nnumber of points is large), but poor for more massive stars. The highest level\nof supergranulation leads to a very poor performance, even for K stars; this is\nboth due to low detection rates and to high levels of false positives, even for\na very dense temporal sampling over ten years. False positive levels estimated\nfrom standard false alarm probabilities sometimes significantly overestimate or\nunderestimate the true level, depending on the number of points. We conclude\nthat granulation and supergranulation significantly affect the performance of\nexoplanet detectability. Future works will focus on improving the following\naspects: decreasing the number of false positives, increasing detection rates,\nand improving the false alarm probability estimations from observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 07:07:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

Nevertheless, the rich information about personal\nopinions in product reviews, which is essential to answer those\nproduct-specific questions, is underutilized in current generation-based\nreview-driven QA studies. There are two main challenges when exploiting the\nopinion information from the reviews to facilitate the opinion-aware answer\ngeneration: (i) jointly modeling opinionated and interrelated information\nbetween the question and reviews to capture important information for answer\ngeneration, (ii) aggregating diverse opinion information to uncover the common\nopinion towards the given question.

Two kinds of opinion fusion strategies, namely,\nstatic and dynamic fusion, are proposed to distill and aggregate important\nopinion information learned from the opinion mining task into the answer\ngeneration process.

Most\nstate-of-the-art methods have utilized facial priors with deep neural networks.\nThese methods require extra labels, longer training time, and larger\ncomputation memory. In this paper, we propose a novel Edge and Identity\nPreserving Network for Face SR Network, named as EIPNet, to minimize the\ndistortion by utilizing a lightweight edge block and identity information. We\npresent an edge block to extract perceptual edge information, and concatenate\nit to the original feature maps in multiple scales.

Moreover, we define an identity loss\nfunction to preserve identification of SR images. The identity loss function\ncompares feature distributions between SR images and their ground truth to\nrecover identities in SR images. In addition, we provide a\nluminance-chrominance error (LCE) to separately infer brightness and color\ninformation in SR images. The LCE method not only reduces the dependency of\ncolor information by dividing brightness and color components but also enables\nour network to reflect differences between SR images and their ground truth in\ntwo color spaces of RGB and YUV.

To\nensure that each cell average satisfies a local discrete maximum principle\n(DMP), we impose inequality constraints on the local Lax-Friedrichs fluxes of a\npiecewise-linear (P1) approximation. Since the piecewise-constant (P0) version\ncorresponds to a property-preserving low-order finite volume method, the\nvalidity of DMP conditions can always be enforced using slope and/or flux\nlimiters. We show that the (currently rather uncommon) use of direct flux\nlimiting makes it possible to construct more accurate DMP-satisfying\napproximations in which a weak form of slope limiting is used to prevent\nunbounded growth of solution gradients. Moreover, both fluxes and slopes can be\nlimited in a manner which produces nonlinear problems with well-defined\nresiduals even at steady state.

The first custom dataset contains more than one and a\nhalf million speech samples of 20,741 speakers obtained from TEDx Talks videos.\nThe second one includes over twenty one thousand speech samples from 1,595\nactors that are extracted from movie dialogues. Using this data, we analyzed\nhow several factors, such as the number of speakers, number of samples per\nspeaker, sample durations, and diversity of utterances affect uniqueness\nestimates. Most notably, we determine that the discretization of i-vectors does\nnot cause a reduction in speaker recognition performance. Our results show that\nthe degree of distinctiveness offered by i-vector-based representation may\nreach 43-70 bits considering 5-second long speech samples; however, under less\nconstrained variations in speech, uniqueness estimates are found to reduce by\naround 30 bits. We also find that doubling the sample duration increases the\ndistinctiveness of the i-vector representation by around 20 bits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 08:28:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 11:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-04"}

(2) They lack sufficient abilities to utilize\nhigh-level semantics and temporal context information. Inspired by\nfrequently-used cloze test in language study, we propose a brand-new VAD\nsolution named Video Event Completion (VEC) to bridge gaps above: First, we\npropose a novel pipeline to achieve both precise and comprehensive enclosure of\nvideo activities. Appearance and motion are exploited as mutually complimentary\ncues to localize regions of interest (RoIs). A normalized spatio-temporal cube\n(STC) is built from each RoI as a video event, which lays the foundation of VEC\nand serves as a basic processing unit. Second, we encourage DNN to capture\nhigh-level semantics by solving a visual cloze test. To build such a visual\ncloze test, a certain patch of STC is erased to yield an incomplete event (IE).\nThe DNN learns to restore the original video event from the IE by inferring the\nmissing patch. Third, to incorporate richer motion dynamics, another DNN is\ntrained to infer erased patches' optical flow. Finally, two ensemble strategies\nusing different types of IE and modalities are proposed to boost VAD\nperformance, so as to fully exploit the temporal context and modality\ninformation for VAD. VEC can consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods\nby a notable margin (typically 1.5%-5% AUROC) on commonly-used VAD benchmarks.\nOur codes and results can be verified at github.com/yuguangnudt/VEC_VAD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 08:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

As\na main innovation, it exploits the calibration estimated from the prediction of\nthe first CNN to represent the geometric depth information in a coordinate\nsystem that is attached to the ground, and is thus independent of the camera\nelevation. In practice, both the height of pixels with respect to the ground,\nand the orientation of normals to the point cloud are provided as input to the\nsecond CNN. Given the segmentation predicted by the second CNN, the object is\nlocalized based on point cloud alignment with a reference model. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that our proposed two-step approach improves\nsegmentation and localization accuracy by a significant margin compared to a\nconventional CNN architecture, ignoring calibration and height maps, but also\ncompared to PointNet++.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 09:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

Such rapid progress in NLG has necessitated the development of\naccurate automatic evaluation metrics that would allow us to track the progress\nin the field of NLG. However, unlike classification tasks, automatically\nevaluating NLG systems in itself is a huge challenge.

The expanding number of NLG\nmodels and the shortcomings of the current metrics has led to a rapid surge in\nthe number of evaluation metrics proposed since 2014.

We study\nseveral broadly-applicable dimensionless measures of stability and mechanical\ndisorder in simple computer glasses, in which the relative strength of\nattractive interactions -- referred to as `glass stickiness' -- can be readily\ntuned.

We focus on the variational principle\napproach championed by Brandon Carter and collaborators, in which a crucial\nelement is to distinguish the momenta that are conjugate to the particle number\ndensity currents. This approach differs from the \"standard\" text-book\nderivation of the equations of motion from the divergence of the stress-energy\ntensor in that one explicitly obtains the relativistic Euler equation as an\n\"integrability\" condition on the relativistic vorticity. We discuss the\nconservation laws and the equations of motion in detail, and provide a number\nof (in our opinion) interesting and relevant applications of the general\ntheory. The formalism provides a foundation for complex models, e.g., including\nelectromagnetism, superfluidity and elasticity-all of which are relevant for\nstate of the art neutron-star modelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 11:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

One of the reasons is that many imaging modalities, as\nthe ones related to medical sciences, suffer from several shortcomings. The\nmost serious one is the issue of instability. Indeed, it is, nowadays, a common\ncertainty that classical inverse problems of recovering objects from remote\nmeasurements are, mostly, highly unstable. To recover the stability, it is\nadvised to create, whenever possible, the missing contrasts in the targets to\nimage. In this survey paper, we follow this direction and propose an approach\nhow to analyze mathematically the effect of the injected agents on the\ndifferent fields under consideration. These contrast agents are small-sized\nparticles modeled with materials that enjoy high contrasts as compared to the\nones of the background. These two properties allow them, under critical scales\nof size/contrast, to create local spots when excited from far. These local\nspots can be remotely recovered in stable ways. The accessible information on\nthe target are encoded in theses spots.\n  After stating a class of such imaging modalities that enter into this\nframework, as the acoustic imaging, photo-acoustic imaging, optical imaging and\nmore, we provide detailed analysis for first two modalities where the contrast\nagents are micro-bubbles and nano-particles respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 12:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

We map out the ground-state phase\ndiagram as a function of the exchange couplings, using linear spin wave theory\nand real-space perturbation theory. We find a hierarchy of energy scales in the\nground state selection, with the effective dimensionality of the system varying\nin an intricate way as the hierarchy is descended. We derive an effective\ntwo-dimensional anisotropic triangular lattice Ising model with only three free\nparameters which accounts for the observed behavior. Connecting our results to\nexperiment, they are consistent with the observation of a disordered chain\nstate in Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. We also show that the presence of two distinct\ntypes of chain phases has consequences for the field-induced breakdown of the\napparent $U(1)$ octupolar quantum liquid phase recently observed in\nCe$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 13:54:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2020 14:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

We assess abundance trends for 106 bird species in a\nnetwork of eight national park forests located within the northeast USA from\n2006-2019 using a novel hierarchical model. We develop a multi-species,\nmulti-region removal sampling model that shares information across species and\nparks to enable inference on rare species and sparsely sampled parks and to\nevaluate the effects of local forest structure. Trends in bird abundance over\ntime varied widely across parks, but species showed similar trends within\nparks. Three parks (Acadia, Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller, and Morristown)\ndecreased in bird abundance across all species, while three parks (Saratoga,\nRoosevelt-Vanderbilt, and Weir-Farm) increased in abundance. Bird abundance\npeaked at medium levels of basal area and high levels of percent forest and\nforest regeneration, with percent forest having the largest effect. Variation\nin these effects across parks could be a result of differences in forest\nstructural stage and diversity.

At ambient pressure, the insulator-like behavior\ncannot be modeled as a band insulator, but can be described by the\nvariable-range-hopping model for correlated systems. Furthermore, the specific\nheat down to 400 mK has been measured and a significant residual coefficient\ngamma_0=C/T|T->0 is observed, which contrasts the insulator-like state and\nsuggests some quantum freedom of spin dynamics.

It is important to assess if the observed primordial\nabundances can be reproduced by simulations. Numerous studies have shown that\nthe simulations overpredict the primordial $^7$Li abundance by a factor of\n$\\approx$ $3$ compared to the observations. The discrepancy may be caused by\nunknown systematics in $^7$Li observations, poorly understood depletion of\nlithium in stars, errors in thermonuclear rates that take part in the lithium\nand beryllium synthesis, or physics beyond the standard model. Here, we focus\non the likelihood of a nuclear physics solution. The status of the key nuclear\nreaction rates is summarized. Big bang nucleosynthesis simulations are\nperformed with the most recent reaction rates and the uncertainties of the\npredicted abundances are established using a Monte Carlo technique.\nCorrelations between abundances and reaction rates are investigated based on\nthe metric of mutual information. The rates of four reactions impact the\nprimordial $^7$Li abundance: $^3$He($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$)$^7$Be,\nd(p,$\\gamma$)$^3$He, $^7$Be(d,p)2$\\alpha$, and $^7$Be(n,p)$^7$Li. We employ a\ngenetic algorithm to search for simultaneous rate changes in these four\nreactions that may account for all observed primordial abundances. When the\nsearch is performed for reaction rate ranges that are much wider than recently\nreported uncertainties, no acceptable solutions are found.

Over the last few years, it has been recognized\nthat a sharp rise in power on small scales will lead to enhanced formation of\nprimordial black holes (PBHs) and also generate secondary gravitational waves\n(GWs) of higher and, possibly, detectable amplitudes. It is well understood\nthat scalar power spectra with COBE normalized amplitude on the CMB scales and\nenhanced amplitudes on smaller scales can be generated due to deviations from\nslow roll in single, canonical scalar field models of inflation. In fact, an\nepoch of so-called ultra slow roll inflation can lead to the desired\namplification. We find that scenarios that lead to ultra slow roll can be\nbroadly classified into two types, one wherein there is a brief departure from\ninflation (a scenario referred to as punctuated inflation) and another wherein\nsuch a departure does not arise. We consider a set of single field inflationary\nmodels involving the canonical scalar field that lead to ultra slow roll and\npunctuated inflation and examine the formation of PBHs as well as the\ngeneration of secondary GWs in these models. Apart from considering specific\nmodels, we reconstruct potentials from certain functional choices of the first\nslow roll parameter leading to ultra slow roll and punctuated inflation and\ninvestigate their observational signatures. In addition to the secondary tensor\npower spectrum, we calculate the secondary tensor bispectrum in the equilateral\nlimit in these scenarios. Moreover, we calculate the inflationary scalar\nbispectrum that arises in all the cases and discuss the imprints of the scalar\nnon-Gaussianities on the extent of PBHs formed and the amplitude of the\nsecondary GWs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 15:55:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 08:49:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 16:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

We show that our\nframework can spatially transform the inputs in an efficient manner. Meanwhile,\nwe further model the temporal consistency for the person image animation task\nto generate coherent videos. The experiment results of both image generation\nand animation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model. Besides,\nadditional results of novel view synthesis and face image animation show that\nour model is applicable to other tasks requiring spatial transformation.

It is considered that the\ninteraction between the strong magnetic field of neutron star and the wind\nmatter could cause such a long pulse period.\n  In this study, we follow the spin evolution of NS, taking into account the\ninteraction between the magnetic field and wind matter. In this line, as new\nchallenges, we solve the evolution of the magnetic field of the neutron star at\nthe same time, and additionally we focus on the effects of wind properties of\nthe donor. As the result, evolutionary tracks were obtained in which the\nneutron star spends some duration in the ejector phase after birth, then\nrapidly spins down, becomes quasi-equilibrium, and gradually spins up. Such\nevolution is similar to previous studies, but we found that its dominant\nphysics depends on the velocity of the donor wind. When the wind velocity is\nfast, the spin-down occurs due to magnetic inhibition, while the classical\npropeller effect and settling accretion shell causes rapid spin-down in the\nslow wind accretion. Since the wind velocity of the donor could depend on the\nirradiated X-ray luminosity, the spin evolution track of the neutron star in\nwind-fed HMXB could be more complicated than considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 07:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

Among the science cases pursued with CMB-S4, the\nquest for detecting primordial gravitational waves is a central driver of the\nexperimental design. This work details the development of a forecasting\nframework that includes a power-spectrum-based semi-analytic projection tool,\ntargeted explicitly towards optimizing constraints on the tensor-to-scalar\nratio, $r$, in the presence of Galactic foregrounds and gravitational lensing\nof the CMB. This framework is unique in its direct use of information from the\nachieved performance of current Stage 2--3 CMB experiments to robustly forecast\nthe science reach of upcoming CMB-polarization endeavors. The methodology\nallows for rapid iteration over experimental configurations and offers a\nflexible way to optimize the design of future experiments given a desired\nscientific goal. To form a closed-loop process, we couple this semi-analytic\ntool with map-based validation studies, which allow for the injection of\nadditional complexity and verification of our forecasts with several\nindependent analysis methods. We document multiple rounds of forecasts for\nCMB-S4 using this process and the resulting establishment of the current\nreference design of the primordial gravitational-wave component of the Stage-4\nexperiment, optimized to achieve our science goals of detecting primordial\ngravitational waves for $r > 0.003$ at greater than $5\\sigma$, or, in the\nabsence of a detection, of reaching an upper limit of $r < 0.001$ at $95\\%$ CL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 07:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

The reformulation of nonlocal\nfractional-order continuum mechanic framework, by means of VO kinematics,\nenables a unique approach to the modeling of solids exhibiting\nposition-dependent nonlocal behavior. The frame-invariance of the strain tensor\nis leveraged to identify constraints on the definition of the VO. The VO\nnonlocal continuum formulation is then applied to model the response of\nEuler-Bernoulli type beams whose governing equations are derived in strong form\nby means of variational principles. The VO formulation is shown to be\nself-adjoint and positive-definite, which ensure that the governing equations\nare well-posed and free from boundary effects. These characteristics stand in\ncontrast to classical integral approaches to nonlocal elasticity, where it is\nnot always possible to obtain positive-definite and self-adjoint systems. A key\nstep in promoting the use of VO approaches is to identify methodologies to\ndetermine the VO describing a given physical system. This study presents a deep\nlearning based framework capable of solving the inverse problem consisting in\nthe identification of the VO describing the behavior of the nonlocal beam on\nthe basis of its response. It is established that the internal architecture of\nbidirectional recurrent neural networks makes them suitable for nonlocal\nboundary value problems, similar to the one treated in this study.

To address this problem, we propose a\nnovel approach for rapidly and cost-effectively locating new and emerging\ninformal settlements using machine learning and publicly accessible Sentinel-2\ntime-series satellite imagery. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach\nin identifying potential Venezuelan migrant settlements in Colombia that have\nemerged between 2015 to 2020. Finally, we emphasize the importance of\npost-classification verification and present a two-step validation approach\nconsisting of (1) remote validation using Google Earth and (2) on-the-ground\nvalidation through the Premise App, a mobile crowdsourcing platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 04:42:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 18:59:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 02:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

Compared with the white-box attack, a black-box\nsetting is more difficult for less available information related to the\nattacked model and the additional constraint on the query budget. A general way\nto improve the attack efficiency is to draw support from a pre-trained\ntransferable white-box model. In this paper, we propose a novel setting of\ntransferable black-box attack: attackers may use external information from a\npre-trained model with available network parameters, however, different from\nprevious studies, no additional training data is permitted to further change or\ntune the pre-trained model. To this end, we further propose a new algorithm,\nEigenBA to tackle this problem. Our method aims to explore more gradient\ninformation of the black-box model, and promote the attack efficiency, while\nkeeping the perturbation to the original attacked image small, by leveraging\nthe Jacobian matrix of the pre-trained white-box model. We show the optimal\nperturbations are closely related to the right singular vectors of the Jacobian\nmatrix. Further experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 show that even the\nunlearnable pre-trained white-box model could also significantly boost the\nefficiency of the black-box attack and our proposed method could further\nimprove the attack efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 07:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

Unfortunately, in the case of the Brugada\nSyndrome (BrS), a rare and inherited heart disease, only one diagnostic\ncriterion exists, namely, a typical pattern in the Electrocardiogram (ECG). In\nthe following treatise, we question whether the investigation of ECG strips by\nthe means of machine learning methods improves the detection of BrS positive\ncases and hence, the diagnostic process. We propose a pipeline that reads in\nscanned images of ECGs, and transforms the encaptured signals to digital\ntime-voltage data after several processing steps. Then, we present a long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) classifier that is built based on the previously\nextracted data and that makes the diagnosis.
