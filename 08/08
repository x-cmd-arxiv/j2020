In many of such\napplications, control can only be implemented at the population level, i.e.,\nthrough broadcasting an input signal to all the systems in the population, and\nthis new control paradigm challenges the classical systems theory. In recent\nyears, considerable efforts have been made to investigate controllability\nproperties of ensemble systems, and most works emphasized on linear and some\nforms of bilinear and nonlinear ensemble systems. In this paper, we study\ncontrollability of a broad class of bilinear ensemble systems defined on\nsemisimple Lie groups, for which we define the notion of ensemble\ncontrollability through a Riemannian structure of the state space Lie group.\nLeveraging the Cartan decomposition of semisimple Lie algebras in\nrepresentation theory, we develop a \\emph{covering method} that decomposes the\nstate space Lie group into a collection of Lie subgroups generating the Lie\ngroup, which enables the determination of ensemble controllability by\ncontrollability of the subsystems evolving on these Lie subgroups. Using the\ncovering method, we show the equivalence between ensemble and classical\ncontrollability, i.e., controllability of each individual system in the\nensemble implies ensemble controllability, for bilinear ensemble systems\nevolving on semisimple Lie groups. This equivalence makes the examination of\ncontrollability for infinite-dimensional ensemble systems as tractable as for a\nfinite-dimensional single system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 16:05:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

Sometimes, the upstream compressional boundary can further steepen into\na secondary shock, which has been observed to accelerate particles and\ncontribute to the primary shock acceleration. However, secondary shock\nformation conditions and processes are not fully understood. Using\nparticle-in-cell simulations, we reveal how secondary shocks are formed.

The reason is that these one-stage detectors, e.g.,\nSingle Shot Multi-Box Detector (SSD), extract temporal features only applying a\nsingle-level layer for each head, which is not discriminative enough to perform\nclassification and regression. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level Temporal\nPyramid Network (MLTPN) to improve the discrimination of the features.\nSpecially, we first fuse the features from multiple layers with different\ntemporal resolutions, to encode multi-layer temporal information. We then apply\na multi-level feature pyramid architecture on the features to enhance their\ndiscriminative abilities. Finally, we design a simple yet effective feature\nfusion module to fuse the multi-level multi-scale features. By this means, the\nproposed MLTPN can learn rich and discriminative features for different action\ninstances with different durations.

While virtual environments are ruled by\nphysics, e.g. object weights and surface frictions, the absence of force\nfeedback makes the task challenging, as even slight inaccuracies on finger tips\nor contact points from HPE may make the interactions fail. Prior arts simply\ngenerate contact forces in the direction of the fingers' closures, when finger\njoints penetrate virtual objects. Although useful for simple grasping\nscenarios, they cannot be applied to dexterous manipulations such as in-hand\nmanipulation. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL)\napproaches train agents that learn skills by using task-specific rewards,\nwithout considering any online user input. In this work, we propose to learn a\nmodel that maps noisy input hand poses to target virtual poses, which\nintroduces the needed contacts to accomplish the tasks on a physics simulator.\nThe agent is trained in a residual setting by using a model-free hybrid RL+IL\napproach. A 3D hand pose estimation reward is introduced leading to an\nimprovement on HPE accuracy when the physics-guided corrected target poses are\nremapped to the input space. As the model corrects HPE errors by applying minor\nbut crucial joint displacements for contacts, this helps to keep the generated\nmotion visually close to the user input. Since HPE sequences performing\nsuccessful virtual interactions do not exist, a data generation scheme to train\nand evaluate the system is proposed. We test our framework in two applications\nthat use hand pose estimates for dexterous manipulations: hand-object\ninteractions in VR and hand-object motion reconstruction in-the-wild.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 17:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

This indicates that the NuSTAR spectra of the\nmajority of our sample are dominated by the thermal corona emission, and the\n$E_{cut}$ distribution of the sample is indistinguishable from that of a radio\nquiet one in literature. The flatter NuSTAR spectra we observed, comparing with\nradio quiet sources, are thus unlikely due to jet contamination. The radio\ngalaxies also show weaker X-ray reflection (both in R and Fe K$\\alpha$ line EW)\ncomparing with radio quiet ones. Combining with the radio quiet sample we see a\ncorrelation between R and EW, but with considerably large scatter.

To integrate the knowledge about localization accuracy in motion\nplanning algorithms, a central task is to quantify the amount of information\nthat an image taken at a 6 degree-of-freedom pose brings for localization,\nwhich is often represented by the Fisher information. However, computing the\nFisher information from a set of sparse landmarks (i.e., a point cloud), which\nis the most common map for visual localization, is inefficient. This approach\nscales linearly with the number of landmarks in the environment and does not\nallow the reuse of the computed Fisher information. To overcome these\ndrawbacks, we propose the first dedicated map representation for evaluating the\nFisher information of 6 degree-of-freedom visual localization for\nperception-aware motion planning. By formulating the Fisher information and\nsensor visibility carefully, we are able to separate the rotational invariant\ncomponent from the Fisher information and store it in a voxel grid, namely the\nFisher information field. This step only needs to be performed once for a known\nenvironment. The Fisher information for arbitrary poses can then be computed\nfrom the field in constant time, eliminating the need of costly iterating all\nthe 3D landmarks at the planning time. Experimental results show that the\nproposed Fisher information field can be applied to different motion planning\nalgorithms and is at least one order-of-magnitude faster than using the point\ncloud directly. Moreover,the proposed map representation is differentiable,\nresulting in better performance than the point cloud when used in trajectory\noptimization algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 18:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

We ask the\nquestion of whether there is a procedure, computable by hand, which can\ncalculate the appropriate premium tax credit for any household with\nself-employment income. We motivate current IRS tax guidance, which has had\nself-employed taxpayers use a fixed point iteration to calculate their premium\ntax credits since 2014. Then, we give an example showing that the IRS iteration\ncan lead to a divergent sequence of iterates. As a consequence, IRS guidance\ndoes not calculate appropriate premium tax credits for tax returns in certain\nincome intervals, adversely affecting eligible beneficiaries. A bisection\nprocedure for calculating premium tax credits is proposed. We prove that this\nprocedure calculates appropriate premium tax credits for a model of simple tax\nreturns. This is generalized to the case where premium tax credits are received\nin advance, which is the most common one in applications. We outline the\nproblem of calculating appropriate premium tax credits for models of general\ntax returns. While the bisection procedure will work with the tax code in its\ncurrent configuration, it could fail, eg, in states which have not expanded\nMedicaid, if a new deduction with certain properties were to arise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 19:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

However, the increasing size of real-world networks becomes a major\nhurdle in order to understand their structure and topological features.\nTherefore, mapping the original network into a smaller one while preserving its\ninformation is an important issue. Extracting the so-called backbone of a\nnetwork is a very challenging problem that is generally handled either by\ncoarse-graining or filter-based methods. Coarse-graining methods reduce the\nnetwork size by grouping similar nodes, while filter-based methods prune the\nnetwork by discarding nodes or edges based on a statistical property. In this\npaper, we propose and investigate two filter-based methods exploiting the\noverlapping community structure in order to extract the backbone in weighted\nnetworks. Indeed, highly connected nodes (hubs) and overlapping nodes are at\nthe heart of the network. In the first method, called \"overlapping nodes ego\nbackbone\", the backbone is formed simply from the set of overlapping nodes and\ntheir neighbors. In the second method, called \"overlapping nodes and hubs\nbackbone\", the backbone is formed from the set of overlapping nodes and the\nhubs. For both methods, the links with the lowest weights are removed from the\nnetwork as long as a backbone with a single connected component is preserved.\nExperiments have been performed on real-world weighted networks originating\nfrom various domains (social, co-appearance, collaboration, biological, and\ntechnological) and different sizes. Results show that both backbone extraction\nmethods are quite similar. Furthermore, comparison with the most influential\nalternative filtering method demonstrates the greater ability of the proposed\nbackbones extraction methods to uncover the most relevant parts of the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 21:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

While template-based DRG provides high precision and highly\npredictable responses, they usually lack in terms of generating diverse and\nnatural responses when compared to (neural) corpus-based approaches.\nConversely, while corpus-based DRG methods are able to generate natural\nresponses, we cannot guarantee their precision or predictability. Moreover, the\ndiversity of responses produced by today's corpus-based DRG methods is still\nlimited.

Instead of generating a response from scratch, P2-Net\ngenerates system responses by paraphrasing template-based responses. To\nguarantee the precision of responses, P2-Net learns to separate a response into\nits semantics, context influence, and paraphrasing noise, and to keep the\nsemantics unchanged during paraphrasing. To introduce diversity, P2-Net\nrandomly samples previous conversational utterances as prototypes, from which\nthe model can then extract speaking style information.

To monitor\ntheir behavior and extract their geometric characteristics, an accurate and\ninstant measurement of vehicles plays a vital role in traffic and\ntransportation fields. Point clouds acquired from the mobile laser scanning\n(MLS) system deliver 3D information of road scenes with unprecedented detail.\nThey have proven to be an adequate data source in the fields of intelligent\ntransportation and autonomous driving, especially for extracting vehicles.\nHowever, acquired 3D point clouds of vehicles from MLS systems are inevitably\nincomplete due to object occlusion or self-occlusion. To tackle this problem,\nwe proposed a neural network to synthesize complete, dense, and uniform point\nclouds for vehicles from MLS data, named Vehicle Points Completion-Net\n(VPC-Net).

In the first\nstrategy, the relay helps the destination by sending its local optimal integer\ncoefficient vector without taking into account that the resulting integer\ncoefficient matrix at the destination is full rank.

Recurrent\neruptions occurred from the SW sub-region over different evolutionary phases,\nwhich provided a unique opportunity to isolate the physical processes\nresponsible for solar eruptions. Persistent shearing and convergence of\nopposite magnetic polarities led to continuous flux cancellation along the SW\npolarity inversion line (PIL). A filament persistently lying along the SW-PIL\nwas observed to survive each eruption, which suggests the partial eruption of\nthe magnetic system. Further, following the first and second eruptions, a\nsigmoidal magnetic structure of similar morphology was reformed along the\nSW-PIL. The photospheric motion of magnetic flux continuously injected and\nstored the negative helicity in the partially erupted magnetic system and built\nup the magnetic free energy for the successive eruptions.

We performed an extensive multi-wavelength\ncampaign with the Effelsberg telescope, the Green Bank telescope and the\nArecibo Observatory to shadow the Gran Telescope Canaria (optical), NuSTAR\n(X-ray) and INTEGRAL (gamma-ray).

Most state-of-the-art methods heavily rely on dense\noptical flow as motion representation. Although combining optical flow with RGB\nframes as input can achieve excellent recognition performance, the optical flow\nextraction is very time-consuming. This undoubtably will count against\nreal-time action recognition. In this paper, we shed light on fast action\nrecognition by lifting the reliance on optical flow. Our motivation lies in the\nobservation that small displacements of motion boundaries are the most critical\ningredients for distinguishing actions, so we design a novel motion cue called\nPersistence of Appearance (PA). In contrast to optical flow, our PA focuses\nmore on distilling the motion information at boundaries. Also, it is more\nefficient by only accumulating pixel-wise differences in feature space, instead\nof using exhaustive patch-wise search of all the possible motion vectors. Our\nPA is over 1000x faster (8196fps vs. 8fps) than conventional optical flow in\nterms of motion modeling speed. To further aggregate the short-term dynamics in\nPA to long-term dynamics, we also devise a global temporal fusion strategy\ncalled Various-timescale Aggregation Pooling (VAP) that can adaptively model\nlong-range temporal relationships across various timescales. We finally\nincorporate the proposed PA and VAP to form a unified framework called\nPersistent Appearance Network (PAN) with strong temporal modeling ability.\nExtensive experiments on six challenging action recognition benchmarks verify\nthat our PAN outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods at low FLOPs.

In this way, we significantly improve the\nefficiency of finding a safe and dynamically feasible trajectory. Then, we\nrefine the smoothness and continuity of the trajectory in an optimization\nframework, which incorporates the homotopy constraint to guarantee the safety\nof the trajectory. The optimization program is formulated as a sequence of\nquadratic programmings (QPs) and can be iteratively solved in a few\nmilliseconds. Finally, the proposed system is integrated into a fully\nautonomous quadrotor and validated in various simulated and real-world\nscenarios.

The proposed method allows us to update the POD functional basis\nconstructed for a specific problem setting in order to match varying boundary\nconditions, such as modified well locations and geometry, without the necessity\nto recalculate each time the whole set of basis functions. Such an adaptive\ntechnique allows us to significantly reduce the number of snapshots required to\ncalculate the new basis, and hence reduce the computational cost of the\nsimulations.

This can lead to\nan imbalance between different levels of features, in particular a serious lack\nof detailed information in the high-level features, which makes it difficult to\nget accurate bounding boxes. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-pronged\ntransductive idea to explore the relationship among different layers in both\nbackward and forward directions, which can enrich the semantic information of\nlow-level features and detailed information of high-level features at the same\ntime. Under the guidance of the two-pronged idea, we propose a Two-Pronged\nNetwork (TPNet) to achieve bidirectional transfer between high-level features\nand low-level features, which is useful for accurately detecting object at\ndifferent scales.

However, for a given DNN, identifying the optimal partition configuration\nfor distributing the DNN that maximizes performance is a significant challenge.\nThis is because the combination of potential target hardware resources that\nmaximizes performance and the sequence of layers of the DNN that should be\ndistributed across the target resources needs to be determined, while\naccounting for user-defined objectives/constraints for partitioning. This paper\npresents Scission, a tool for automated benchmarking of DNNs on a given set of\ntarget device, edge and cloud resources for determining optimal partitions that\nmaximize DNN performance. The decision-making approach is context-aware by\ncapitalizing on hardware capabilities of the target resources, their locality,\nthe characteristics of DNN layers, and the network condition. Experimental\nstudies are carried out on 18 DNNs. The decisions made by Scission cannot be\nmanually made by a human given the complexity and the number of dimensions\naffecting the search space.

The core principle of feature selection seems to be to pick a subset of\npossible features by excluding features with almost no predictive information\nas well as highly associated redundant features. In the past several years, a\nvariety of meta-heuristic methods were introduced to eliminate redundant and\nirrelevant features as much as possible from high-dimensional datasets. Among\nthe main disadvantages of present meta-heuristic based approaches is that they\nare often neglecting the correlation between a set of selected features. In\nthis article, for the purpose of feature selection, the authors propose a\ngenetic algorithm based on community detection, which functions in three steps.\nThe feature similarities are calculated in the first step. The features are\nclassified by community detection algorithms into clusters throughout the\nsecond step. In the third step, features are picked by a genetic algorithm with\na new community-based repair operation. Nine benchmark classification problems\nwere analyzed in terms of the performance of the presented approach. Also, the\nauthors have compared the efficiency of the proposed approach with the findings\nfrom four available algorithms for feature selection. The findings indicate\nthat the new approach continuously yields improved classification accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2020 15:39:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

Furthermore, the theory is based on well-established\nand experimentally well-tested grounds in atomic, molecular and optical\nphysics.

An increase in social media usage has also been observed, leading to\nthe suspicion that this has also raised cyberbullying. In this initial work, we\nexplore the possibility of an increase in cyberbullying incidents due to the\npandemic and high social media usage. To evaluate this trend, we collected\n454,046 cyberbullying-related public tweets posted between January 1st, 2020 --\nJune 7th, 2020. We summarize the tweets containing multiple keywords into their\ndaily counts. Our analysis showed the existence of at most one statistically\nsignificant changepoint for most of these keywords, which were primarily\nlocated around the end of March. Almost all these changepoint time-locations\ncan be attributed to COVID-19, which substantiates our initial hypothesis of an\nincrease in cyberbullying through analysis of discussions over Twitter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 22:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

In terms of digital presence, it is speculated that during pandemic,\nthere has been a significant rise in cyberbullying. In this paper, we have\nexamined the hypothesis of whether cyberbullying and reporting of such\nincidents have increased in recent times. To evaluate the speculations, we\ncollected cyberbullying related public tweets (N=454,046) posted between\nJanuary 1st, 2020 -- June 7th, 2020. A simple visual frequentist analysis\nignores serial correlation and does not depict changepoints as such. To address\ncorrelation and a relatively small number of time points, Bayesian estimation\nof the trends is proposed for the collected data via an autoregressive Poisson\nmodel. We show that this new Bayesian method detailed in this paper can clearly\nshow the upward trend on cyberbullying-related tweets since mid-March 2020.\nHowever, this evidence itself does not signify a rise in cyberbullying but\nshows a correlation of the crisis with the discussion of such incidents by\nindividuals. Our work emphasizes a critical issue of cyberbullying and how a\nglobal crisis impacts social media abuse and provides a trend analysis model\nthat can be utilized for social media data analysis in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2020 00:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}
