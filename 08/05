We identify two different types of dynamical degrees\nof freedom: \"trainable\" variables (e.g. bias vector or weight matrix) and\n\"hidden\" variables (e.g. state vector of neurons). We first consider stochastic\nevolution of the trainable variables to argue that near equilibrium their\ndynamics is well approximated by Madelung equations (with free energy\nrepresenting the phase) and further away from the equilibrium by\nHamilton-Jacobi equations (with free energy representing the Hamilton's\nprincipal function). This shows that the trainable variables can indeed exhibit\nclassical and quantum behaviors with the state vector of neurons representing\nthe hidden variables. We then study stochastic evolution of the hidden\nvariables by considering $D$ non-interacting subsystems with average state\nvectors, $\\bar{\\bf x}^{1}$, ..., $\\bar{\\bf x}^{D}$ and an overall average state\nvector $\\bar{\\bf x}^{0}$. In the limit when the weight matrix is a permutation\nmatrix, the dynamics of $\\bar{\\bf x}^{\\mu}$ can be described in terms of\nrelativistic strings in an emergent $D+1$ dimensional Minkowski space-time. If\nthe subsystems are minimally interacting, with interactions described by a\nmetric tensor, then the emergent space-time becomes curved. We argue that the\nentropy production in such a system is a local function of the metric tensor\nwhich should be determined by the symmetries of the Onsager tensor. It turns\nout that a very simple and highly symmetric Onsager tensor leads to the entropy\nproduction described by the Einstein-Hilbert term. This shows that the learning\ndynamics of a neural network can indeed exhibit approximate behaviors described\nby both quantum mechanics and general relativity. We also discuss a possibility\nthat the two descriptions are holographic duals of each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 17:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Indeed, the\ncallback-based event-driven mechanism of Android challenges crash localization\ntechniques that are developed for traditional Java programs. The key challenge\nstems from the fact that the buggy code location may not even be listed within\nthe stack trace. For example, our empirical study on 500 framework-specific\ncrashes from an open benchmark has revealed that 37 percent of the crash types\nare related to bugs that are outside the stack traces. Moreover, Android\nprograms are a mixture of code and extra-code artifacts such as the Manifest\nfile.

The $\\alpha$-parameter value of the extended halo is more\nthan 7 times higher than that of the inner halo.

These rings are likely caused by pressure bumps in the gas profile; a\nsmall bump can induce a traffic jam-like pattern in the dust density, while a\nlarge bump may halt radial dust drift entirely. The resulting increase in dust\nconcentration may trigger planetesimal formation by the streaming instability\n(SI), as the SI itself requires some initial concentration. Here we present the\nfirst 3D simulations of planetesimal formation in the presence of a pressure\nbump modeled specifically after those observed by ALMA. In particular, we place\na pressure bump at the center of a large 3D shearing box, along with an initial\nsolid-to-gas ratio of $Z = 0.01$, and we include both particle back-reaction\nand particle self-gravity. We consider both mm-sized and cm-sized particles\nseparately. For simulations with cm-sized particles, we find that even a small\npressure bump leads to the formation of planetesimals via the streaming\ninstability; a pressure bump does {\\it not} need to fully halt radial particle\ndrift for the SI to become efficient.

Here, we introduce a framework that allows us to\nconstruct theories of continuous spin variables on a curved spacetime. Our\napproach takes advantage of the results of the non-linear field space theory,\nwhich shows how to construct compact phase space models, in particular for the\nspherical phase space of spin. Following the methodology corresponding to a\nbosonization of spin systems into the spin wave representations, we postulate a\nrepresentation having the form of the Klein-Gordon field. This representation\nis equivalent to the semi-classical version of the well-known\nHolstein-Primakoff transformation. The general-relativistic extension of the\nspin wave representation is then performed, leading to the\ngeneral-relativistically motivated modifications of the Ising model coupled to\na transversal magnetic field. The advantage of our approach is its off-shell\nconstruction, while the popular methods of coupling fermions to general\nrelativity usually depend on the form of Einstein field equations with matter.\nFurthermore, we show equivalence between the considered spin system and the\nDirac-Born-Infeld type scalar field theory with a specific potential, which is\nalso an example of k-essence theory. Based on this, the cosmological\nconsequences of the introduced spin field matter content are preliminarily\ninvestigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 08:18:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

Each tailoring excises a digon surrounding a single\nvertex and sutures the digon closed. One phrasing of this result is that, if Q\ncan be \"sculpted\" from P by a series of slices with planes, then Q can be\ntailored from P. And there is a sense in which tailoring is finer than\nsculpting in that P may be tailored to polyhedra that are not achievable by\nsculpting P. It is an easy corollary that, if S is the surface of any convex\nbody, then any convex polyhedron P may be tailored to approximate a homothet of\nS as closely as desired. So P can be \"whittled\" to e.g., a sphere S.\n  Another main result achieves the same reshaping, but by excising more\ncomplicated shapes we call \"crests,\" still each enclosing one vertex.

Thus far,\nthe concept of an \"adversarial perturbation\" has exclusively been used with\nreference to the input space referring to a small, imperceptible change which\ncan cause a ML model to err. In this work we extend the idea of \"adversarial\nperturbations\" to the space of model weights, specifically to inject backdoors\nin trained DNNs, which exposes a security risk of using publicly available\ntrained models. Here, injecting a backdoor refers to obtaining a desired\noutcome from the model when a trigger pattern is added to the input, while\nretaining the original model predictions on a non-triggered input. From the\nperspective of an adversary, we characterize these adversarial perturbations to\nbe constrained within an $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm around the original model\nweights. We introduce adversarial perturbations in the model weights using a\ncomposite loss on the predictions of the original model and the desired trigger\nthrough projected gradient descent. We empirically show that these adversarial\nweight perturbations exist universally across several computer vision and\nnatural language processing tasks.

The event GW170817 was the first observed in the gravitational and\nelectromagnetic spectra, showing through this joint analysis a certain\ncompatibility with the models of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) to explain the\nsignature of this system. Due to the intense magnetic fields of the neutron\nstars, the plasma magnetosphere stays strongly magnetized and the propagation\nof the GW through plasma can excite magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes such as\nAlfv\\'en and magnetosonic waves. The MHD modes carry energy and momentum\nthrough the plasma, suggesting a mechanism to accelerate the matter during the\ncoalescence of the binaries, explaining some characteristics of the fireball\nmodel of the sGRBs. We present a semianalytical formalism to determine the\nenergy transferred by the GW-MHD interaction during the inspiral phase of the\nstars.

Unfortunately, real data sets contain only finitely many\nobservations, limiting the usable resolution of the bins, and so the\nconventional methods can obscure important variations due to the binning.\nFortunately, plotting cumulative deviation of the subpopulation from the full\npopulation as proposed in this paper sidesteps the problematic coarse binning.\nThe cumulative plots encode subpopulation deviation directly as the slopes of\nsecant lines for the graphs.

The implicit discretization yields an\nelliptic equation on the pressure that can be solved for both ideal gas and\ngeneral equation of state (EOS).

Jet and torus morphology are\nalso only visible in cases of differing brightness with respect to the\nsurrounding nebula and favourable alignment with our line of sight. Spectral\nmap analysis involves binning observations with an adaptive algorithm to meet a\nsignal limit and colouring the results based on the desired model parameter\nfits. Minute changes in spectral index become therefore apparent even in cases\nwhere brightness images alone do not suggest any underlying changes.

Such an algorithm was initially presented by Wu (IEEE\nTrans. IT, Jan. 2012), building on properties of the Berlekamp--Massey (BM)\nalgorithm. Wu devised a fast polynomial-update algorithm to construct the\nerror-locator polynomial (ELP) as the solution of a certain linear-feedback\nshift register (LFSR) synthesis problem. This results in a conceptually\ncomplicated algorithm, divided into $8$ subtly different cases. Moreover, Wu's\npolynomial-update algorithm is not immediately suitable for working with\nvectors of evaluations. Therefore, complicated modifications were required in\norder to achieve a true \"one-pass\" Chase decoding algorithm, that is, a Chase\ndecoding algorithm requiring $O(n)$ operations per modified coordinate, where\n$n$ is the RS code length.\n  The main result of the current paper is a conceptually simple syndrome-based\nfast Chase decoding of RS codes. Instead of developing a theory from scratch,\nwe use the well-established theory of Groebner bases for modules over\n$\\mathbb{F}_q[X]$ (where $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is the finite field of $q$ elements,\nfor $q$ a prime power). The basic observation is that instead of Wu's LFSR\nsynthesis problem, it is much simpler to consider \"the right\" minimization\nproblem over a module. The solution to this minimization problem is a simple\npolynomial-update algorithm that avoids syndrome updates and works seamlessly\nwith vectors of evaluations. As a result, we obtain a conceptually simple\nalgorithm for one-pass Chase decoding of RS codes. Our algorithm is general\nenough to work with any algorithm that finds a Groebner basis for the solution\nmodule of the key equation as the initial algorithm (including the Euclidean\nalgorithm), and it is not tied only to the BM algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 19:52:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 07:21:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 17:58:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

However, the\nlong acquisition time required by conventional 3D high-resolution $T_2^*$\nmapping method causes discomfort to patients and introduces motion artifacts to\nreconstructed images, which limits its wider applicability. In this paper we\naddress this issue by performing $T_2^*$ mapping from undersampled data using\ncompressive sensing (CS). We formulate the reconstruction as a nonconvex\nproblem that can be decomposed into two subproblems. They can be solved either\nseparately via the standard approach or jointly via the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM). Compared to previous CS-based approaches that\nonly apply sparse regularization on the spin density $\\boldsymbol X_0$ and the\nrelaxation rate $\\boldsymbol R_2^*$, our formulation enforces additional sparse\npriors on the $T_2^*$-weighted images at multiple echoes to improve the\nreconstruction performance.

An experimental factor selectively influences a vertex if\nchanging the level of the factor changes parameter values on arcs descending\nfrom that vertex and on no others. Earlier work shows that if each of two\nexperimental factors selectively influences a different vertex in an arbitrary\nMPT it is equivalent for the factors to one of two relatively simple MPTs.\nWhich of the two applies depends on whether the two selectively influenced\nvertices are ordered by the factors or not.

Self-consistency uses the simple\nobservation that the results of semantic segmentation for a specific image\nshould not change under transformations like horizontal flipping (i.e., the\nresults should only be flipped). In other words, the output of a model should\nbe consistent under equivariant transformations. The self-supervisory signal of\nself-consistency is particularly helpful during active learning since the model\nis prone to overfitting when there is only a small amount of labeled training\ndata. In our proposed active learning framework, we iteratively extract small\nimage patches that need to be labeled, by selecting image patches that have\nhigh uncertainty (high entropy) under equivariant transformations. We enforce\npixel-wise self-consistency between the outputs of segmentation network for\neach image and its transformation (horizontally flipped) to utilize the rich\nself-supervisory information and reduce the uncertainty of the network.

After a cancer diagnosis, staging provides essential information\nabout the extent of disease in the body and the expected response to a\nparticular treatment. The leading importance of classifying cancer patients at\nthe early stage into high or low-risk groups has led many research teams, both\nfrom the biomedical and bioinformatics field, to study the application of Deep\nLearning (DL) methods. The ability of DL to detect critical features from\ncomplex datasets is a significant achievement in early diagnosis and cell\ncancer progression. In this paper, we focus the attention on osteosarcoma.\nOsteosarcoma is one of the primary malignant bone tumors which usually afflicts\npeople in adolescence. Our contribution to the classification of osteosarcoma\ncells is made as follows: a DL approach is applied to discriminate human\nMesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) from osteosarcoma cells and to classify the\ndifferent cell populations under investigation. Glass slides of differ-ent cell\npopulations were cultured including MSCs, differentiated in healthy bone cells\n(osteoblasts) and osteosarcoma cells, both single cell populations or mixed.\nImages of such samples of isolated cells (single-type of mixed) are recorded\nwith traditional optical microscopy. DL is then applied to identify and\nclassify single cells. Proper data augmentation techniques and cross-fold\nvalidation are used to appreciate the capabilities of a convolutional neural\nnetwork to address the cell detection and classification problem. Based on the\nresults obtained on individual cells, and to the versatility and scalability of\nour DL approach, the next step will be its application to discriminate and\nclassify healthy or cancer tissues to advance digital pathology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 22:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-06"}

To solve a frequency-domain wave equation, we often need to invert the\nimpedance matrix. This results in a dramatic increase in computational cost as\nthe model size increases. It is even a bigger challenge for anisotropic media,\nwhere the impedance matrix is far more complex. To address this issue, we use\nthe emerging paradigm of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to obtain\nwavefield solutions for an acoustic wave equation for transversely isotropic\n(TI) media with a vertical axis of symmetry (VTI). PINNs utilize the concept of\nautomatic differentiation to calculate its partial derivatives. Thus, we use\nthe wave equation as a loss function to train a neural network to provide\nfunctional solutions to form of the acoustic VTI wave equation. Instead of\npredicting the pressure wavefields directly, we solve for the scattered\npressure wavefields to avoid dealing with the point source singularity. We use\nthe spatial coordinates as input data to the network, which outputs the real\nand imaginary parts of the scattered wavefields and auxiliary function. After\ntraining a deep neural network (NN), we can evaluate the wavefield at any point\nin space instantly using this trained NN. We demonstrate these features on a\nsimple anomaly model and a layered model. Additional tests on a modified 3D\nOverthrust model and a model with irregular topography also show the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 22:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Using synthetic data generated from\nthe 3D model of the cultural site to train the algorithms can reduce these\ncosts. On the other hand, when these models are tested with real images, a\nsignificant drop in performance is observed due to the differences between real\nand synthetic images. In this study we consider the problem of Unsupervised\nDomain Adaptation for object detection in cultural sites. To address this\nproblem, we created a new dataset containing both synthetic and real images of\n16 different artworks.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel unsupervised learning-based framework to achieve accurate and\nefficient multi-contrast MR image registrations. Specifically, an end-to-end\ncoarse-to-fine network architecture consisting of affine and deformable\ntransformations is designed to improve the robustness and achieve end-to-end\nregistration. Furthermore, a dual consistency constraint and a new prior\nknowledge-based loss function are developed to enhance the registration\nperformances. The proposed method has been evaluated on a clinical dataset\ncontaining 555 cases, and encouraging performances have been achieved. Compared\nto the commonly utilized registration methods, including VoxelMorph, SyN, and\nLT-Net, the proposed method achieves better registration performance with a\nDice score of 0.8397 in identifying stroke lesions. With regards to the\nregistration speed, our method is about 10 times faster than the most\ncompetitive method of SyN (Affine) when testing on a CPU.

However,\npausing CPR during a pulseless rhythm can worsen patient outcome. Our objective\nis to design an ECG-based algorithm that predicts pulse status during\nuninterrupted CPR and evaluate its performance. Methods: We evaluated 383\npatients being treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using defibrillator\ndata. We collected paired and immediately adjacent ECG segments having an\norganized rhythm. Segments were collected during the 10s period of ongoing CPR\nprior to a pulse check, and 5s segments without CPR during the pulse check. ECG\nsegments with or without a pulse were identified by the audio annotation of a\nparamedic's pulse check findings and recorded blood pressures. We developed an\nalgorithm to predict the clinical pulse status based on the wavelet transform\nof the bandpass-filtered ECG, applying principle component analysis. We then\ntrained a linear discriminant model using 3 principle component modes. Model\nperformance was evaluated on test group segments with and without CPR using\nreceiver operating curves and according to the initial arrest rhythm. Results:\nThere were 230 patients (540 pulse checks) in the training set and 153 patients\n(372 pulse checks) in the test set. Overall 38% (351/912) of checks had a\nspontaneous pulse. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve\n(AUCs) for predicting pulse status with and without CPR on test data were 0.84\nand 0.89, respectively. Conclusion: A novel ECG-based algorithm demonstrates\npotential to improve resuscitation by predicting presence of a spontaneous\npulse without pausing CPR. Significance: Our algorithm predicts pulse status\nduring uninterrupted CPR, allowing for CPR to proceed unimpeded by pauses to\ncheck for a pulse and potentially improving resuscitation performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2020 01:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-06"}

As an example, we explain how to solve a\nmatrix-chain multiplication (MCM) problem by DP on GPU. This problem can be\nsequentially solved in $O(n^3)$ steps by DP where $n$ is the number of\nmatrices, because its solution table is of size $n \\times n$ and each element\nof the table can be computed in $O(n)$ steps. A typical speedup strategy for\nthis is to parallelize the $O(n)$ step computation of each element, which can\nbe easily achieved by parallel prefix computation, i.e., an $O(\\log n)$ step\ncomputation with $n$ threads in a tournament fashion. By such a standard\nparallelizing method, we can solve the MCM problem in $O(n^2 \\log n)$ steps\nwith $n$ threads. In our approach, we solve the MCM problem on GPU in a\npipeline fashion, i.e., we use GPU cores for supporting pipeline-stages so that\nmany elements of the solution table are partially computed in parallel at one\ntime.

First, the action space\nexponentially explodes as the number of intersections to be jointly controlled\nincreases. Although a multi-agent RL algorithm has been used to solve the curse\nof dimensionality, this neither guaranteed a global optimum, nor could it break\nthe ties between joint actions. The problem was circumvented by revising the\noutput structure of a deep Q-network (DQN) within the framework of a\nsingle-agent RL algorithm. Second, when mapping traffic states into an action\nvalue, it is difficult to consider spatio-temporal correlations over a large\ntransportation network. A deep graph Q-network (DGQN) was devised to\nefficiently accommodate spatio-temporal dependencies on a large scale. Finally,\ntraining a RL model to jointly control traffic lights in a large transportation\nnetwork requires much time to converge. An asynchronous update methodology was\ndevised for a DGQN to quickly reach an optimal policy. Using these three\nremedies, a DGQN succeeded in jointly controlling the traffic lights in a large\ntransportation network in Seoul.

In an industrial sponsored search system, the retrieved\nkeywords for frequent queries are usually done ahead of time and stored in a\nlookup table. Considering these results as a seed dataset, we propose a\ndata-augmentation-like framework to improve the synonymous retrieval\nperformance for these frequent queries.

In this phase,\na Bag-of-Core-Words trick is conducted, which increased the data increment's\nvolume 4.2 times while keeping the original precision.

(2017) revealed uniform and continuous\nrotation of the magnetic fan-spine. Preliminary analysis of the flare time\nprofiles revealed quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) with similar properties in\nhard X-rays, H\\alpha, and microwaves. In this work, we address which process\nthe observed periodicities are related to: periodic acceleration of electrons\nor plasma heating? QPPs are analysed in the H\\alpha emission from the centre of\nthe fan (inner ribbon R1), a circular ribbon (R2), a remote source (R3), and an\nelongated ribbon (R4) located between R2 and R3. The methods of correlation,\nFourier, wavelet, and empirical mode decomposition are used. QPPs in H\\alpha\nemission are compared with those in microwave and X-ray emission. We found\nmulti-wavelength QPPs with periods around 150 s, 125 s, and 190 s. The 150-s\nperiod is seen to co-exist in H\\alpha, hard X-rays, and microwave emissions,\nthat allowed us to connect it with flare kernels R1 and R2. These kernels\nspatially coincide with the site of the primary flare energy release. The 125-s\nperiod is found in the H\\alpha emission of the elongated ribbon R4 and the\nmicrowave emission at 5.7 GHz during the decay phase. The 190-s period is\npresent in the emission during all flare phases in the H\\alpha emission of both\nthe remote source R3 and the elongated ribbon R4, in soft X-rays, and\nmicrowaves at 4--8 GHz. We connected the dominant 150-s QPPs with the slipping\nreconnection mechanism occurring in the fan. We suggested that the period of\n125 s in the elongated ribbon can be caused by a kink oscillation of the outer\nspine connecting the primary reconnection site with the remote footpoint. The\nperiod of 190 s is associated with the 3-min sunspot oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2020 09:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

Firstly by\nacquiring information from the second task, the shared function leverages\nuseful information that could have been neglected or underestimated in the\nfirst task. Secondly, it helps to generalize the function that can be learned\nusing generally applicable information for both tasks. To fully enjoy these\nbenefits, Multi-task Learning (MTL) has long been researched in various domains\nsuch as computer vision, language understanding, and speech synthesis. While\nMTL benefits from the positive transfer of information from multiple tasks, in\na real environment, tasks inevitably have a conflict between them during the\nlearning phase, called negative transfer. The negative transfer hampers\nfunction from achieving the optimality and degrades the performance. To solve\nthe problem of the task conflict, previous works only suggested partial\nsolutions that are not fundamental, but ad-hoc. A common approach is using a\nweighted sum of losses. The weights are adjusted to induce positive transfer.\nParadoxically, this kind of solution acknowledges the problem of negative\ntransfer and cannot remove it unless the weight of the task is set to zero.\nTherefore, these previous methods had limited success. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel approach that can drive positive transfer and suppress\nnegative transfer by leveraging class-wise weights in the learning process. The\nweights act as an arbitrator of the fundamental unit of information to\ndetermine its positive or negative status to the main task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2020 10:56:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-06"}

The difficulty of this task stems from the\nlimitations of current analytical and numerical techniques to address\nnon-perturbative phenomena in non-Abelian gauge theories. In this work, we show\nhow similar phenomena emerge in simpler models, and how these can be further\ninvestigated using state-of-the-art cold-atom quantum simulators. More\nspecifically, we introduce the rotor Jackiw-Rebbi model, a (1+1)-dimensional\nquantum field theory where interactions between Dirac fermions are mediated by\nquantum rotors. Starting from a mixture of ultracold atoms in an optical\nlattice, we show how this quantum field theory emerges in the long-wavelength\nlimit. For a wide and experimentally-relevant parameter regime, the Dirac\nfermions acquire a dynamical mass via the spontaneous breakdown of chiral\nsymmetry. Moreover, we study the effect of both quantum and thermal\nfluctuations, which lead to the phenomenon of chiral symmetry restoration.\nFinally, we uncover a confinement-deconfinement quantum phase transition, where\nmeson-like fermions fractionalise into quark-like quasi-particles bound to\ntopological solitons of the rotor field. The proliferation of these solitons at\nfinite chemical potentials again serves to restore the chiral symmetry,\nyielding a clear analogy with the quark-gluon plasma in quantum chromodynamics,\nwhere this symmetry coexists with the deconfined fractional charges.

For the model formulation, we introduce the critical\nstate soil mechanics theory (CSSMT), the bounding surface theory and Perzyna's\noverstress theory. The NAFR based EVP model comprises three surfaces: the\npotential surface, the reference surface and the loading surface. Additionally,\nin the model formulation, assuming the potential surface and the reference\nsurface are identical, we obtain the associated flow rule-based EVP model. Both\nEVP models require seven parameters and five of them are identical to the\nModified Cam Clay model. The other two parameters are the surface shape\nparameter and the secondary compression index. Moreover, we introduce the shape\nparameter in the model formulation to control the surface shape and to account\nfor the overconsolidation state of clay. Additionally, we incorporate the\nsecondary compression index to introduce the viscosity of clay. Also, we\nvalidate the EVP model performances for the Shanghai clay,the San Francisco Bay\nMud (SFBM) clay and the Kaolin clay. Furthermore, we use the EVP models to\npredict the long-term field monitoring measurement of the Nerang Broadbeach\nroadway embankment in Australia. From the comparison of model predictions, we\nfind that the non-associated flow rule EVP model captures well a wide range of\nexperimental results and field monitoring embankment data.

In this paper, we\npropose a Spatio-Temporal Consistency Regularization between different output\nfeatures generated from a siamese network including a clean path fed with\noriginal video and a noise path fed with the corresponding augmented video.\nBased on the Spatio-Temporal characteristics of video, we develop two\nvideo-based data augmentation methods, i.e., Spatio-Temporal Transformation and\nIntra-Video Mixup.

On the other hand, in the absence of crowders, the rotational dynamics\nof the Janus probe is independent of self-propulsion force. On replacing the\nrepulsive polymers with sticky ones, translational and rotational mean square\ndisplacements of the Janus probe show a sharp drop. Since different faces of a\nJanus particle interact differently with the environment, we show that the\ndirection of self-propulsion also affects its dynamics. The ratio of long-time\ntranslational and rotational diffusivities of the self-propelled probe with a\nfixed self-propulsion, when plotted against the area fraction of the crowders,\npasses through a minima and at higher area fraction merges to its value in the\nabsence of the crowder.

Functors and monads are at the core of many applications of\nfunctional programming. This raises the question of what useful ADTs for\nverified functors and monads could look like. The functorial map of many\nimportant monads preserves extensional equality. For instance, if $f, g : A\n\\rightarrow B$ are extensionally equal, that is, $\\forall x \\in A, \\ f \\ x = g\n\\ x$, then $map \\ f : List \\ A \\rightarrow List \\ B$ and $map \\ g$ are also\nextensionally equal. This suggests that preservation of extensional equality\ncould be a useful principle in verified generic programming. We explore this\npossibility with a minimalist approach: we deal with (the lack of) extensional\nequality in Martin-L\\\"of's intensional type theories without extending the\ntheories or using full-fledged setoids. Perhaps surprisingly, this minimal\napproach turns out to be extremely useful. It allows one to derive simple\ngeneric proofs of monadic laws but also verified, generic results in dynamical\nsystems and control theory. In turn, these results avoid tedious code\nduplication and ad-hoc proofs.

Three viable options are described,\nestimated and investigated here, two of which -- the material and the total\nradiative (here 'planetary') entropy production rates -- are well-established\nand a third which has only recently been considered but appears very promising.\nThis new option is labelled the 'transfer' entropy production rate and includes\nall irreversible processes that transfer heat within the climate, radiative and\nmaterial, but not those involved in the exchange of radiation with space.\nEstimates in three model climates put the material rate in the range $27$-$48$\nmW/m$^2$K, the transfer rate $67$-$76$ mW/m$^2$K, and the planetary rate\n$1279$-$1312$ mW/m$^2$K.\n  The climate-relevance of each rate is probed by calculating their responses\nto climate changes in a simple radiative-convective model. An increased\ngreenhouse effect causes a significant increase in the material and transfer\nentropy production rates but has no direct impact on the planetary rate. When\nthe same surface temperature increase is forced by changing the albedo instead,\nthe material and transfer entropy production rates increase less dramatically\nand the planetary rate also registers an increase. This is pertinent to solar\nradiation management as it demonstrates the difficulty of reversing greenhouse\ngas-mediated climate changes by albedo alterations. It is argued that the\ntransfer perspective has particular significance in the climate system and\nwarrants increased prominence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2020 14:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Textbook authors\n(e.g. Bertsekas or Puterman) typically give more or less formal proofs to show\nthat the backward induction algorithm is correct as solution method for\ndeterministic and stochastic SDPs.\n  Botta, Jansson and Ionescu propose a generic framework for finite horizon,\nmonadic SDPs together with a monadic version of backward induction for solving\nsuch SDPs. In monadic SDPs, the monad captures a generic notion of uncertainty,\nwhile a generic measure function aggregates rewards.\n  In the present paper we define a notion of correctness for monadic SDPs and\nidentify three conditions that allow us to prove a correctness result for\nmonadic backward induction that is comparable to textbook correctness proofs\nfor ordinary backward induction. The conditions that we impose are fairly\ngeneral and can be cast in category-theoretical terms using the notion of\nEilenberg-Moore-algebra.

This model is sufficiently rich to\ncapture various properties of a real-world communication channel, such as\ndistortion, interference, and nonlinearity. Uncertainties in the plant,\ncontroller and communication channels can be handled simultaneously in the\nframework. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the robust\nfinite-gain stability of an NCS when the model uncertainties in the plant and\ncontroller are measured by the gap metric and those in the nonlinear\ncommunication channels are measured by operator norms of the uncertain\nelements. This condition is given by an inequality involving \"arcsine\" of the\nuncertainty bounds and is derived from novel geometric insights underlying the\nrobustness of a standard closed-loop system in the presence of conelike\nnonlinear perturbations on the system graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2020 14:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-06"}

In this paper, we\nconsider the stochastic simulation optimization problem when input uncertainty\nis present and assume that both the input distribution family and the\ndistribution parameters are unknown.

There are some radiation hydrodynamics\nsimulations for such SNe interacting with a CSM disk. However, such disk\ninteraction models so far have not included the effect of the ionization and\nrecombination processes in the SN ejecta, i.e., the fact that the photosphere\nof Type IIP SNe between $\\sim 10$-$\\sim 100$ days is regulated by the hydrogen\nrecombination front.

Conventional software engineering practices such as\ncomplete re-development and code-based migration, albeit useful in mitigating\nthese obsolescence issues, they are time-consuming and overly expensive. Our\nRoboSMi model-driven approach supports the migration of the software\ncontrolling a robotic system between hardware platforms. First, RoboSMi\nexecutes static analysis on the robotic software of the source hardware\nplatform to identify platform-dependent and platform-agnostic software\nconstructs. By analysing a model that expresses the architecture of robotic\ncomponents on the target platform, RoboSMi establishes the hardware\nconfiguration of those components and suggests software libraries for each\ncomponent whose execution will enable the robotic software to control the\ncomponents. Finally, RoboSMi through code-generation produces software for the\ntarget platform and indicates areas that require manual intervention by robotic\nengineers to complete the migration.

The lightcurves of the source do\nnot show significant variability. From the hardness ratios (3-10 keV/0.3-3 keV\nflux) we infer that the source is not spectrally variable.

Positivity forms the crux of the conformal\nbootstrap, but understanding of the abstract implications of discreteness and\nintegrality for the space of CFTs is lacking. We systematically study these\nconstraints in two-dimensional, non-holomorphic CFTs, making use of two main\nmathematical results. First, we prove a theorem constraining the behavior near\nthe cusp of integral, vector-valued modular functions. Second, we explicitly\nconstruct non-factorizable, non-holomorphic cuspidal functions satisfying\ndiscreteness and integrality, and prove the non-existence of such functions\nonce positivity is added. Application of these results yields several\nbootstrap-type bounds on OPE data of both rational and irrational CFTs,\nincluding some powerful bounds for theories with conformal manifolds, as well\nas insights into questions of spectral determinacy.

We test the validity of this assumption by comparing the final mass of\nstars with the mass of their progenitor cores in a high-resolution\nstar-formation simulation that generates a realistic IMF under physical\nconditions characteristic of observed molecular clouds. Using a definition of\nbound cores similar to previous works we obtain a CMF that converges with\nincreasing numerical resolution. We find that the CMF and the IMF are closely\nrelated in a statistical sense only; for any individual star there is only a\nweak correlation between the progenitor core mass and the final stellar mass.\nIn particular, for high mass stars only a small fraction of the final stellar\nmass comes from the progenitor core, and even for low mass stars the fraction\nis highly variable, with a median fraction of only about 50%.

Yet the stability of the kinetic\nballooning mode (KBM) in a global and realistic magnetotail configuration has\nnot been well examined. In this paper, stability of the KBM is evaluated for\nthe two-dimensional Voigt equilibrium of the near-Earth magnetotail based on an\nanalytical kinetic theory of ballooning instability in the framework of kinetic\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, where the kinetic effects such as the finite\ngyroradius effect, wave-particle resonances, particle drifts motions are\nincluded usually through kinetic closures. The growth rate of the KBM strongly\ndepends on the magnetic field line stiffening factor $S$, which is in turn\ndetermined by the effects of the trapped electrons, the finite ion gyroradius,\nand the magnetic drift motion of charged particles. The KBM is unstable in a\nfinite intermediate range of equatorial $\\beta_{eq}$ and only marginally\nunstable at higher $\\beta_{eq}$ regime for higher $T_e/T_i$ values. The finite\nion gyroradius and the trapped electron fraction enhance the stiffening factor\nthat tends to stabilize the KBM in the magnetotail far away from Earth. On the\nother hand, the current sheet thinning destabilizes KBM in the lower\n$\\beta_{eq}$ regime and stabilizes KBM in the higher $\\beta_{eq}$ regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2020 04:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

We then\nconnect the disfavoured regions of parameter space to existing observational\nconstraints on reionisation such as high-$z$ galaxy ultra-violet (UV)\nluminosity functions, background UV photoionisation rate, intergalactic medium\n(IGM) neutral fraction, the electron scattering optical depth and the soft-band\nX-ray emissivity.

These\ninconsistent models arise from two classes of models: (i) `cold' reionisation\nand (ii) pure matter density fluctuations (i.e. no reionisation). However, a\nsmall subsample of models are consistent implying the existing MWA limits\nprovide unique information in disfavouring models of reionisation, albeit\nextremely weakly.

We consider $N$ classical field configurations dubbed as replicas\nwhich interact with each other via the $\\tau$-derivative terms and evolve with\nthe classical equation of motion. The partition function of replicas is found\nto be proportional to that of quantum field in the imaginary time formalism. As\nthe replica index $\\tau$ can be regarded as the imaginary time index, the\nreplica evolution is technically the same as the molecular dynamics part of the\nhybrid Monte-Carlo sampling and the replica configurations should reproduce the\ncorrect quantum equilibrium distribution after the long-time evolution. At the\nsame time, evolution of the replica-index average of field variables is\ndescribed by the classical equation of motion when the fluctuations are small.\nIn order to examine the real-time propagation properties of replicas, we first\ndiscuss replica evolution in quantum mechanics. Statistical averages of\nobservables are precisely obtained by the initial condition average of replica\nevolution, and the time evolution of the unequal-time correlation function,\n$\\langle x(t) x(t')\\rangle$, in a harmonic oscillator is also described well by\nthe replica evolution in the range $T/\\omega > 0.5$.
