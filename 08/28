At very high\nenergies both single and double Higgs productions rely on the vector-boson\nfusion (VBF) topology. The outgoing remnant particles have a strong tendency to\nstay in the very forward region, leading to the configuration of the \"inclusive\nprocess\" and making it difficult to isolate $ZZ$ fusion events from the $WW$\nfusion. In the single Higgs channel, we perform a maximum likelihood analysis\non $HWW$ and $HZZ$ couplings using two categories: the inclusive Higgs\nproduction and the 1-muon exclusive signal. In the double Higgs channel, we\nconsider the inclusive production and study the interplay of the trilinear\n$HHH$ and the quartic $VVHH$ couplings, by utilizing kinematic information in\nthe invariant mass spectrum. We find that at a centre-of-mass energy of 10 TeV\n(30 TeV) with an integrated luminosity of 10 ab$^{-1}$ (90 ab$^{-1}$), one may\nreach a 95\\% confidence level sensitivity of 0.073\\% (0.023\\%) for $WWH$\ncoupling, 0.61\\% (0.21\\%) for $ZZH$ coupling, 0.62\\% (0.20\\%) for $WWHH$\ncoupling, and 5.6\\% (2.0\\%) for $HHH$ coupling.

Thus, the players wish to join\nthe same facilities as their \"friends\", but this is balanced by them not\nwanting to pay the cost of joining a facility. We first show that the Price of\nStability ($PoS$) of this game is at most 2, and more generally there always\nexists an $\\alpha$-approximate equilibrium with cost at most $\\frac{2}{\\alpha}$\nof optimum. We then focus on how better stable solutions can be formed. If we\nallow agents to pay their neighbors to prevent them from deviating (i.e., a\nplayer $i$ voluntarily pays another player $j$ so that $j$ joins the same\nfacility), then we provide a payment scheme which stabilizes the solution with\nminimum social cost $s^*$, i.e. PoS is 1. In our main technical result, we\nconsider how much a central coordinator would have to pay the players in order\nto form good stable solutions. Let $\\Delta$ denote the total amount of payments\nneeded to be paid to the players in order to stabilize $s^*$, i.e., these are\npayments that a player would lose if they changed their strategy from the one\nin $s^*$. We prove that there is a tradeoff between $\\Delta$ and the Price of\nStability: $\\frac{\\Delta}{cost(s^*)} \\le 1 - \\frac{2}{5} PoS$. Thus when there\nare no good stable solutions, only a small amount of extra payment is needed to\nstabilize $s^*$; and when good stable solutions already exist (i.e., $PoS$ is\nsmall), then we should be happy with those solutions instead. Finally, we\nconsider the computational complexity of finding the optimum solution $s^*$,\nand design a polynomial time $O(\\log n)$ approximation algorithm for this\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

Here, we report our experimental study on SHEL due to forward\nscattering of focused linearly polarized Gaussian and Hermite-Gaussian\n($\\textrm{HG}_{10}$) beams from a silver nanowire (AgNW). Spin dependent\nanti-symmetric intensity patterns are obtained when the polarization of the\nscattered light is analysed.

Furthermore, by\ncomparing the $s_3$ distributions, significant enhancement of the spin-Hall\nsignal is found for $\\textrm{HG}_{10}$ beam compared to Gaussian beam. The\ninvestigation of the optical fields at the focal plane of the objective lens\nreveals the generation of longitudinally spinning fields as the primary reason\nfor the effects.

By monitoring the status of\neach job during training, Pollux models how their goodput (a novel metric we\nintroduce that combines system throughput with statistical efficiency) would\nchange by adding or removing resources.

Data quantify dune wavelength, growth rate, and propagation velocity and\nalso the characteristic length scale associated with the growth process. We\nshow that all these measurements are in quantitative agreement with predictions\nfrom linear stability analysis. This validation makes it possible to use the\ntheory to reliably interpret dune-pattern characteristics and provide\nquantitative constraints on associated wind regimes and sediment properties,\nwhere direct local measurements are not available or feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 17:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 15:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-05"}

Despite its importance in predictive investigations of the\nmagnetosphere - ionosphere coupling, the estimation of ionospheric conductance\nin the auroral region is precarious in most global first-principles based\nmodels. This impreciseness in estimating the auroral conductance impedes both\nour understanding and predictive capabilities of the magnetosphere-ionosphere\nsystem during extreme space weather events. In this article, we address this\nconcern, with the development of an advanced Conductance Model for Extreme\nEvents (CMEE) that estimates the auroral conductance from field aligned current\nvalues. CMEE has been developed using nonlinear regression over a year's worth\nof one-minute resolution output from assimilative maps, specifically including\ntimes of extreme driving of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system.

Countries irrespective of economic\nstatus have succumbed to this pandemic. Many aspects of the lives, including\nhealth, economy, freedom of movement have been negatively affected by the\ncoronavirus outbreak. Numerous strategies have been taken in order to prevent\nthe outbreak. Some countries took severe resections in the form of full-scale\nlockdown, while others took a moderate approach of dealing with the pandemics,\nfor example, mass testing, prohibiting large-scale public gatherings,\nrestricting international travels. South America adopted primarily the lockdown\nstrategies due to inadequate economy and health care support. Since the social\ninteractions between the people are primarily affected by the lockdown,\npsychological distress, e.g. anxiety, stress, fear are supposedly affecting the\nSouth American population in a severe way. This paper aims to explore the\nimpact of lockdown over the psychological aspect of the people of all the\nSpanish speaking South American capitals. We have utilized infodemiology\napproach by employing large-scale Twitter data-set over 33 million feeds in\norder to understand people's interaction over the months of this on-going\ncoronavirus pandemic. Our result is surprising: at the beginning of the\npandemic, people demonstrated strong emotions (i.e. anxiety, worry, fear) which\ndeclined over time even though the actual pandemic is worsening by having more\npositive cases, and inflicting more deaths. This leads us to speculate that the\nSouth American population is adapting to this pandemic thus improving the\noverall psychological distress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 17:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

Previously it has been shown that TDEs with\n$\\beta = r_{\\rm t}/r_{\\rm p} = 1$, where $r_{\\rm t}$ is the tidal disruption\nradius and $r_{\\rm p}$ is the pericenter distance of the star, form an in-plane\ncaustic, or ``pancake,'' where the tidally disrupted debris is compressed into\na one-dimensional line within the orbital plane of the star. Here we show that\nthis result applies generally to all TDEs for which the star is fully\ndisrupted, i.e., that satisfy $\\beta \\gtrsim 1$. We show that the location of\nthis caustic is always outside of the tidal disruption radius of the star and\nthe compression of the gas near the caustic is at most mildly supersonic, which\nresults in an adiabatic increase in the gas density above the tidal density of\nthe black hole. As such, this in-plane pancake revitalizes the influence of\nself-gravity even for large $\\beta$, in agreement with recent simulations. This\nfinding suggests that for all TDEs in which the star is fully disrupted,\nself-gravity is revived post-pericenter, keeps the stream of debris narrowly\nconfined in its transverse directions, and renders the debris prone to\ngravitational instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

To obtain physics-aware device models, we simulate the\nexcess carrier density induced by radiation pulses by solving numerically the\nAmbipolar Diffusion Equation, then use the simulated internal state as training\ndata for the DMD algorithm. Our results show that the significantly reduced\norder delayed photocurrent models obtained via this method accurately\napproximate the dynamics of the internal excess carrier density -- which can be\nused to calculate the induced current at the device boundaries -- while\nremaining compact enough to incorporate into larger circuit simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 18:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

The complexity of the task\narises from the commonly-adopted definition of an abnormal event, that is, a\nrarely occurring event that typically depends on the surrounding context.\nFollowing the standard formulation of abnormal event detection as outlier\ndetection, we propose a background-agnostic framework that learns from training\nvideos containing only normal events. Our framework is composed of an object\ndetector, a set of appearance and motion auto-encoders, and a set of\nclassifiers. Since our framework only looks at object detections, it can be\napplied to different scenes, provided that normal events are defined\nidentically across scenes and that the single main factor of variation is the\nbackground. To overcome the lack of abnormal data during training, we propose\nan adversarial learning strategy for the auto-encoders. We create a\nscene-agnostic set of out-of-domain pseudo-abnormal examples, which are\ncorrectly reconstructed by the auto-encoders before applying gradient ascent on\nthe pseudo-abnormal examples.

With these techniques, GOSH is able to\nembed a graph with over 65 million vertices and 1.8 billion edges in less than\nan hour on a single GPU and obtains a 93% AUCROC for link-prediction which can\nbe increased to 95% by running the tool for 80 minutes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 18:53:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 09:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

The compartmental and spatial models so far proposed use parametric\ndescriptions of the contact rate, often assuming a time-invariant effect of the\nlockdown. In this paper we show that these assumptions may lead to erroneous\nevaluations on the ongoing pandemic. Thus, we develop a new class of\nnonparametric compartmental models able to describe how the impact of the\nlockdown varies in time. Exploiting regularization theory, hospitalized data\nare mapped into an infinite-dimensional space, hence obtaining a function which\ntakes into account also how social distancing measures and people's growing\nawareness of infection's risk evolves as time progresses. This permits to\nreconstruct a continuous-time profile of SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number with a\nresolution never reached before. When applied to data collected in Lombardy,\nthe most affected Italian region, our model illustrates how people behaviour\nchanged during the restrictions and its importance to contain the epidemic.\nResults also indicate that, at the end of the lockdown, around 12% of people in\nLombardy and 5% in Italy was affected by SARS-CoV-2. Then, we discuss how the\nsituation evolved after the end of the lockdown showing that the reproduction\nnumber is dangerously increasing in the last weeks due to holiday relax\nespecially in the younger population and increased migrants arrival, reaching\nvalues larger than one on August 1, 2020. Since several countries still observe\na growing epidemic, including Italy, and all could be subject to a second wave\nafter the summer, the proposed reproduction number tracking methodology can be\nof great help to health care authorities to prevent another SARS-CoV-2\ndiffusion or to assess the impact of lockdown restrictions to contain the\nspread.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 18:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

The White House and a group of industry research labs, lead by the\nAllen Institute for AI, aggregated over 200,000 journal articles related to a\nvariety of coronaviruses and tasked the community with answering key questions\nrelated to the corpus, releasing the dataset as CORD-19. The information\nretrieval (IR) community repurposed the journal articles within CORD-19 to more\nclosely resemble a classic TREC-style competition, dubbed TREC-COVID, with\nhuman annotators providing relevancy judgements at the end of each round of\ncompetition. Seeing the related endeavors, we set out to repurpose the\nrelevancy annotations for TREC-COVID tasks to identify journal articles in\nCORD-19 which are relevant to the key questions posed by CORD-19. A BioBERT\nmodel trained on this repurposed dataset prescribes relevancy annotations for\nCORD-19 tasks that have an overall agreement of 0.4430 with majority human\nannotations in terms of Cohen's kappa.

The evaporation of the solvent drives far-from-equilibrium\nself-organisation of the particles, producing a wide variety of nano- and\nmicro-structured patterns.

Many dedicated studies\ncarried out over the last decade suggest that a dominant contributor to GDXE is\na population of accreting white dwarfs (WDs). The question arises about\nrelative contribution of different subclasses of accreting WD population,\nnamely non-magnetic WD binaries, magnetic intermediate polars (IPs) and polars,\nin different regions of the Galaxy: the Galactic center, bulge, and ridge.\nRecent low-energy (E$<10$ keV) studies indicate that non-magnetic WD binaries,\nin particular quiescent dwarf novae, provide a major contribution to the\ndiffuse hard X-ray emission of the Galactic bulge. From the other side,\nprevious high energy (E$>10$ keV) X-ray measurements of the bulge and ridge\nimply a dominant population of magnetic CVs, in particular intermediate polars.\nIn this work we use side aperture of the NuSTAR to probe the diffuse continuum\nof the inner $\\sim1-3^{\\circ}$ of the Galactic bulge, which allows us to\nconstrain possible mixture of soft and hard populations components of the\nspectrum.

The compact\nbreathers appear in such systems even in the linear approximation. If the\ninteractions are nonlinear, but comply with the flat-band symmetry, the compact\nbreather solutions exist, but can lose their stability for certain parameter\nvalues. As benchmark nonlinear potentials, we use the $\\beta$-FPU\n(Fermi-Pasta-Ulam) and vibro-impact models. Loss of stability is numerically\nobserved to occur through either pitchfork or Hopf bifurcations. The loss of\nstability can occur through two qualitatively different mechanisms -- through\ninternal instability in the basic lattice elements, or through interaction of\nthe compact breather with the linear passband of the lattice. The former\nscenario is more typical for high-amplitude breathers, and the latter -- for\nlow amplitudes. For the high-amplitude case, insights into the nature of\ncompact-mode loss-of-stability are obtained by resorting to the limit of a\npiecewise-linear system, where interactions are represented by conservative\nimpacts. This issue calls for detailed introspection into integrability of\npiecewise-linear (impacting) systems and their relation to the smooth system.\nAn idea for a sensor based on the studied mechanisms is suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 22:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

Existing theories often assume a perfect complete market,\nbut when pricing is linear, there is no diversification benefit from risk\npooling and therefore no role for insurance companies. Instead of a perfect\nmarket, we assume a non-additive distortion pricing functional and the\nprinciple of equal priority of payments in default. Under these assumptions, we\nderive a canonical allocation of premium and margin, with properties that merit\nthe name the natural allocation. The natural allocation gives non-negative\nmargins to all independent lines for default-free insurance but can exhibit\nnegative margins for low-risk lines under limited liability. We introduce novel\nconditional expectation measures of relative risk within a portfolio and use\nthem to derive simple, intuitively appealing expressions for risk margins and\ncapital allocations. We give a unique capital allocation consistent with our\nlaw invariant pricing functional. Such allocations produce returns that vary by\nline, in contrast to many other approaches. Our model provides a bridge between\nthe theoretical perspective that there should be no compensation for bearing\ndiversifiable risk and the empirical observation that more risky lines fetch\nhigher margins relative to subjective expected values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 01:26:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

Results\nshow that structured EM is more robust to class confusion caused by noise and\nobstacles in features in the context of the flood mapping application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 02:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

The challenge lies in\nhow to adequately encode the complex topological information of the networks.\nRecent studies mainly focus on preserving the first-order network topology\nwhich indicates the closeness relationships of nodes. However, these methods\ngenerally fail to capture the high-order topology which indicates the local\nstructures of nodes and serves as an essential characteristic of the network\ntopology. In addition, for the first-order topology, the additional value of\nnon-existent links is largely ignored. In this paper, we propose to learn more\nrepresentative node embeddings by simultaneously capturing the first-order and\nhigh-order topology in signed directed networks. In particular, we reformulate\nthe representation learning problem on signed directed networks from a\nvariational auto-encoding perspective and further develop a decoupled\nvariational embedding (DVE) method. DVE leverages a specially designed\nauto-encoder structure to capture both the first-order and high-order topology\nof signed directed networks, and thus learns more representative node\nembedding. Extensive experiments are conducted on three widely used real-world\ndatasets. Comprehensive results on both link sign prediction and node\nrecommendation task demonstrate the effectiveness of DVE.

Supervised learning algorithms such as\nimitation learning can generalize to new environments by training on a large\namount of labeled data, however, it can be often impractical or\ncost-prohibitive to obtain sufficient data for each new environment. Although\nreinforcement learning methods can mitigate this data-dependency issue by\ntraining the agent in a trial-and-error way, they still need to re-train\npolicies from scratch when adapting to new environments. In this paper, we thus\npropose a meta reinforcement learning (MRL) method to improve the agent's\ngeneralization capabilities to make automated lane-changing maneuvers at\ndifferent traffic environments, which are formulated as different traffic\ncongestion levels.

The current forecasting literature has focused on matching\nspecific variables and horizons with a particularly successful algorithm. In\ncontrast, we study the usefulness of the underlying features driving ML gains\nover standard macroeconometric methods. We distinguish four so-called features\n(nonlinearities, regularization, cross-validation and alternative loss\nfunction) and study their behavior in both the data-rich and data-poor\nenvironments. To do so, we design experiments that allow to identify the\n\"treatment\" effects of interest. We conclude that (i) nonlinearity is the true\ngame changer for macroeconomic prediction, (ii) the standard factor model\nremains the best regularization, (iii) K-fold cross-validation is the best\npractice and (iv) the $L_2$ is preferred to the $\\bar \\epsilon$-insensitive\nin-sample loss. The forecasting gains of nonlinear techniques are associated\nwith high macroeconomic uncertainty, financial stress and housing bubble\nbursts.

However, significant\ndepartures from these correlations have been observed in a number of galaxies.\nThis may happen because AGN luminosity varies on a much shorter timescale\n($\\sim 10^4-10^5$~yr) than outflow properties do ($\\sim 10^6$~yr). We\ninvestigate the effect of AGN luminosity variations on outflow properties using\n1D numerical simulations.

The other is a\ndistortion-adaptive Gaussian kernel that generates a density map ground truth\nwhile taking into account the distortion of stereographic projection. Using the\ncounting of grape bunches as a case study, we constructed an original\ngrape-bunch image dataset consisting of omnidirectional images and conducted\nexperiments to evaluate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed\nmethod performs better than a direct application of the conventional method,\nimproving mean absolute error by 14.7% and mean squared error by 10.5%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 07:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

As of huge interest for mathematicians, historians of mathematics\nas well as of philosophy, there had been an avalanche of studies about it. In\nour work, we revisit this question, for we think something is missing: a global\nanalysis of Plato's text, from these three points of view simultaneously:\nhistory, mathematics and philosophy. It is what we have undertook through a new\ntranslation, a new interpretation of the mathematical lesson about irrational\nmagnitudes and a novel interpretation of the whole passage from these three\npoints of view. Our guideline is considering Plato's writings seriously, not as\nsome playful work. This simple rule is indeed surprisingly constraining, but it\nallows us to get a rare direct glance inside pre-Euclidean mathematics, in\ncontradiction with the 'Main Standard Interpretation' prevailing in history of\nmathematics as well as in history of philosophy. This study had been divided in\ntwo parts for editorial reasons. In the present article, we propose an analysis\nof the first part of this 'mathematical part', Theodorus' lesson.

Modularity reduces complexity and increases reuse of\nbehavior. In this paper we pose and answer the following question: how can we\nidentify independent `modules' within the structure of reactive control\narchitectures? To this end, we propose a graph-structured control architecture\nwe call a decision structure, and show how it generalises some reactive control\narchitectures which are popular in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics,\nspecifically Teleo-Reactive programs (TRs), Decision Trees (DTs), Behavior\nTrees (BTs) and Generalised Behavior Trees ($k$-BTs). Inspired by the\ndefinition of a module in graph theory, we define modules in decision\nstructures and show how each decision structure possesses a canonical\ndecomposition into its modules. We can naturally characterise each of the BTs,\n$k$-BTs, DTs and TRs by properties of their module decomposition. This allows\nus to recognise which decision structures are equivalent to each of these\narchitectures in quadratic time. Our proposed concept of modules extends to\nformal verification, under any verification scheme capable of verifying a\ndecision structure. Namely, we prove that a modification to a module within a\ndecision structure has no greater flow-on effects than a modification to an\nindividual action within that structure. This enables verification on modules\nto be done locally and hierarchically, where structures can be verified and\nthen repeatedly locally modified, with modules replaced by modules while\npreserving correctness. To illustrate the findings, we present an example of a\nsolar-powered drone controlled by a decision structure. We use a Linear\nTemporal Logic-based verification scheme to verify the correctness of this\nstructure, and then show how one can modify modules while preserving its\ncorrectness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 07:25:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 07:22:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 02:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

Classical T Tauri stars (cTTs) are pre-main sequence stars\nsurrounded by an accretion disk.

Studying this interaction is a major goal toward\nunderstanding the properties of young stars and their evolution. Aims. The goal\nof this study is to investigate the accretion process in the young stellar\nsystem HQ Tau, an intermediate-mass T Tauri star (1.9 M$_{\\odot}$). Methods.\nThe time variability of the system is investigated both photometrically, using\nKepler-K2 and complementary light curves, and from a high-resolution\nspectropolarimetric time series obtained with ESPaDOnS at CFHT. Results. The\nquasi-sinusoidal Kepler-K2 light curve exhibits a period of 2.424 d, which we\nascribe to the rotational period of the star. The radial velocity of the system\nshows the same periodicity, as expected from the modulation of the photospheric\nline profiles by surface spots. A similar period is found in the red wing of\nseveral emission lines (e.g., HI, CaII, NaI), due to the appearance of inverse\nP Cygni components, indicative of accretion funnel flows. Signatures of\noutflows are also seen in the line profiles, some being periodic, others\ntransient.

Additionally, we report\nHQ Tau to be a spectroscopic binary candidate whose orbit remains to be\ndetermined. Conclusions. The results of this study expand upon those previously\nreported for low-mass T Tauri stars, as they indicate that the magnetospheric\naccretion process may still operate in intermediate-mass pre-main sequence\nstars, such as HQ Tau.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 08:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Such knowledge\nis very useful for several data analysis problems, such as for deciding on the\nnumber of clusters and determining unimodal projections.

As an\nalternative, we present a static type analysis which is based on plspec.\nInstead of ensuring full type-safety, we aim to statically identify type errors\non a best-effort basis without limiting the expressiveness of Prolog programs.\nFinally, we evaluate our approach on real-world code featured in the SWI\ncommunity packages and a large project implementing a model checker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 09:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

Different from\nthe conventional definition, our Larmor time is defined by aligning the\nmagnetic field along the neutron propagation direction, and this definition\ndoes give reasonable results for motions through a free region and a square\nbarrier. It is worth noting that in the zero magnetic field limit, the Larmor\ntime coincides well with the CRT, which is due to the special shape of linear\nbarrier, and may have some relevance to the weak equivalence principle. It is\nalso found that the classical forbidden region plays an essential role for the\ndwell time $\\tau_{_\\mathrm{DW}}$ to match with the CRT, and the difference\nbetween the dwell and the phase times, \\ie, the self-interference time delay,\nis barrier shape sensitive and clearly shows the peculiarity of the linear\nbarrier.

To train a high-performance\nmodel for CNER, it usually requires a large number of EHRs with high-quality\nlabels. However, labeling EHRs, especially Chinese EHRs, is time-consuming and\nexpensive. One effective solution to this is active learning, where a model\nasks labelers to annotate data which the model is uncertain of. Conventional\nactive learning assumes a single labeler that always replies noiseless answers\nto queried labels.

This is due to its stiffening effect on the quark matter equation of\nstate which arises from the non-linear density dependence of the speed of\nsound. This additional interaction channel allows for the appearance of a quark\ncore at moderately low NS masses, $\\sim 1M_{\\odot}$, and provides the required\nrepulsion to preserve the star stability up to $\\sim2.1M_{\\odot}$. Furthermore,\nwe show that both the heaviest NS mass generated, $M_{\\text{max}}$, and its\nradii, $R_{\\text{max}}$, are quite sensitive to the strength of 8-quark\nvector-isoscalar channel, leading to a considerable decrease of\n$R_{\\text{max}}$ as the coupling increases. This behavior imprints a\nconsiderable deviation from the purely hadronic matter equation of state in the\n$\\Lambda(M)$ diagram, which might be a possible signature of the quark matter\nexistence, even for moderately low NS masses, $\\sim 1.4\\, M_\\odot$. The\nresulting $M(R)$ and $\\Lambda(R)$ relations are in accordance with the latest\nastrophysical constraints from NICER and Ligo/VIRGO observations, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 10:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

Here, we report the details of\nstructural stability and thermoelectric performance of Bi-Substituted p-type\nTaSbRu from first-principles calculations considering theses important\nparameters. This indirect bandgap semiconductor (Eg=0.8 eV by TB-mBJ+SOC) has\nhighly dispersive and degenerate valence bands, which lead to a maximum power\nfactor, 3.8 mWm-1K-2 at 300K. As Sb-5p has a small contribution to the bandgap\nformation, the substitution of Bi on the Sb site does not cause significant\nchange to the electronic structure. Although the Seebeck coefficient increases\nby Bi due to slight changes in the bandgap, electrical conductivity, and hence,\nthe power factor reduces to ~3 mW m-1K-2 at 300K (50% Bi). On the other side,\nlattice thermal conductivity drops effectively to 5 from 20 W/m K as Bi\nintroduces a significant contribution in the acoustic phonon region and\nintensify phonon scattering. Thus, ZT value is improved through\nBi-substitution, reaching 1.1 (50% Bi) at 1200 K from 0.45 (pure TaSbRu) only.\nTherefore, the present study suggests how to improve the TE performance of\nSb-based half-Heusler compounds and TaSbRu (with 50% Bi) is a promising\nmaterial for high-temperature applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 10:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

The\nfirst chapter is dedicated to the study of the vacuum one-loop correction of\nholographic HSGRAs in Anti-de Sitter space. We show that there is a remarkable\nagreement between the $F$-energy of HSGRAs in the bulk and the predictions\ncoming from the dual CFTs in integer dimensions. We extend this result to\ncontinuous dimension and show that vacuum one-loop corrections in HSGRA\nreproduce the $F$-energy of the Wilson-Fisher CFT in $4-\\epsilon$ dimension.\nThe second part of the thesis explores the quantum properties of Chiral Higher\nSpin Gravity - a closed subsector of any other HSGRA in four dimensions. We\nshow that Chiral Theory is UV-finite at one-loop. Moreover, there is an\ninteresting relation between one-loop amplitudes in Chiral HSGRA and the\nself-dual subsector of QCD. The last part of the thesis is devoted to algebraic\nstructures of HSGRAs.

A\nlarge-scale directional detector is attractive in that it would have\nsensitivity below the neutrino floor, be capable of unambiguously establishing\nthe galactic origin of a purported dark matter signal, and could serve a dual\npurpose as a neutrino observatory. We present the first detailed analysis of a\n1000 m$^3$-scale detector capable of measuring a directional nuclear recoil\nsignal at low energies.

Increasing observational\nevidence suggests that planet formation occurs in less than 1 Myr. This\nmotivates the need for spatially resolved spectral observations of Class I\ndisks, as carried out by the ALMA chemical survey of Disk-Outflow sources in\nTaurus (ALMA-DOT). In the context of ALMA-DOT, we observe the edge-on disk\naround the Class I source IRAS 04302+2247 (the butterfly star) in the 1.3mm\ncontinuum and five molecular lines. We report the first tentative detection of\nmethanol (CH$_3$OH) in a Class I disk and resolve, for the first time, the\nvertical structure of a disk with multiple molecular tracers. The bulk of the\nemission in the CO 2-1, CS 5-4, and o-H$_2$CO 3(1,2)-2(1,1) lines originates\nfrom the warm molecular layer, with the line intensity peaking at increasing\ndisk heights, $z$, for increasing radial distances, $r$.

In the outer midplane, the line emission decreases due to\nmolecular freeze-out onto dust grains (freeze-out layer) by a factor of >100\n(CO) and 15 (CS). The H$_2$CO emission decreases by a factor of only about 2,\nwhich is possibly due to H$_2$CO formation on icy grains, followed by a\nnonthermal release into the gas phase. The inferred [CH$_3$OH]/[H$_2$CO]\nabundance ratio is 0.5-0.6, which is 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than for\nClass 0 hot corinos, and a factor ~2.5 lower than the only other value inferred\nfor a protoplanetary disk (in TW Hya, 1.3-1.7).

We carry out an extensive set of calculations using\na variety of different XC-functionals, pseudopotentials and the all-electron\ncode ELK, and we are now able to show that even though under LDA and PW91 a\nhigh-pressure simple-cubic phase does indeed become favourable at the static\nlattice level, when zero-point energies (ZPEs) are included, the transition to\nthe simple-cubic phase is suppressed in every case, owing to the larger ZPE of\nthe SC phase. We reproduce these findings with pseudopotentials that explicitly\ninclude deep core and semicore states, and show that even at these high\npressures, only the $n=3$ valence shell contributes to bonding in sulfur. We\nfurther show that the $Pm\\bar{3}m$ phase becomes even more unfavourable at\nfinite temperatures. We finally investigate whether anharmonic corrections to\nthe zero-point energies could make the $Pm\\bar{3}m$ phase favourable, and find\nthat these corrections are several orders of magnitude smaller than the ZPEs\nand are thus negligable. These results therefore confirm the original findings\nof Whaley-Baldwin et. al.; that the high pressure transition sequence of sulfur\nis $R\\bar{3}m \\rightarrow$ BCC, with no intervening SC phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 13:54:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 14:59:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 10:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

For theoreticians, it provides a powerful tool to\nestablish elegant and easily estimable bounds on the exact error of an MCMC\napproximation at any finite number of iterates. A serendipitous observation\nabout the bias-correcting term leads us to introduce naturally available\ncontrol variates into the L-lag coupling estimators. In turn, this extension\nenhances the coupled gains of L-lag coupling, because it results in more\nefficient unbiased estimators, as well as a better bound on the total variation\nerror of MCMC iterations, albeit the gains diminish as L increases.\nSpecifically, the new upper bound is theoretically guaranteed to never exceed\nthe one given previously. We also argue that L-lag coupling represents a\ncoupling for the future, breaking from the coupling-from-the-past type of\nperfect sampling, by reducing the generally unachievable requirement of being\nperfect to one of being unbiased, a worthwhile trade-off for ease of\nimplementation in most practical situations.

In such systems, an $[n, k]$ code over a finite field\n$\\mathbb{F}_q$ encodes $k$ message symbols into $n$ codeword symbols from\n$\\mathbb{F}_q$ which are then stored on $n$ different nodes in the system.\nRecent work has shown that significant savings in storage space can be obtained\nby tuning $n$ and $k$ to variations in device failure rates. Such a tuning\nnecessitates code conversion: the process of converting already encoded data\nunder an initial $[n^I, k^I]$ code to its equivalent under a final $[n^F, k^F]$\ncode. The default approach to conversion is to reencode data, which places\nsignificant burden on system resources. Convertible codes are a recently\nproposed class of codes for enabling resource-efficient conversions. Existing\nwork on convertible codes has focused on minimizing access cost, i.e., the\nnumber of code symbols accessed during conversion. Bandwidth, which corresponds\nto the amount of data read and transferred, is another important resource to\noptimize.\n  In this paper, we initiate the study on the fundamental limits on bandwidth\nused during code conversion and present constructions for bandwidth-optimal\nconvertible codes. First, we model the code conversion problem using network\ninformation flow graphs with variable capacity edges. Second, focusing on MDS\ncodes and an important parameter regime called the merge regime, we derive\ntight lower bounds on the bandwidth cost of conversion. The derived bounds show\nthat bandwidth cost can be significantly reduced even in regimes where access\ncost cannot be reduced as compared to the default approach. Third, we present a\nnew construction for MDS convertible codes which matches the proposed lower\nbound and is thus bandwidth-optimal during conversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 15:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

In this article, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally a\nmethod to efficiently learn the parameters of resonant interactions for quantum\ncomputers consisting of frequency-tunable superconducting qubits. Such\ninteractions include, for example, those to other qubits, resonators, two-level\nstate defects, or other unwanted modes.

The\npurpose of the offline algorithm is to detect and roughly estimate resonant\ninteractions from a state of zero knowledge. It produces a square-root\nreduction in the number of measurements. The online algorithm subsequently\nrefines the estimate of the parameters to comparable accuracy as traditional\nswap spectroscopy calibration, but in constant time.

The central concept of the detection of\nGWs with PTA lies in measuring the time of arrival difference of the pulsar\nsignal due to the passing of GWs i.e. the pulses get red-shifted.

Traditional wisdom is to use prior knowledge based iterative\nmethods. However, this kind of methods demands a great computational cost.\nInspired by deep learning, here we first develop a deep learning based\nreconstruction method; i.e., U-net with L_p^p-norm, Total variation, Residual\nlearning, and Anisotropic adaption (ULTRA). Specifically, we emphasize the\nVarious Multi-scale Feature Fusion and Multichannel Filtering Enhancement with\na denser connection encoding architecture for residual learning and feature\nfusion.

In particular, we validate our ULTRA networks on three\nlarge-scale spectral CT datasets, and obtain excellent results relative to the\ncompeting algorithms.

The azimuthal anisotropy is estimated using the 2-particle\ncorrelation method, which suppresses the non-flow effects significantly with an\nappropriate pseudorapidity gap of particle pairs. The results from AMPT are\ncompared with estimations from PYTHIA8 (Angantyr) model and it is found that\nwith the chosen pseudorapidity gap the residual non-flow effects become\nnegligible. We found that the high spherocity events have nearly zero elliptic\nflow while low spherocity events contribute significantly to elliptic flow of\nspherocity-integrated events. Our studies indicate that using transverse\nspherocity in heavy-ion collisions, one can enhance and/or suppress the\ncollective effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 18:10:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 09:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

Learning a Bayesian network\n(BN) from data can be cast as an optimization problem using the well-known\nscore-and-search approach.

These include the\ntypical number of cusps per period of string oscillation and the typical values\nof the sharpness parameters of left and right moving waves on the string,\nevaluated at the cusp event. Both of these are important, as the power stored\nin the gravitational waves emitted from the loops of string is proportional to\nthe number of cusps per period, and inversely proportional to the product of\nthe sharpness parameters associated with the left and right moving modes on the\nstring. In suitable units both of these quantities are usually thought to be of\norder unity. In order to try and place these parameters on a more robust\nfooting, we analyse in detail a large number of randomly chosen loops of string\nthat can have high harmonics associated with them, such as one might expect to\nform by chopping off an infinite string in the early universe. This allows us\nto analyse tens of thousands of loops and obtain detailed statistics on these\ncrucial parameters.

This\nwork provides a fast detection system of COVID-19 characteristics in X-Ray\nimages based on deep learning (DL) techniques. This system is available as a\nfree web deployed service for fast patient classification, alleviating the high\ndemand for standards method for COVID-19 diagnosis. It is constituted of two\ndeep learning models, one to differentiate between X-Ray and non-X-Ray images\nbased on Mobile-Net architecture, and another one to identify chest X-Ray\nimages with characteristics of COVID-19 based on the DenseNet architecture. For\nreal-time inference, it is provided a pair of dedicated GPUs, which reduce the\ncomputational time. The whole system can filter out non-chest X-Ray images, and\ndetect whether the X-Ray presents characteristics of COVID-19, highlighting the\nmost sensitive regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 20:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}

However, the open nature of IoT make it vulnerable\nto cybersecurity threats. Especially, identity spoofing attacks, where an\nadversary passively listens to existing radio communications and then mimic the\nidentity of legitimate devices to conduct malicious activities. Existing\nsolutions employ cryptographic signatures to verify the trustworthiness of\nreceived information. In prevalent IoT, secret keys for cryptography can\npotentially be disclosed and disable the verification mechanism.\nNon-cryptographic device verification is needed to ensure trustworthy IoT. In\nthis paper, we propose an enhanced deep learning framework for IoT device\nidentification using physical layer signals. Specifically, we enable our\nframework to report unseen IoT devices and introduce the zero-bias layer to\ndeep neural networks to increase robustness and interpretability. We have\nevaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework using real data from\nADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast), an application of IoT in\naviation.

Our model consists of two coupled terms. The\nfirst term decomposes the correlation matrices into a sparse set of\nrepresentative subnetworks that define a network manifold. These subnetworks\nare modeled as rank-one outer-products which correspond to the elemental\npatterns of co-activation across the brain; the subnetworks are combined via\npatient-specific non-negative coefficients. The second term is a linear\nregression model that uses the patient-specific coefficients to predict a\nmeasure of clinical severity. We validate our framework on two separate\ndatasets in a ten fold cross validation setting. The first is a cohort of\nfifty-eight patients diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The second\ndataset consists of sixty three patients from a publicly available ASD\ndatabase. Our method outperforms standard semi-supervised frameworks, which\nemploy conventional graph theoretic and statistical representation learning\ntechniques to relate the rs-fMRI correlations to behavior. In contrast, our\njoint network optimization framework exploits the structure of the rs-fMRI\ncorrelation matrices to simultaneously capture group level effects and patient\nheterogeneity. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed framework robustly\nidentifies clinically relevant networks characteristic of ASD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 23:43:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

Many polarization fields produce\nthe same electric and magnetic fields, because only the divergence of the\npolarization enters Maxwell's first equation, relating charge and electric\nfield. The curl of any function can be added to a polarization field without\nchanging the electric field at all. The divergence of the curl is always zero.\nModels of structures that produce polarization cannot be uniquely determined\nfrom electrical measurements for the same reason. Models must describe charge\ndistribution not just distribution of polarization to be unique. I propose a\ndifferent paradigm to describe field dependent charge, i.e., to describe the\nphenomena of polarization. I propose an operational definition of polarization\nthat has worked well in biophysics where a field dependent, time dependent\npolarization provides the gating current that makes neuronal sodium and\npotassium channels respond to voltage. The operational definition has been\napplied successfully to experiments for nearly fifty years. Estimates of\npolarization have been computed from simulations, models, and theories using\nthis definition and they fit experimental data quite well. I propose that the\nsame operational definition be used to define polarization charge in\nexperiments, models, computations, theories, and simulations of other systems.\nCharge movement needs to be computed from a combination of electrodynamics and\nmechanics because 'everything interacts with everything else'. The classical\npolarization field need not enter into that treatment at all.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 20:12:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 15:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

In beginning with neither a matter field content nor the geometric\nstructure of an extended 4-dimensional spacetime the properties of these\nentities, together with their mutual correspondence, are derived through the\nconstraints implied in founding the theory upon the general form of proper time\nalone. The geometric structure of the spacetime identified exhibits a locally\ndegenerate description in terms of an inherent ambiguity in the apparent matter\nfield content, in a manner consistent with the Einstein field equation of\ngeneral relativity while also incorporating an intrinsic indeterminacy that is\ncharacteristic of quantum phenomena. Here the quantum properties of all\nnon-gravitational fields arise from this composition of spacetime, rather than\nvia a postulated set of rules applied in spacetime to be extended and applied\nto the gravitational field or spacetime itself. The contrast with several other\napproaches to quantum gravity and the manner in which this framework can\nincorporate the essential properties of general relativity and quantum theory,\nboth individually and in combination, will be elaborated.
