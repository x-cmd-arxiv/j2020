This involvement makes it\ncritical to understand their structure-function relationships.

Due to these limitations,\nthere is need for quantitative characterization methods which can be used\nindependently of m/z values, thus utilizing only normalized retention times. As\nsuch, the primary goal of this article is to construct an LC-MS/MS based\nclassification of the permethylated glycans derived from standard glycoproteins\nand human blood serum, using a Glucose Unit Index (GUI) as the reference frame\nin the space of compound parameters.

Past\nyears have witnessed active development of kinetic modeling of relativistic\nmagnetic reconnection, supporting this magnetically dominated scenario. A much\nless explored issue is the consequence of 3D dynamics, where turbulent\nstructures are naturally generated as various types of instabilities develop.\nThis paper presents a series of 3D, fully-kinetic simulations of relativistic\nturbulent magnetic reconnection (RTMR) in positron-electron plasmas with system\ndomains much larger than kinetic scales. Our simulations start from a\nforce-free current sheet with several different modes of long wavelength\nmagnetic field perturbations, which drive additional turbulence in the\nreconnection region. Because of this, the current layer breaks up and the\nreconnection region quickly evolves into a turbulent layer filled with coherent\nstructures such as flux ropes and current sheets. We find that plasma dynamics\nin RTMR is vastly different from their 2D counterparts in many aspects. The\nflux ropes evolve rapidly after their generation, and can be completely\ndisrupted due to the secondary kink instability. This turbulent evolution leads\nto superdiffusion behavior of magnetic field lines as seen in MHD studies of\nturbulent reconnection. Meanwhile, nonthermal particle acceleration and\nenergy-release time scale can be very fast and do not strongly depend on the\nturbulence amplitude. The main acceleration mechanism is a Fermi-like\nacceleration process supported by the motional electric field, whereas the\nnon-ideal electric field acceleration plays a subdominant role. We discuss\npossible observational implications of 3D RTMR in high-energy astrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 16:18:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 06:43:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

A mixed manna\ncontains goods that everyone likes and bads that everyone dislikes, as well as\nitems that some like and others dislike. The seminal work of Bogomolnaia et al.\n[Econometrica'17] argue why allocating a mixed manna is genuinely more\ncomplicated than a good or a bad manna, and why competitive equilibrium is the\nbest mechanism. They also provide the existence of equilibrium and establish\nits peculiar properties (e.g., non-convex and disconnected set of equilibria\neven under linear utilities), but leave the problem of computing an equilibrium\nopen. This problem remained unresolved even for only bad manna under linear\nutilities.\n  Our main result is a simplex-like algorithm based on Lemke's scheme for\ncomputing a competitive allocation of a mixed manna under SPLC utilities, a\nstrict generalization of linear. Experimental results on randomly generated\ninstances suggest that our algorithm will be fast in practice. The problem is\nknown to be PPAD-hard for the case of good manna, and we also show a similar\nresult for the case of bad manna. Given these PPAD-hardness results, designing\nsuch an algorithm is the only non-brute-force (non-enumerative) option known,\ne.g., the classic Lemke-Howson algorithm (1964) for computing a Nash\nequilibrium in a 2-player game is still one of the most widely used algorithms\nin practice.\n  Our algorithm also yields several new structural properties as simple\ncorollaries. We obtain a (constructive) proof of existence for a far more\ngeneral setting, membership of the problem in PPAD, rational-valued solution,\nand odd number of solutions property. The last property also settles the\nconjecture of Bogomolnaia et al. in the affirmative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 16:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-07"}

As spaces for\nisolated user communities, platforms such as Reddit are increasingly connected\nto issues of racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination. Hence, there is\na need to monitor the language of these groups. One of the most promising AI\napproaches to trace linguistic biases in large textual datasets involves word\nembeddings, which transform text into high-dimensional dense vectors and\ncapture semantic relations between words. Yet, previous studies require\npredefined sets of potential biases to study, e.g., whether gender is more or\nless associated with particular types of jobs. This makes these approaches\nunfit to deal with smaller and community-centric datasets such as those on\nReddit, which contain smaller vocabularies and slang, as well as biases that\nmay be particular to that community. This paper proposes a data-driven approach\nto automatically discover language biases encoded in the vocabulary of online\ndiscourse communities on Reddit. In our approach, protected attributes are\nconnected to evaluative words found in the data, which are then categorised\nthrough a semantic analysis system. We verify the effectiveness of our method\nby comparing the biases we discover in the Google News dataset with those found\nin previous literature. We then successfully discover gender bias, religion\nbias, and ethnic bias in different Reddit communities. We conclude by\ndiscussing potential application scenarios and limitations of this data-driven\nbias discovery method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 16:42:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 18:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

Many of these models are based upon statistical\ntechniques and are good at assessing the current state and making short-term\npredictions; however, as they do not model interactions between stocks, they\nlack predictive power on longer timescales. Additionally, there are mechanistic\nmulti-species models that represent key biological processes and consider\ninteractions between stocks such as predation and competition for resources.\nDue to the complexity of these models, they are difficult to fit to data, and\nso many mechanistic multi-species models depend upon single-species models\nwhere they exist, or ad hoc assumptions when they don't, for parameters such as\nannual fishing mortality. In this paper we demonstrate that by taking a\nstate-space approach, many of the uncertain parameters can be treated\ndynamically, allowing us to fit, with quantifiable uncertainty, mechanistic\nmulti-species models directly to data. We demonstrate this by fitting uncertain\nparameters, including annual fishing mortality, of a size-based multi-species\nmodel of the Celtic Sea, for species with and without single-species\nstock-assessments. Consequently, errors in the single-species models no longer\npropagate through the multi-species model and underlying assumptions are more\ntransparent. Building mechanistic multi-species models that are internally\nconsistent, with quantifiable uncertainty, will improve their credibility and\nutility for management. This may lead to their uptake by being either used to\ncorroborate single-species models; directly in the advice process to make\npredictions into the future; or used to provide a new way of managing\ndata-limited stocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 17:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

However, the utility\nand robustness of these visualization maps has not yet been rigorously examined\nin the context of medical imaging. We posit that trustworthiness in this\ncontext requires 1) localization utility, 2) sensitivity to model weight\nrandomization, 3) repeatability, and 4) reproducibility. Using the localization\ninformation available in two large public radiology datasets, we quantify the\nperformance of eight commonly used saliency map approaches for the above\ncriteria using area under the precision-recall curves (AUPRC) and structural\nsimilarity index (SSIM), comparing their performance to various baseline\nmeasures.

We observe that\n(1) these C2NLOS measurements consist of a superposition of sinusoids, which we\nrefer to as a transient sinogram, (2) there exists computationally efficient\nreconstruction procedures that transform these sinusoidal measurements into 3D\npositions of hidden scatterers or NLOS images of hidden objects, and (3)\ndespite operating on an order of magnitude fewer measurements than previous\napproaches, these C2NLOS scans provide sufficient information about the hidden\nscene to solve these different NLOS imaging tasks. We show results from both\nsimulated and real C2NLOS scans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 17:50:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-07"}

From the\nprimary Kepler mission, KIC 5951458b (Kepler-456b) was thought to be a\nsingle-transit giant planet with an orbital period of 1310 days. However,\nradial velocity (RV) observations of KIC 5951458 from the HIRES instrument on\nthe Keck telescope suggest that the system is far more complicated.

We find that -- contrary to\nprevious results -- the youngest quiescent galaxies are not significantly\nsmaller than older quiescent galaxies at fixed stellar mass. These\n`post-starburst' galaxies only appear smaller in half-light radii because they\nhave systematically flatter color gradients. The strength of color gradients in\nquiescent galaxies is a clear function of age, with older galaxies exhibiting\nstronger negative color gradients (i.e., redder centers). Furthermore, we find\nthat the central mass surface density $\\Sigma_1$ is independent of age at fixed\nstellar mass, and only weakly depends on redshift. This finding implies that\nthe central mass profiles of quiescent galaxies do not significantly change\nwith age; however, we find that older quiescent galaxies have additional mass\nat large radii. Our results support the idea that building a massive core is a\nnecessary requirement for quenching beyond $z=1$, and indicate that\npost-starburst galaxies are the result of a rapid quenching process that\nrequires structural change.

The heating\noccurs both in the crust and ocean, and can exceed that of other tidal sources\nand radiogenic decay if the ocean is inviscid enough. The resulting tidal\ndeformation can be used to constrain subsurface ocean thickness.

Our goal is to study the interplay in\nregions of low-mass star formation through ice- and gas-mapping and by directly\nmeasuring gas-to-ice ratios. This provides constraints on the routes that lead\nto the chemical complexity that is observed in both phases. We present\nobservations of gas-phase methanol (CH$_3$OH) and carbon monoxide at 1.3 mm\ntowards ten low-mass young protostars in the Serpens SVS4 cluster from the\nSubMillimeter Array and the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment telescope.

Finally, we constructed gas-ice maps\nof SVS4 and directly measured CO and CH$_3$OH gas-to-ice ratios. The CH$_3$OH\ngas-to-ice ratio agrees with values that were previously reported for embedded\nClass 0/I low-mass protostars. The CO gas-maps trace an extended gaseous\ncomponent that is not sensitive to the effect of freeze-out. We find that there\nis no straightforward correlation between CO and CH$_3$OH gas with their ice\ncounterparts in the cluster. This is likely related to the complex morphology\nof SVS4: the Class 0 protostar SMM4 and its envelope lie in the vicinity, and\nthe outflow associated with SMM4 intersects the cluster. This study serves as a\npathfinder for future observations with ALMA and the James Webb Space Telescope\nthat will provide high-sensitivity gas-ice maps of molecules more complex than\nmethanol. Such comparative maps will be essential to constrain the chemical\nroutes that regulate the chemical complexity in star-forming regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 18:11:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

Using observations from\nthe Kepler K2 mission, we find that the B9pSi star HD 174356 displays a light\ncurve both variable in amplitude and shape, which is not expected in a CP2\nstar. Employing archival and new photometric and spectroscopic observations, we\ncarry out a detailed abundance analysis of HD 174356 and discuss its\nphotometric and astrophysical properties in detail. We employ phenomenological\nmodeling to decompose the light curve and the observed radial velocity\nvariability. Our abundance analysis confirms that HD 174356 is a silicon-type\nCP2 star.

Stars in close\nbinaries are tidally distorted, so we examine how a star's tidally induced\nasphericity affects its oscillation mode frequencies and eigenfunctions. We\nexplain the pulsation amplitude modulation via tidal mode coupling such that\nthe pulsations are effectively confined to certain regions of the star, e.g.,\nthe tidal pole or the tidal equator. In addition to a rigorous mathematical\nformalism to compute this coupling, we provide a more intuitive semi-analytic\ndescription of the process. We discuss three resulting effects: 1. Tidal\nalignment, i.e., the alignment of oscillation modes about the tidal axis rather\nthan the rotation axis; 2. Tidal trapping, e.g., the confinement of\noscillations near the tidal poles or the tidal equator; 3. Tidal amplification,\ni.e., increased flux perturbations near the tidal poles where acoustic modes\ncan propagate closer to the surface of the star.

Generally it has two steps: generating\ncompleted query candidates according to query prefixes, and ranking them based\non extracted features. Three major challenges are observed for a query auto\ncompletion system: (1) QAC has a strict online latency requirement. For each\nkeystroke, results must be returned within tens of milliseconds, which poses a\nsignificant challenge in designing sophisticated language models for it. (2)\nFor unseen queries, generated candidates are of poor quality as contextual\ninformation is not fully utilized. (3) Traditional QAC systems heavily rely on\nhandcrafted features such as the query candidate frequency in search logs,\nlacking sufficient semantic understanding of the candidate.\n  In this paper, we propose an efficient neural QAC system with effective\ncontext modeling to overcome these challenges. On the candidate generation\nside, this system uses as much information as possible in unseen prefixes to\ngenerate relevant candidates, increasing the recall by a large margin. On the\ncandidate ranking side, an unnormalized language model is proposed, which\neffectively captures deep semantics of queries. This approach presents better\nranking performance over state-of-the-art neural ranking methods and reduces\n$\\sim$95\\% latency compared to neural language modeling methods.

When\nthe number of classes is large, classes are usually represented by semantic\nclass prototypes learned automatically from unannotated text collections. This\ntypically leads to much lower performances than with manually designed semantic\nprototypes such as attributes. While most ZSL works focus on the visual aspect\nand reuse standard semantic prototypes learned from generic text collections,\nwe focus on the problem of semantic class prototype design for large scale ZSL.\nMore specifically, we investigate the use of noisy textual metadata associated\nto photos as text collections, as we hypothesize they are likely to provide\nmore plausible semantic embeddings for visual classes if exploited\nappropriately. We thus make use of a source-based voting strategy to improve\nthe robustness of semantic prototypes. Evaluation on the large scale ImageNet\ndataset shows a significant improvement in ZSL performances over two strong\nbaselines, and over usual semantic embeddings used in previous works.

The\nmodel consists of three coupled, nonlinear partial differential equations that\ndescribe spatial density patterns of input and output materials by modifying a\nmediating scalar field, on which supply and drainage networks are carved.

However,\ncurrent methods present two drawbacks. First, they lack precision compared with\noptical tweezers or AFM. Second, the dependence of their signal upon the\nposition is complex creating the need for a time-consuming calibration step.\n  Here, we introduce a new optical technique that circumvents both issues and\nallows for a simple, versatile and efficient 3D tracking of diluted particles\nwhile offering a sub-nanometer frame-to-frame precision in all three spatial\ndirections. The principle is to combine stereoscopy and interferometry, such\nthat the z (axial) position is measured through the distance between two\ninterferometric fringe patterns. The linearity of this stereoscopy technique\nalleviates the need for lookup tables while the structured interferometric\npattern enhances precision. On the other hand, the extended spatial footprint\nof this PSF maximizes the number of photons detected per frame without the need\nof fancy cameras, nor the need for complex hardware. Hence, thanks to its\nsimplicity and versatility, we believe that SDI (Stereo Darkfield\nInterferometry) technology has the potential to significantly enhance the\nspreading of 3D tracking.\n  We demonstrate the efficiency of this technique on various single-molecule\nmeasurements thanks to magnetic tweezers. In particular we demonstrate the\nprecise quantification of two-state dynamics involving axial steps as short as\n1 nm. We then show that SDI can be directly embedded in a commercial objective\nproviding a means to track multiple single cells in 3D .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 22:41:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 19:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

The local structures possess\nlength scales of the same order of magnitude as the pair separation $l$, and\nthey induce strong relative motion between the particle pair.

Moreover, this technique\nenables the joint compensation of impairments not addressed by traditional\nTI-ADC calibration techniques, such as I/Q skew in quadrature modulation\nreceivers. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\ntechnique, and low complexity implementation options are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 00:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

Existing works tend to assume that the same verb has\nsimilar visual characteristics in different HOI categories, an approach that\nignores the diverse semantic meanings of the verb. To address this issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a novel Polysemy Deciphering Network (PD-Net) that\ndecodes the visual polysemy of verbs for HOI detection in three distinct ways.\nFirst, we refine features for HOI detection to be polysemyaware through the use\nof two novel modules: namely, Language Prior-guided Channel Attention (LPCA)\nand Language Prior-based Feature Augmentation (LPFA). LPCA highlights important\nelements in human and object appearance features for each HOI category to be\nidentified; moreover, LPFA augments human pose and spatial features for HOI\ndetection using language priors, enabling the verb classifiers to receive\nlanguage hints that reduce intra-class variation for the same verb. Second, we\nintroduce a novel Polysemy-Aware Modal Fusion module (PAMF), which guides\nPD-Net to make decisions based on feature types deemed more important according\nto the language priors. Third, we propose to relieve the verb polysemy problem\nthrough sharing verb classifiers for semantically similar HOI categories.\nFurthermore, to expedite research on the verb polysemy problem, we build a new\nbenchmark dataset named HOI-VerbPolysemy (HOIVP), which includes common verbs\n(predicates) that have diverse semantic meanings in the real world. Finally,\nthrough deciphering the visual polysemy of verbs, our approach is demonstrated\nto outperform state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on the HICO-DET,\nV-COCO, and HOI-VP databases.

In this paper, we\nfocus on a special family of quantum circuits called the Hamiltonian\nVariational Ansatz (HVA), which takes inspiration from the quantum\napproximation optimization algorithm and adiabatic quantum computation. Through\nthe study of its entanglement spectrum and energy gradient statistics, we find\nthat HVA exhibits favorable structural properties such as mild or entirely\nabsent barren plateaus and a restricted state space that eases their\noptimization in comparison to the well-studied \"hardware-efficient ansatz.\" We\nalso numerically observe that the optimization landscape of HVA becomes almost\ntrap free when the ansatz is over-parameterized. We observe a size-dependent\n\"computational phase transition\" as the number of layers in the HVA circuit is\nincreased where the optimization crosses over from a hard to an easy region in\nterms of the quality of the approximations and speed of convergence to a good\nsolution. In contrast with the analogous transitions observed in the learning\nof random unitaries which occur at a number of layers that grows exponentially\nwith the number of qubits, our Variational Quantum Eigensolver experiments\nsuggest that the threshold to achieve the over-parameterization phenomenon\nscales at most polynomially in the number of qubits for the transverse field\nIsing and XXZ models.

So far,\nthere are two kinds of models for open-domain multi-turn dialog generation:\nhierarchical and non-hierarchical models. Recently, some works have shown that\nthe hierarchical models are better than non-hierarchical models under their\nexperimental settings; meanwhile, some works also demonstrate the opposite\nconclusion. Due to the lack of adequate comparisons, it's not clear which kind\nof models are better in open-domain multi-turn dialog generation. Thus, in this\npaper, we will measure systematically nearly all representative hierarchical\nand non-hierarchical models over the same experimental settings to check which\nkind is better. Through extensive experiments, we have the following three\nimportant conclusions: (1) Nearly all hierarchical models are worse than\nnon-hierarchical models in open-domain multi-turn dialog generation, except for\nthe HRAN model. Through further analysis, the excellent performance of HRAN\nmainly depends on its word-level attention mechanism; (2) The performance of\nother hierarchical models will also obtain a great improvement if integrating\nthe word-level attention mechanism into these models. The modified hierarchical\nmodels even significantly outperform the non-hierarchical models; (3) The\nreason why the word-level attention mechanism is so powerful for hierarchical\nmodels is because it can leverage context information more effectively,\nespecially the fine-grained information. Besides, we have implemented all of\nthe models and already released the codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 02:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

In\nthis paper, we show that a family of regularizers, including weight decay, is\nineffective at penalizing the intrinsic norms of weights for networks with\npositively homogeneous activation functions, such as linear, ReLU and\nmax-pooling functions. As a result of homogeneity, functions specified by the\nnetworks are invariant to the shifting of weight scales between layers. The\nineffective regularizers are sensitive to such shifting and thus poorly\nregularize the model capacity, leading to overfitting. To address this\nshortcoming, we propose an improved regularizer that is invariant to weight\nscale shifting and thus effectively constrains the intrinsic norm of a neural\nnetwork. The derived regularizer is an upper bound for the input gradient of\nthe network so minimizing the improved regularizer also benefits the\nadversarial robustness. Residual connections are also considered and we show\nthat our regularizer also forms an upper bound to input gradients of such a\nresidual network.

To this end, this paper proposes a universal learning scheme\nto get a further 3\\% performance improvement for all state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethods. The major highlight of our method is that we resort the \"motion\nquality\"---a brand new concept, to select a sub-group of video frames from the\noriginal testing set to construct a new training set. The selected frames in\nthis new training set should all contain high-quality motions, in which the\nsalient objects will have large probability to be successfully detected by the\n\"target SOTA method\"---the one we want to improve. Consequently, we can achieve\na significant performance improvement by using this new training set to start a\nnew round of network training. During this new round training, the VSOD results\nof the target SOTA method will be applied as the pseudo training objectives.\nOur novel learning scheme is simple yet effective, and its semi-supervised\nmethodology may have large potential to inspire the VSOD community in the\nfuture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 02:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

Capture into the evection resonance, occurring when the lunar perigee\nprecession period equals one year, could remove the angular momentum excess.\nHowever the appropriate angular momentum removal appears sensitive to the tidal\nmodel and chosen tidal parameters. In this work, we use a constant-time delay\ntidal model to explore the Moon's orbital evolution through evection. We find\nthat exit from formal evection occurs early and that subsequently, the Moon\nenters a quasi-resonance regime, in which evection still regulates the lunar\neccentricity even though the resonance angle is no longer librating. Although\nnot in resonance proper, during quasi-resonance angular momentum is\ncontinuously removed from the Earth-Moon system and transferred to Earth's\nheliocentric orbit. The final angular momentum, set by the timing of\nquasi-resonance escape, is a function of the ratio of tidal strength in the\nMoon and Earth and the absolute rate of tidal dissipation in the Earth. We\nconsider a physically-motivated model for tidal dissipation in the Earth as the\nmantle cools from a molten to a partially molten state. We find that as the\nmantle solidifies, increased terrestrial dissipation drives the Moon out of\nquasi-resonance. For post-impact systems that contain >2 L_EM, final angular\nmomentum values after quasi-resonance escape remain significantly higher than\nthe current Earth-Moon value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 03:03:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

Point cloud\ndata, however, could have arbitrary rotations, especially those acquired from\n3D scanning. Recent works show that it is possible to design point cloud\nconvolutions with rotation invariance property, but such methods generally do\nnot perform as well as translation-invariant only convolution. We found that a\nkey reason is that compared to point coordinates, rotation-invariant features\nconsumed by point cloud convolution are not as distinctive. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel convolution operator that enhances feature\ndistinction by integrating global context information from the input point\ncloud to the convolution. To this end, a globally weighted local reference\nframe is constructed in each point neighborhood in which the local point set is\ndecomposed into bins. Anchor points are generated in each bin to represent\nglobal shape features. A convolution can then be performed to transform the\npoints and anchor features into final rotation-invariant features.

However, in\nmost applications, the success of MOT is severely limited by a lack of\nefficient algorithms. Indeed, MOT in general requires exponential time in the\nnumber of marginals k and their support sizes n. This paper develops a general\ntheory about what \"structure\" makes MOT solvable in poly(n,k) time.\n  We develop a unified algorithmic framework for solving MOT in poly(n,k) time\nby characterizing the \"structure\" that different algorithms require in terms of\nsimple variants of the dual feasibility oracle. This framework has several\nbenefits. First, it enables us to show that the Sinkhorn algorithm, which is\ncurrently the most popular MOT algorithm, requires strictly more structure than\nother algorithms do to solve MOT in poly(n,k) time. Second, our framework makes\nit much simpler to develop poly(n,k) time algorithms for a given MOT problem.\nIn particular, it is necessary and sufficient to (approximately) solve the dual\nfeasibility oracle -- which is much more amenable to standard algorithmic\ntechniques.\n  We illustrate this ease-of-use by developing poly(n,k) time algorithms for\nthree general classes of MOT cost structures: (1) graphical structure; (2)\nset-optimization structure; and (3) low-rank plus sparse structure. For\nstructure (1), we recover the known result that Sinkhorn has poly(n,k) runtime;\nmoreover, we provide the first poly(n,k) time algorithms for computing\nsolutions that are exact and sparse.

However, the representation features could be quite different even\nthey are assigned to the same cluster since softmax function is only sensitive\nto the maximum value. This may result in high intra-class diversities in the\nrepresentation feature space, which will lead to unstable local optimal and\nthus harm the clustering performance. To address this drawback, we proposed\nDeep Robust Clustering (DRC). Different from existing methods, DRC looks into\ndeep clustering from two perspectives of both semantic clustering assignment\nand representation feature, which can increase inter-class diversities and\ndecrease intra-class diversities simultaneously. Furthermore, we summarized a\ngeneral framework that can turn any maximizing mutual information into\nminimizing contrastive loss by investigating the internal relationship between\nmutual information and contrastive learning.

The major reason is due\nto the semantic diversity and mismatch between queries and code snippets. Deep\nlearning models have been proposed to address this challenge. Compared with\napproaches using information retrieval techniques, deep learning models do not\nsuffer from the information loss caused by refining user intention into\nkeywords. However, the performance of previous works is not satisfactory\nbecause they ignore the importance of code structure. When the semantics of\ncode (e.g., identifier names, APIs) are ambiguous, code structure may be the\nonly feature for the model to utilize. In that case, previous works relearn the\nstructural information from lexical tokens of code, which is extremely\ndifficult for a model without any domain knowledge. In this work, we propose\nPSCS, a path-based neural model for semantic code search. Our model encodes\nboth the semantics and structures of code represented by AST paths.

To reduce the architecture\ntraining costs in NAS, one-shot estimators (OSEs) amortize the architecture\ntraining costs by sharing the parameters of one \"supernet\" between all\narchitectures. Recently, zero-shot estimators (ZSEs) that involve no training\nare proposed to further reduce the architecture evaluation cost. Despite the\nhigh efficiency of these estimators, the quality of such estimations has not\nbeen thoroughly studied. In this paper, we conduct an extensive and organized\nassessment of OSEs and ZSEs on five NAS benchmarks: NAS-Bench-101/201/301, and\nNDS ResNet/ResNeXt-A.

There is so far no precise understanding of per-flow reordering\nmetrics nor of the dimensioning of re-sequencing buffers in order to provide\nworst-case guarantees, as required in such networks. First, we show that a\npreviously proposed per-flow metric, reordering late time offset (RTO),\ndetermines the timeout value. If the network is lossless, another previously\ndefined metric, the reordering byte offset (RBO), determines the required\nbuffer. If packet losses cannot be ignored, the required buffer may be larger\nthan RBO, and depends on jitter, an arrival curve of the flow at its source,\nand the timeout. Then we develop a calculus to compute the RTO for a flow path;\nthe method uses a novel relation with jitter and arrival curve, together with a\ndecomposition of the path into non order-preserving and order-preserving\nelements. We also analyse the effect of re-sequencing buffers on worst-case\ndelay, jitter and propagation of arrival curves.

This causes a strong increase in the\nnumber of lattice configurations that have to be generated to obtain\nstatistically significant results. This paper discusses hierarchical sampling\nmethods to tame the growth in autocorrelations. Combined with multilevel\nvariance reduction, this significantly reduces the computational cost of\nsimulations for given tolerances $\\epsilon_{\\text{disc}}$ on the discretisation\nerror and $\\epsilon_{\\text{stat}}$ on the statistical error. For observables\nwith lattice errors of order $\\alpha$ and integrated autocorrelation times that\ngrow like $\\tau_{\\mathrm{int}}\\propto a^{-z}$, multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC)\nreduces the cost from\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon_{\\text{stat}}^{-2}\\epsilon_{\\text{disc}}^{-(1+z)/\\alpha})$\nto $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon_{\\text{stat}}^{-2}\\vert\\log \\epsilon_{\\text{disc}}\n\\vert^2+\\epsilon_{\\text{disc}}^{-1/\\alpha})$ or\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon_{\\text{stat}}^{-2}+\\epsilon_{\\text{disc}}^{-1/\\alpha})$.\nHigher gains are expected for simulations of quantum field theories in $D$\ndimensions. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on two model\nsystems, including a topological oscillator that is badly affected by critical\nslowdown from topological charge freezing. On fine lattices, the new methods\nare orders of magnitude faster than standard Hybrid Monte Carlo sampling. For\nhigh resolutions, MLMC can be used to accelerate even the cluster algorithm for\nthe topological oscillator. Performance is further improved through\nperturbative matching which guarantees efficient coupling of theories on the\nmultilevel hierarchy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 11:10:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 13:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

Although there has been quite some prior\nresearch on the UAV deployment, no work has studied this problem in a 3\ndimensional (3D) setting and taken into account the UAV-BS capacity limit and\nthe quality of service (QoS) requirements of ground users. Therefore, in this\npaper, we focus on the problem of deploying UAV-BSs to provide satisfactory\nwireless communication services, with the aim to maximize the total number of\ncovered user equipment (UE) subject to user data rate requirements and UAV-BSs'\ncapacity limit. First, we model the relationship between the air-to-ground\n(A2G) path loss (PL) and the location of UAV-BSs in both horizontal and\nvertical dimensions which has not been considered in previous works. Unlike the\nconventional UAV deployment problem formulation, the 3D deployment problem is\ndecoupled into a 2D horizontal placement and altitude determination connected\nby path loss requirement and minimization. Then, we propose a novel genetic\nalgorithm (GA) based 2D placement approach in which UAV-BSs are placed to have\nmaximum coverage of the users with consideration of data rate distribution.\nFinally, numerical and simulation results show that the proposed approach has\nenabled a better coverage percentage comparing with other schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 12:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

These systems exhibit phase transitions and exceptional point\nsingularities in their spectra, at which eigen-values and eigen-modes coalesce\nand the overall dimensionality is reduced. Among several peculiar phenomena\nobserved at exceptional points, an especially intriguing property, with\nrelevant practical potential, consists in the inherently enhanced sensitivity\nto small-scale perturbations. So far, however, these principles have been\nimplemented at the expenses of precise fabrication and tuning requirements,\ninvolving tailored nano-structured devices with controlled distributions of\noptical gain and loss.

To solve this problem, cross-domain\nFSL (CDFSL) is proposed very recently to transfer knowledge from general-domain\nbase classes to special-domain novel classes. Existing CDFSL works mostly focus\non transferring between near domains, while rarely consider transferring\nbetween distant domains, which is in practical need as any novel classes could\nappear in real-world applications, and is even more challenging. In this paper,\nwe study a challenging subset of CDFSL where the novel classes are in distant\ndomains from base classes, by revisiting the mid-level features, which are more\ntransferable yet under-explored in main stream FSL work. To boost the\ndiscriminability of mid-level features, we propose a residual-prediction task\nto encourage mid-level features to learn discriminative information of each\nsample. Notably, such mechanism also benefits the in-domain FSL and CDFSL in\nnear domains.

In\norder to avoid structural failure during operation, the maximum number of\nflight cycles and flight hours is regulated by laws ensuring continued\nairworthiness. However, since every flight impacts the aircraft differently,\nnot all airframes are equally stressed at the time of decommissioning. This\npaper proposes a new retirement criterion based on the so-called fatigue damage\nindex (FDI). The criterion takes into account that aircraft are differently\noperated and thus enables an individual decommissioning of aircraft without\ncompromising its safety. Based on aircraft sample data covering 95% of the\nAirbus A320 fleet over two years, the enhanced decommissioning criterion is\nestimated to significantly extend the average aircraft service life. The impact\nvaries within the fleet, depending on the experienced seat load factors, cruise\naltitudes, and taxi times considered for the individual aircraft during\noperation. While seat load factors and flight altitudes significantly affect\nthe defined FDI, the influence of taxi times is only minor. Based on the\nestimated increase in aircraft service life, the paper argues that for service\nlife extensions, the FDI shall be considered as the limit of validity in the\nregulatory framework governing the decommissioning of aircraft.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 12:58:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 07:35:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 05:53:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 10:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-12"}

Similar to other rare-event\nsearches, the materials used in the detector construction are subject to\nstringent radiopurity requirements. The detector features a 140-cm diameter\nproportional counter comprising two hemispheres made from commercially sourced\n99.99% pure copper. Such copper is widely used in rare-event searches because\nit is readily available, there are no long-lived Cu radioisotopes, and levels\nof non-Cu radiocontaminants are generally low. However, measurements performed\nwith a dedicated 210Po alpha counting method using an XIA detector confirmed a\nproblematic concentration of 210Pb in bulk of the copper. To shield the\nproportional counter's active volume, a low-background electroforming method\nwas adapted to the hemispherical shape to grow a 500-$\\mu$m thick layer of\nultra-radiopure copper to the detector's inner surface. In this paper the\nprocess is described, which was prototyped at Pacific Northwest National\nLaboratory (PNNL), USA, and then conducted at full scale in the Laboratoire\nSouterrain de Modane in France.

In this paper, we aim to investigate\nmolecular formation and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) cooling,\nwith a particular focus on CO, the most commonly detected molecule in\nsupernovae. We also aim to determine the dependency of supernova chemistry on\nphysical parameters and the relative sensitivity to rate uncertainties. We\nimplemented a chemical kinetic description of the destruction and formation of\nmolecules into the SN spectral synthesis code SUMO. In addition, selected\nmolecules were coupled into the full NLTE level population framework and, thus,\nwe incorporated molecular NLTE cooling into the temperature equation. We\nproduced a test model of the CO formation in SN 1987A between 150 and 600 days\nand investigated the sensitivity of the resulting molecular masses to the input\nparameters. We find that there is a close inter-dependency between the thermal\nevolution and the amount of CO formed, mainly through an important\ntemperature-sensitive CO destruction process with O+. After a few hundred days,\nCO completely dominates the cooling of the oxygen-carbon zone of the supernova\nwhich, therefore, contributes little optical emission. The uncertainty of the\ncalculated CO mass scales approximately linearly with the typical uncertainty\nfactor for individual rates. We demonstrate how molecular masses can\npotentially be used to constrain various physical parameters of the supernova.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 13:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

To use them as a cosmological probe, a detailed description of\nthe properties of dark matter haloes is required. We characterize how the\ndynamical state of haloes impacts the halo mass function at the high-mass end.\nWe used the dark matter-only MultiDark suite of simulations and the high-mass\nobjects M > 2.7e13 M/h therein. We measured mean relations of concentration,\noffset, and spin as a function of halo mass and redshift. We investigated the\ndistributions around the mean relations. We measured the halo mass function as\na function of offset, spin, and redshift. We formulated a generalized mass\nfunction framework that accounts for the dynamical state of the dark matter\nhaloes. We confirm the discovery of the concentration upturn at high masses and\nprovide a model that predicts the concentration for different values of mass\nand redshift with one single equation. We model the distributions around the\nmean concentration, offset, and spin with modified Schechter functions. The\nconcentration of low-mass haloes shows a faster redshift evolution compared to\nhigh-mass haloes, especially in the high-concentration regime. The offset\nparameter is smaller at low redshift, in agreement with the relaxation of\nstructures at recent times. The peak of its distribution shifts by a factor of\n1.5 from z = 1.4 to z = 0. The individual models are combined into a\ncomprehensive mass function model, as a function of spin and offset. Our model\nrecovers the fiducial mass function with 3% accuracy at redshift 0 and accounts\nfor redshift evolution up to z = 1.5. This approach accounts for the dynamical\nstate of the halo when measuring the halo mass function. It offers a connection\nwith dynamical selection effects in galaxy cluster observations.

However, despite the\npromising results, these approaches do not scale well to large data tensors. In\nthis paper, we focus on addressing the missing data imputation problem for\nlarge-scale spatiotemporal traffic data. To achieve both high accuracy and\nefficiency, we develop a scalable tensor learning model -- Low-Tubal-Rank\nSmoothing Tensor Completion (LSTC-Tubal) -- based on the existing framework of\nLow-Rank Tensor Completion, which is well-suited for spatiotemporal traffic\ndata that is characterized by multidimensional structure of location$\\times$\ntime of day $\\times$ day. In particular, the proposed LSTC-Tubal model involves\na scalable tensor nuclear norm minimization scheme by integrating linear\nunitary transformation. Therefore, tensor nuclear norm minimization can be\nsolved by singular value thresholding on the transformed matrix of each day\nwhile the day-to-day correlation can be effectively preserved by the unitary\ntransform matrix. We compare LSTC-Tubal with state-of-the-art baseline models,\nand find that LSTC-Tubal can achieve competitive accuracy with a significantly\nlower computational cost. In addition, the LSTC-Tubal will also benefit other\ntasks in modeling large-scale spatiotemporal traffic data, such as\nnetwork-level traffic forecasting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 14:19:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 12:58:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2021 17:19:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

However, learning as optimisation fails to account for a time\nvarying environment during the learning process; and the resulting point\nestimate in parameter space does not account for uncertainty. Here, we frame\nlearning as filtering, i.e., a principled method for including time and\nparameter uncertainty. We derive the filtering-based learning rule for a\nspiking neuronal network - the Synaptic Filter - and show its computational and\nbiological relevance. For the computational relevance, we show that filtering\nin combination with Bayesian regression improves performance compared to a\ngradient learning rule with optimal learning rate in terms of weight\nestimation. Furthermore, the filtering-based rule outperforms gradient-based\nrules in the presence of model mismatch, indicating a better generalisation\nperformance. The dynamics of the mean of the Synaptic Filter is consistent with\nthe spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) while the dynamics of the variance\nmakes novel predictions regarding spike-timing dependent changes of EPSP\nvariability.

However,\nlipid bilayers under voltage-clamp conditions do not only display current\ntraces with discrete conduction-steps indistinguishable from those attributed\nto the presence of protein channels. In current-voltage (I-V) plots they may\nalso display outward rectification, i.e., voltage-gating. Surprisingly, this\nhas even been observed in chemically symmetric lipid bilayers. Here, we\ninvestigate this phenomenon using a theoretical framework that models the\nelectrostrictive effect of voltage on lipid membranes in the presence of a\nspontaneous polarization, which can be recognized by a voltage offset in\nelectrical measurements. It can arise from an asymmetry of the membrane, for\nexample from a nonzero spontaneous curvature of the membrane. This curvature\ncan be caused by voltage via the flexoelectric effect, or by hydrostatic\npressure differences across the membrane. Here, we describe I-V relations for\nlipid membranes formed at the tip of patch pipettes situated close to an\naqueous surface. We measured at different depths relative to air/water surface,\nresulting in different pressure gradients across the membrane. Both linear and\nnonlinear I-V profiles were observed. Nonlinear conduction consistently takes\nthe form of outward rectified currents. We explain the conductance properties\nby two mechanisms: One leak current with constant conductance without pores,\nand a second process that is due to voltage-gated pore opening correlating with\nthe appearance of channel-like conduction steps. In some instances, these\nnonlinear I-V relations display a voltage regime in which dI/dV is negative.\nThis has also been previously observed in the presence of sodium channels. ...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 14:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography\n(PSMA-PET) may outperform MRI in GTV detection. However, visual GTV delineation\nunderlies interobserver heterogeneity and is time consuming. The aim of this\nstudy was to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated\nsegmentation of intraprostatic tumour (GTV-CNN) in PSMA-PET.\n  Methods: The CNN (3D U-Net) was trained on [68Ga]PSMA-PET images of 152\npatients from two different institutions and the training labels were generated\nmanually using a validated technique. The CNN was tested on two independent\ninternal (cohort 1: [68Ga]PSMA-PET, n=18 and cohort 2: [18F]PSMA-PET, n=19) and\none external (cohort 3: [68Ga]PSMA-PET, n=20) test-datasets.

In contrast to the\nalready published papers on the topic, we take a top-down approach to 6G. We\npresent a holistic discussion of 6G systems beginning with lifestyle and\nsocietal changes driving the need for next generation networks. This is\nfollowed by a discussion into the technical requirements needed to enable 6G\napplications, based on which we dissect key challenges, as well as\npossibilities for practically realizable system solutions across all layers of\nthe Open Systems Interconnection stack. Since many of the 6G applications will\nneed access to an order-of-magnitude more spectrum, utilization of frequencies\nbetween 100 GHz and 1 THz becomes of paramount importance. As such, the 6G\neco-system will feature a diverse range of frequency bands, ranging from below\n6 GHz up to 1 THz. We comprehensively characterize the limitations that must be\novercome to realize working systems in these bands; and provide a unique\nperspective on the physical, as well as higher layer challenges relating to the\ndesign of next generation core networks, new modulation and coding methods,\nnovel multiple access techniques, antenna arrays, wave propagation,\nradio-frequency transceiver design, as well as real-time signal processing. We\nrigorously discuss the fundamental changes required in the core networks of the\nfuture that serves as a major source of latency for time-sensitive\napplications. While evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of key 6G\ntechnologies, we differentiate what may be achievable over the next decade,\nrelative to what is possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 15:02:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 12:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

The\nLHC multi-stage collimation system is designed to provide protection against\nregular and abnormal losses in order to reduce the risk of quenches of the\nsuperconducting magnets as well as keeping background in the experiments under\ncontrol. Compared to protons, beam collimation in the heavy-ion runs is more\nchallenging despite the lower stored beam energies, because the efficiency of\ncleaning with heavy ions has been observed to be two orders of magnitude worse.\nThis is due to the differences in the interaction mechanisms between the beams\nand the collimators. Ion beams experience fragmentation and electromagnetic\ndissociation at the collimators that result in a substantial flux of\noff-rigidity particles that escape the collimation system. These out-scattered\nnuclei might be lost around the ring, eventually imposing a limit on the\nmaximum achievable stored beam energy. Accurate simulation tools are crucial in\norder to understand and control these losses. A new simulation framework has\nbeen developed for heavy-ion collimation based on the coupling of the Sixtrack\ntracking code and the FLUKA Monte Carlo code that models the electromagnetic\nand nuclear interactions of the heavy-ions with the nuclei of the collimator\nmaterial. In this paper, the new simulation tool is described. Furthermore,\nSixtrack-FLUKA coupling simulations are presented and compared with\nmeasurements done with Pb ions in the LHC. The agreement between simulations\nand measurements is discussed and the results are used to understand and\noptimise losses. The simulation tool is also applied to predict the performance\nof the collimation system for the High-Luminosity LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 15:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

Given their ubiquity, we are concerned with\ndistributed forms of representation (e.g., population codes), whereby patterns\nof ensemble activity in living tissue come to represent the causes of sensory\ninput or data. The active inference framework rests on the Markov blanket\nformalism, which allows us to partition systems of interest, such as biological\nsystems, into internal states, external states, and the blanket (active and\nsensory) states that render internal and external states conditionally\nindependent of each other. In this framework, the representational capacity of\nliving creatures emerges as a consequence of their Markovian structure and\nnonequilibrium dynamics, which together entail a dual-aspect information\ngeometry. This entails a modest representational capacity: internal states have\nan intrinsic information geometry that describes their trajectory over time in\nstate space, as well as an extrinsic information geometry that allows internal\nstates to encode (the parameters of) probabilistic beliefs about (fictive)\nexternal states. Building on this, we describe here how, in an automatic and\nemergent manner, information about stimuli can come to be encoded by groups of\nneurons bound by a Markov blanket; what is known as the neuronal packet\nhypothesis. As a concrete demonstration of this type of emergent\nrepresentation, we present numerical simulations showing that self-organizing\nensembles of active inference agents sharing the right kind of probabilistic\ngenerative model are able to encode recoverable information about a stimulus\narray.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 15:55:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 11:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

We present here a\ntheoretical and experimental study employing this approach in a gain medium\nwhere the disorder arises not from random scattering but rather from the\nmultimodality of a waveguide: an amplifying multimode fiber. The shaping of the\ncore-guided pump prior to its injection affects the complex, speckle-like\npatterns of excitation within the fiber volume. Thus we are offered the\nintriguing prospect of manipulating the spatially heterogeneous gain in a\nsystem where the disorder, albeit highly complex, may be fully understood in\nterms of the discrete eigenmodes of a well-known waveguide.

This is important for space-based networks in\nparticular since transmitting information over long distances - e.g. from\ndirectly from the initial node to the destination node - will result in the\nterminal signal being relatively weak, which is problematic in a high noise\n(disruption-prone) environment since it will likely result in packet\ndegradation or loss unless signal power is increased to compensate.

COOH-CdTe QDs are prepared in aqueous medium and characterized by\nUV-visible, photo luminescence and FTIR spectrometry. Optical response of CdTe\nnanosensor is observed to be time and temperature dependent. A strong\n\"Turn-Off\" fluorescence response of CdTe is observed in presence of all metals\nions ($\\rm{X^{n+}}$). The output of Stern volmer relation, graphical Job's plot\nand FTIR data established the existence of strong 1:1 complexation\n($\\rm{X^{n+}: ^{-}OOC-CdTe)}$ between CdTe and metal ions. CdTe shows its\nefficient sensing ability for $\\rm{Pb^{2+}}$, $\\rm{Cr^{3+}}$ and $\\rm{Cu^{2+}}$\nions up to concentration $\\rm{10^{-14}}$ M which was established by its low\ndetection of limit (LOD)validation. Further, strong appearance of\n$\\frac{F-F_{0}}{F_{0}}$ establishes the better sensing capability of CdTe QDs\nfor $\\rm{Cr^{3+}}$, $\\rm{Pb^{2+}}$, $\\rm{Cu^{2+}}$ ions which are far better\nthan the existing fluorescent sensors available in industry. The proposed\noptical techniques and principal component analysis of sensing were\nsuccessfully applied for testing of dissolved metal ions in real samples like:\npaint, river water, rain water etc which validates the applicability of COOH\nfunctionalized CdTe nanosensor as a effective successful optical sensor for\nwater dissolved metal ions which are responsible for water pollution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 18:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}
