Different from the more common\nenlarged lymph node (LN), GTV$_{LN}$ also includes smaller ones if associated\nwith high positron emission tomography signals and/or any metastasis signs in\nCT. This is a daunting task. In this work, we propose a unified LN appearance\nand inter-LN relationship learning framework to detect the true GTV$_{LN}$.\nThis is motivated by the prior clinical knowledge that LNs form a connected\nlymphatic system, and the spread of cancer cells among LNs often follows\ncertain pathways. Specifically, we first utilize a 3D convolutional neural\nnetwork with ROI-pooling to extract the GTV$_{LN}$'s instance-wise appearance\nfeatures. Next, we introduce a graph neural network to further model the\ninter-LN relationships where the global LN-tumor spatial priors are included in\nthe learning process. This leads to an end-to-end trainable network to detect\nby classifying GTV$_{LN}$.

In this work, we study the propagation of such\ntail radiation for a compact, static, spherically symmetric weak-field (i.e.\nlow density) mass distribution that is well off the line-of-sight (LOS) between\na source and an observer, and that is coupled to the radiation only\ngravitationally. For such perturbers, there are four distinct epochs in the\nobserved radiation: the light-cone piece; the subsequent early-time tail --\nending at the first time that a signal moving at the speed of light could\ntravel from the source to a point in the perturber thence to the observer; the\nsubsequent middle-time tail; and the late-time tail, beginning at the last time\nthat a signal could make such a journey. For massless scalar and vector (eg.\nelectromagnetic radiation), we revisit the previously studied early and\nlate-time tail, and perform the first full examination of the middle-time tail.\nStudying shorter wavelengths and generic perturbers well off the LOS, we find\nthat the late-time tail carries a small fraction of the energy received by the\nobserver; however, the total middle-time tail contains much more energy. We\nalso note that whereas the middle-time tail appears to the observer to emanate\nfrom the perturber -- as one might expect for radiation \"scattered\" from the\ngravitational perturbation -- the late-time tail appears to come back from the\nsource.

Graph\nembedding has been proved extremely useful to learn low-dimensional feature\nrepresentations from graph structured data. These feature representations can\nbe used for a variety of prediction tasks from node classification to link\nprediction. However, existing graph embedding methods do not consider users'\nprivacy to prevent inference attacks. That is, adversaries can infer users'\nsensitive information by analyzing node representations learned from graph\nembedding algorithms. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Privacy Graph\nEmbedding (APGE), a graph adversarial training framework that integrates the\ndisentangling and purging mechanisms to remove users' private information from\nlearned node representations.

Purpose: Our goal is to propose\nan approximate way of decomposing the discretized BUX into components of each\nchannel. This approximation is referred to as the \"probability separation\n(P-separation)\". Method: As an example, we consider $^{11}$Be scattering by\nusing the three-body model with core excitation\n($^{10}\\mathrm{Be}+n+\\mathrm{T}$, where T is a target). The structural part is\nconstructed by the particle-rotor model and the reaction part is described by\nthe distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA). Results: The validity of the\nP-separation is tested by comparing with the exact calculation. The approximate\nway reproduces the exact BUXs well regardless of the configurations and/or the\nresonance positions of $^{11}$Be.

In these settings, we must be careful\nabout the causal interpretation of classical statistical estimands. In\nparticular, estimands on the hazard scale, such as ratios of cause specific or\nsubdistribution hazards, are fundamentally hard to be interpret causally.\nEstimands on the risk scale, such as contrasts of cumulative incidence\nfunctions, do have a causal interpretation, but they only capture the total\neffect of the treatment on the event of interest; that is, effects both through\nand outside of the competing event. To disentangle causal treatment effects on\nthe event of interest and competing events, the separable direct and indirect\neffects were recently introduced. Here we provide new results on the estimation\nof direct and indirect separable effects in continuous time. In particular, we\nderive the nonparametric influence function in continuous time and use it to\nconstruct an estimator that has certain robustness properties. We also propose\na simple estimator based on semiparametric models for the two cause specific\nhazard functions. We describe the asymptotic properties of these estimators,\nand present results from simulation studies, suggesting that the estimators\nbehave satisfactorily in finite samples.

To address\nthis issue, we propose an enhanced TFR and mode decomposition (ETFR-MD) method,\nwhich is particularly adapted to represent and decompose multi-mode signals\nwith close or crossing IFs under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.\nThe emphasis of the proposed ETFR-MD is placed on accurate IF and instantaneous\namplitude (IA) extraction of each signal mode based on short-time Fourier\ntransform (STFT). First, we design an initial IF estimation method specifically\nfor the cases involving crossing IFs. Further, a low-complexity mode\nenhancement scheme is proposed so that enhanced IFs better fit underlying IF\nlaws. Finally, the IA extraction from signal's STFT coefficients combined with\nthe enhanced IFs enables us to reconstruct each signal mode.

The principal take-home\nmessage of the present paper is that dynamical kernels can provide, thanks to\ntheir frequency-dependent nature, additional excitations that can be associated\nto higher-order excitations (such as the infamous double excitations), an\nunappreciated feature of dynamical quantities. We also analyze, for each\nkernel, the appearance of spurious excitations originating from the approximate\nnature of the kernels, as first evidenced by Romaniello.

One can\ntake advantage of this superconvergence property by post-processing techniques\nto enhance the accuracy of the DG solution. A popular class of post-processing\ntechniques to raise the convergence rate from order $k+1$ to order $2k+1$ in\nthe $L^2$ norm is the Smoothness-Increasing Accuracy-Conserving (SIAC)\nfiltering.

To begin with,\nthe authors examine the dynamics of an AO. Due to this symmetric nature, the\nsystem has two neutrally stable elliptic equilibrium points in positive and\nnegative potential-wells. Hence, the unforced system can exhibit both\nsingle-well and double-well periodic oscillations depending on the initial\nconditions. Next, the authors include nonlinear damping into the system. Then,\nthe symmetry of the system is broken instantly and the stability of the two\nelliptic points is altered to result in stable focus and unstable focus in the\npositive and negative potential-wells, respectively. Consequently, the system\nis dual-natured and is either non-dissipative or dissipative, depending on\nlocation in the phase space. Furthermore, when one includes a periodic external\nforcing with suitable parameter values into the nonlinearly damped AO system\nand starts to increase the damping strength, the symmetry of the system is not\nbroken right away, but it occurs after the damping reaches a threshold value.\nAs a result, the system undergoes a transition from double-well chaotic\noscillations to single-well chaos mediated through extreme events (EEs).\nFurthermore, it is found that the large-amplitude oscillations developed in the\nsystem are completely eliminated if one incorporates linear damping into the\nsystem. The numerically calculated results are in good agreement with the\ntheoretically obtained results on the basis of Melnikov's function.

However,\nmatching supply with demand in a renewable-rich system is a difficult task due\nto the intermittent nature of renewable resources (wind, solar, etc.). As a\nresult, Demand Response (DR) programs are an essential part of the modern grid.\nAn efficient DR technique is to devise different pricing schemes that encourage\ncustomers to reduce or shift the electric load. In this paper, we consider a\nmarket model for DR using Block Rate Pricing (BRP) of two blocks. We use a\nutility maximization approach in a competitive market. We show that when\ncustomers are price taking and the utility cost function is quadratic the\nresulting system achieves an equilibrium. Moreover, the equilibrium is unique\nand efficient, which maximizes social welfare. A distributed algorithm is\nproposed to find the optimal pricing of both blocks and the load. Both the\ncustomers and the utility runs the market. The proposed scheme encourages\ncustomers to curtail or shift their load.

A central requirement appearing in relativistic quantum mechanics,\nnamely local commutativity, is analyzed in detail and possible justifications\nare given and discussed. The complexity of the implications of wave function\nreduction in connection with Minkowski space-time are illustrated by a quantum\nmechanical measurement procedure which was proposed by Aharonov and Albert.\nThis procedure and its relativistic implications are explicitly analyzed and\ndiscussed in terms of state evolution. This analysis shows that the usual\nnotion of state evolution fails in relativistic quantum theory. Two possible\nsolutions of this problem are given.
