We prove that the coupling mechanism is\nreciprocal. Such property is exploited to find closed form and accurate\nexpressions of the coupling coefficient, the main factor characterizing the\nsystem performance. Based on such expressions, it is shown that, for wireless\npower transfer (WPT) applications, up sizing the DRs relaxes the need of using\nultra high dielectric constant materials. The nature of interaction is captured\nby the coupling matrix, which shows that the behaviour of the system is\nidentical to the ones studied extensively in the literature when the contained\naqueous solution is replaced by an enclosing cavity. It follows, as in a\ntypical three coupled resonators setting, that when two DRs are inserted in the\naqueous solution a non-bonding mode emerges; hence enabling efficient wireless\npower transfer (WPT) via the opening of an electromagnetic induced transparency\nlike window. Due to the inevitable situations where the DRs are not\nsymmetrically placed inside the solution, the general eigenvalue problem, with\nasymmetrically placed DR inserts is solved and the eigenvectors representing\nthe coupled modes are depicted by vectors in a 3D mathematical space where the\nuncoupled modes represent its basis. Moreover, the strong coupling between the\nDR inserts and the aqueous medium allows the proposed WPT system to tolerate\nintrinsic aqueous solution losses and the presence of extraneous objects.\nAdditionally, the value of the load at maximum efficiency is independent of the\naqueous solution loss tangent, thus tolerating the variation of the medium\nsalinity. The Proposed EIT like scheme can find applications for mid/short\nrange power transfer in/through swimming pools, chemical reactors, fish tanks,\netc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 16:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

Several works on refining the\narchitecture of deep GCN have been proposed, but it is still unknown in theory\nwhether or not these refinements are able to relieve over-smoothing.

Segmentation of lung infections in\ncomputerized tomography (CT) slices could be be used to improve diagnosis and\nunderstanding of COVID-19 in patients. Deep learning systems lack\ninterpretability because of their black box nature. Inspired by human\ncommunication of complex ideas through language, we propose a symbolic\nframework based on emergent languages for the segmentation of COVID-19\ninfections in CT scans of lungs. We model the cooperation between two\nartificial agents - a Sender and a Receiver. These agents synergistically\ncooperate using emergent symbolic language to solve the task of semantic\nsegmentation. Our game theoretic approach is to model the cooperation between\nagents unlike Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The Sender retrieves\ninformation from one of the higher layers of the deep network and generates a\nsymbolic sentence sampled from a categorical distribution of vocabularies. The\nReceiver ingests the stream of symbols and cogenerates the segmentation mask. A\nprivate emergent language is developed that forms the communication channel\nused to describe the task of segmentation of COVID infections. We augment\nexisting state of the art semantic segmentation architectures with our symbolic\ngenerator to form symbolic segmentation models.

While there has been an extensive\namount of work on additive spanners, so far little attention was given to\nweighted graphs. Only very recently [ABSKS20] extended the classical +2\n(respectively, +4) spanners for unweighted graphs of size $O(n^{3/2})$ (resp.,\n$O(n^{7/5})$) to the weighted setting, where the additive error is $+2W$\n(resp., $+4W$). This means that for every pair $u,v$, the additive stretch is\nat most $+2W_{u,v}$, where $W_{u,v}$ is the maximal edge weight on the shortest\n$u-v$ path. In addition, [ABSKS20] showed an algorithm yielding a $+8W_{max}$\nspanner of size $O(n^{4/3})$, here $W_{max}$ is the maximum edge weight in the\nentire graph.\n  In this work we improve the latter result by devising a simple deterministic\nalgorithm for a $+(6+\\varepsilon)W$ spanner for weighted graphs with size\n$O(n^{4/3})$ (for any constant $\\varepsilon>0$), thus nearly matching the\nclassical +6 spanner of size $O(n^{4/3})$ for unweighted graphs.

In this work, we identify a basis collapse issue as a primary\ncause and propose a modified loss function that circumvents this problem. We\nalso provide a few general guidelines relating the choice of activations to\nloss surface roughness and appropriate scaling for designing low-weight dense\nnets.

In this paper, we consider\nweak supervision by means of high-level labels that are not assumed to be\nexplicitly related to the ground truth factors. Such labels, while being easier\nto acquire, can also be used as inductive biases for algorithms to learn more\ninterpretable or alternative disentangled representations. To this end, we\npropose WeLa-VAE, a variational inference framework where observations and\nlabels share the same latent variables, which involves the maximization of a\nmodified variational lower bound and total correlation regularization. Our\nmethod is a generalization of TCVAE, adding only one extra hyperparameter.

They are\nbased on the Yule-Walker scheme modified to account for quantisation. The\nscalar case has been studied before. The main difficulty when going from the\nscalar to the vector case is how to estimate the ratios of the variances of\npairwise components of the VAR model. The first method overcomes this\ndifficulty by requiring the quantisation to be non-symmetric: each component of\nthe VAR model output is replaced by a binary \"zero\" or a binary \"one\" depending\non whether its value is greater than a strictly positive threshold. Different\ncomponents of the VAR model can have different thresholds. As the choice of\nthese thresholds has a strong influence on the performance, this first method\nis best suited for applications where the variance of each time series is\napproximately known prior to choosing the corresponding threshold. The second\nmethod relies instead on symmetric quantisations of not only each component of\nthe VAR model but also on the pairwise differences of the components. These\nadditional measurements are equivalent to a ranking of the instantaneous VAR\nmodel output, from the smallest component to the largest component. This avoids\nthe need for choosing thresholds but requires additional hardware for\nquantising the components in pairs. Numerical simulations show the efficiency\nof both schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 17:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

This may influence the effectiveness of the\nstandard contact tracing procedure for quarantining potentially infected\nindividuals. However, the effects of asymptomatic transmission on the epidemic\nthreshold of epidemic spreading on networks are largely unknown. Here we study\nthe critical percolation transition in a simple epidemic network model in the\npresence of a recursive contact tracing algorithm for instant quarantining. We\nfind that, above a certain fraction of asymptomatic transmission, standard\ncontact tracing loses its ability to suppress spreading below the epidemic\nthreshold.

Often, the magnetic fields\nare determined by measuring the amplitude of the wire vibration under the\naction of a Lorentz force. Though generally adequate, this approach may be\ninconvenient in certain circumstances. One of these occurs when it is necessary\nto measure the amplitude of high-frequency vibration, as the amplitude is\nexpected to decrease linearly with frequency, and thus becomes harder to\nmeasure. Another example may be found in situations where the sensor must\noperate over a wide range of vibration frequencies. In this case the sensor\nwill be unresponsive to specific frequencies of wire vibration, which are\ndetermined by the placement of the sensor. This means that for the instrument\nto be robust, the sensor must be precisely mobile, or multiple sensors must be\nused.\n  Here a technique which may be used to supplement the displacement sensor is\ndescribed.

Second, we combine each unplanned area and its surrounding\ncontext representation as a tuple, and categorize all the tuples into positive\n(well-planned areas) and negative samples (poorly-planned areas). Third, we\ndevelop an adversarial land-use configuration approach, where the surrounding\ncontext representation is fed into a generator to generate a land-use\nconfiguration, and a discriminator learns to distinguish among positive and\nnegative samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 21:15:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 16:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-08"}

We\nargue for continued exploration and interest in the QA framework on the basis\nthat improved coherence times and control capabilities will enable the\nnear-term exploration of several heuristic quantum optimization algorithms that\nhave been introduced in the literature. These continuous-time Hamiltonian\ncomputation algorithms rely on control protocols that are more advanced than\nthose in traditional ground-state QA, while still being considerably simpler\nthan those used in gate-model implementations. The inclusion of coherent\ndiabatic transitions to excited states results in a generalization called\ndiabatic quantum annealing (DQA), which we argue for as the most promising\nroute to quantum enhancement within this framework. Other promising variants of\ntraditional QA include reverse annealing and continuous-time quantum walks, as\nwell as analog analogues of parameterized quantum circuit ansatzes for machine\nlearning. Most of these algorithms have no known (or likely to be discovered)\nefficient classical simulations, and in many cases have promising (but limited)\nearly signs for the possibility of quantum speedups, making them worthy of\nfurther investigation with quantum hardware in the intermediate-scale regime.\nWe argue that all of these protocols can be explored in a state-of-the-art\nmanner by embracing the full range of novel out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics\ngenerated by time-dependent effective transverse-field Ising Hamiltonians that\ncan be natively implemented by, e.g., inductively-coupled flux qubits, both\nexisting and projected at application scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 21:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

Huge investments in building, scientific and technical\nworkforce, equipment and maintenance can be at risk if the increasing light\npollution levels hinder the capability of carrying out the top-level scientific\nobservations for which these key scientific infrastructures were built. In\naddition, light pollution has other negative consequences, as e.g. biodiversity\nendangering and the loss of the starry sky for recreational, touristic, and\ncultural enjoyment. The traditional light pollution mitigation approach is\nbased on imposing conditions on the photometry of individual sources, but the\naggregated effects of all sources in the territory surrounding the\nobservatories are seldom addressed in the regulations.

As a distributed computing paradigm, edge offloading that\nmigrates complex tasks from IoT devices to edge-cloud servers can break through\nthe resource limitation of IoT devices, reduce the computing burden and improve\nthe efficiency of task processing. However, the problem of optimal offloading\ndecision-making is NP-hard, traditional optimization methods are difficult to\nachieve results efficiently. Besides, there are still some shortcomings in\nexisting deep learning methods, e.g., the slow learning speed and the failure\nof the original network parameters when the environment changes. To tackle\nthese challenges, we propose a Deep Meta Reinforcement Learning-based\noffloading (DMRO) algorithm, which combines multiple parallel DNNs with\nQ-learning to make fine-grained offloading decisions. By aggregating the\nperceptive ability of deep learning, the decision-making ability of\nreinforcement learning, and the rapid environment learning ability of\nmeta-learning, it is possible to quickly and flexibly obtain the optimal\noffloading strategy from the IoT environment. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat the proposed algorithm achieves obvious improvement over the Deep\nQ-Learning algorithm and has strong portability in making real-time offloading\ndecisions even in time-varying IoT environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 00:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

A stick-breaking mixture model, such as the\nDirichlet process mixture model, is an appealing construction that assumes\ninfinitely many components, while shrinking the weights of most of the unused\ncomponents to near zero. However, it is well-known that this shrinkage is\ninadequate: even when the component distribution is correctly specified,\nspurious weights appear and give an inconsistent estimate of the number of\nclusters. In this article, we propose a simple solution: when breaking each\nmixture weight stick into two pieces, the length of the second piece is\nmultiplied by a quasi-Bernoulli random variable, taking value one or a small\nconstant close to zero. This effectively creates a soft-truncation and further\nshrinks the unused weights. Asymptotically, we show that as long as this small\nconstant diminishes to zero at a rate faster than $o(1/n^2)$, with $n$ the\nsample size, the posterior distribution will converge to the true number of\nclusters. In comparison, we rigorously explore Dirichlet process mixture models\nusing a concentration parameter that is either constant or rapidly diminishes\nto zero -- both of which lead to inconsistency for the number of clusters. Our\nproposed model is easy to implement, requiring only a small modification of a\nstandard Gibbs sampler for mixture models. In simulations and a data\napplication of clustering brain networks, our proposed method recovers the\nground-truth number of clusters, and leads to a small number of clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 01:13:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 22:18:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 02:19:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 21:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

The mechanical properties of bone have been studied, with\nthe understanding that the isolated microstructure at micro- and nano-scales\ngives rise to superior strength compared to that of whole tissue, and the\ntissue possesses an amplified toughness relative to that of its nanoscale\nconstituents. Nanoscale toughening mechanisms of bone are not adequately\nunderstood at sample dimensions that allow for isolating salient\nmicrostructural features, because of the challenge of performing fracture\nexperiments on small-sized samples.

We study the dynamics of two thermoacoustic oscillators\nsimultaneously subjected to mutual coupling and asymmetric external forcing\nthrough experiments and theoretical modeling. We investigate the forced\nresponse of both identical and non-identical thermoacoustic oscillators for two\ndifferent amplitudes of LCO. Under mutual coupling alone, identical\nthermoacoustic oscillators display the occurrence of partial amplitude death\nand amplitude death, whereas under forcing alone, asynchronous quenching of LCO\nis observed at non-resonant conditions. When the oscillators are simultaneously\nsubjected to mutual coupling and asymmetric forcing, we observe a larger\nparametric region of oscillation quenching than when the two mechanisms are\nutilized individually. This enhancement in the region of oscillation quenching\nis due to the complementary effect of amplitude death and asynchronous\nquenching. However, a forced response of coupled non-identical oscillators\nshows that the effect of forcing is insignificant on synchronization and\nquenching of oscillations in the oscillator which is not directly forced.\nFinally, we qualitatively capture the experimental results using a\nreduced-order theoretical model of two coupled Rijke tubes which are coupled\nthrough dissipative and time-delay coupling and asymmetrically forced.

The dominating reason is that GNN learns node\nrepresentations by aggregating neighbors' information regardless of node types.\nSome work is proposed to alleviate such issue by exploiting relations or\nmeta-path to sample neighbors with distinct categories, then use attention\nmechanism to learn different importance for different categories. However, one\nlimitation is that the learned representations for different types of nodes\nshould own different feature spaces, while all the above work still project\nnode representations into one feature space. Moreover, after exploring massive\nheterogeneous graphs, we identify a fact that multiple nodes with the same type\nalways connect to a node with another type, which reveals the many-to-one\nschema, a.k.a. the hierarchical tree structure. But all the above work cannot\npreserve such tree structure, since the exact multi-hop path correlation from\nneighbors to the target node would be erased through aggregation. Therefore, to\novercome the limitations of the literature, we propose T-GNN, a tree\nstructure-aware graph neural network model for graph representation learning.\nSpecifically, the proposed T-GNN consists of two modules: (1) the integrated\nhierarchical aggregation module and (2) the relational metric learning module.\nThe integrated hierarchical aggregation module aims to preserve the tree\nstructure by combining GNN with Gated Recurrent Unit to integrate the\nhierarchical and sequential neighborhood information on the tree structure to\nnode representations.

Here we consider\na third way to produce these massive stars from the lower-mass stars contained\nin the nuclear stellar cluster which surrounds the supermassive black hole. A\npassing gas cloud can be tidally shredded by the supermassive black hole\nforming an accretion disc around the black hole. Stars embedded within this\naccretion disc will accrete gas from the disc via Bondi-Hoyle accretion, where\nthe accretion rate onto a star, $\\dot{M}_\\star \\propto M_\\star^2$. This\nsuper-exponential growth of accretion can lead to a steep increase in stellar\nmasses, reaching the required 40-50 M$_\\odot$ in some cases.

The evolution of the orbital inclinations and/or their\neccentricities as stars are trapped by the disc, and their orbits are\ncircularised, will increase the number of massive stars produced. Thus\naccretion onto low-mass stars can lead to a top heavy stellar mass function in\nthe Galactic Centre and other galactic nuclei.

Because methods that directly reuse the stored\nexperience data cannot follow the change of the environment in robotic problems\nwith a time-varying environment, online DRL is required. The eligibility traces\nmethod is well known as an online learning technique for improving sample\nefficiency in traditional reinforcement learning with linear regressors rather\nthan DRL. The dependency between parameters of deep neural networks would\ndestroy the eligibility traces, which is why they are not integrated with DRL.\nAlthough replacing the gradient with the most influential one rather than\naccumulating the gradients as the eligibility traces can alleviate this\nproblem, the replacing operation reduces the number of reuses of previous\nexperiences.

When the accumulated gradients differ from those computed using the\nlatest parameters, the proposed method takes into account the divergence\nbetween the past and latest parameters to adaptively decay the eligibility\ntraces.

In addition to this\nrequirement, in many applications, the UAVs require a reliable internet\nconnection during their flights. In this paper, we minimize the travel time of\nthe UAVs, ensuring that a probabilistic connectivity constraint is satisfied.\nTo solve this problem, we need a global model of the outage probability in the\nenvironment. Since the UAVs have different missions and fly over different\nareas, their collected data carry local information on the network's\nconnectivity. As a result, the UAVs can not rely on their own experiences to\nbuild the global model. This issue affects the path planning of the UAVs. To\naddress this concern, we utilize a two-step approach. In the first step, by\nusing Federated Learning (FL), the UAVs collaboratively build a global model of\nthe outage probability in the environment. In the second step, by using the\nglobal model obtained in the first step and rapidly-exploring random trees\n(RRTs), we propose an algorithm to optimize UAVs' paths.

First,\nwe prove that, VBD can significantly decrease the validation loss of\nautoencoders via providing them a huge diversified training data which is the\nkey to reach better generalization to minimize the over-fitting problem.\nSecond, we use the VBD to propose the first projection-based method called\ncross-concatenation to balance the skewed class distributions without\nover-sampling. We prove that, cross-concatenation can solve uncertainty problem\nof data driven methods for imbalanced classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 04:01:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-18"}

In addition to presenting the code itself, we briefly\ndiscuss a number of extensions and provide the code required to implement some\nof these. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of using a gradient-based\nmethod compared to a genetic-algorithm-based method (using MATLAB's ga\nalgorithm) for solving inverse design problems in photonics.
