Interestingly, for all these\nmodels, depending on the statistics, the TUR ratio can be expressed as a sum or\na difference of an universal term which is always greater or equal to 2 and a\ncorresponding entropy production term. We find that the generalized version of\nthe TUR, originating from the universal fluctuation symmetry is always\nsatisfied. However, interestingly, the specialized TUR, a tighter bound, is\nalways satisfied for the coupled harmonic oscillator system obeying\nBose-Einstein statistics. Whereas, for both the coupled qubit, obeying\nFermi-like statistics and the hybrid qubit-oscillator system with mixed\nFermi-Bose statistics, violation of tighter bound is observed in certain\nparameter regimes.

They allow for\na compact representation of joint probability mass functions defined over sets\nof Boolean variables, that are also consistent with the logical constraints\ndefined by the circuit. The probabilities in such a model are usually learned\nfrom a set of observations. This leads to overconfident and prior-dependent\ninferences when data are scarce, unreliable or conflicting. In this work, we\ndevelop the credal sentential decision diagrams, a generalisation of their\nprobabilistic counterpart that allows for replacing the local probabilities\nwith (so-called credal) sets of mass functions. These models induce a joint\ncredal set over the set of Boolean variables, that sharply assigns probability\nzero to states inconsistent with the logical constraints. Three inference\nalgorithms are derived for these models, these allow to compute: (i) the lower\nand upper probabilities of an observation for an arbitrary number of variables;\n(ii) the lower and upper conditional probabilities for the state of a single\nvariable given an observation; (iii) whether or not all the probabilistic\nsentential decision diagrams compatible with the credal specification have the\nsame most probable explanation of a given set of variables given an observation\nof the other variables.

To\naddress this issue, we propose a blur-attention module to dynamically capture\nthe spatially varying features of non-uniform blurred images.

While popular, we show that SMPL has\nseveral limitations and introduce STAR, which is quantitatively and\nqualitatively superior to SMPL. First, SMPL has a huge number of parameters\nresulting from its use of global blend shapes. These dense pose-corrective\noffsets relate every vertex on the mesh to all the joints in the kinematic\ntree, capturing spurious long-range correlations. To address this, we define\nper-joint pose correctives and learn the subset of mesh vertices that are\ninfluenced by each joint movement. This sparse formulation results in more\nrealistic deformations and significantly reduces the number of model parameters\nto 20% of SMPL. When trained on the same data as SMPL, STAR generalizes better\ndespite having many fewer parameters. Second, SMPL factors pose-dependent\ndeformations from body shape while, in reality, people with different shapes\ndeform differently. Consequently, we learn shape-dependent pose-corrective\nblend shapes that depend on both body pose and BMI. Third, we show that the\nshape space of SMPL is not rich enough to capture the variation in the human\npopulation. We address this by training STAR with an additional 10,000 scans of\nmale and female subjects, and show that this results in better model\ngeneralization.

Several statistical methods have\nbeen developed to assess election accuracy by manually inspecting randomly\nselected physical ballots.

Until recently, the two have been\nthought of as fundamentally different.\n  We present results that unify and shed light upon 'ballot-polling' RLAs and\nBAs (which only require the ability to sample uniformly at random from all cast\nballot cards) for two-candidate plurality contests, which are building blocks\nfor auditing more complex social choice functions, including some preferential\nvoting systems. We highlight the connections between the methods and explore\ntheir performance.\n  First, building on a previous demonstration of the mathematical equivalence\nof classical and Bayesian approaches, we show that BAs, suitably calibrated,\nare risk-limiting. Second, we compare the efficiency of the methods across a\nwide range of contest sizes and margins, focusing on the distribution of sample\nsizes required to attain a given risk limit.

In this dissertation, I describe the notion of\nmulti-stakeholder recommendation. In particular, I study one of the most\nimportant challenges in recommendation research, popularity bias, from a\nmulti-stakeholder perspective since, as I show later in this dissertation, it\nimpacts different stakeholders in a recommender system. Popularity bias is a\nwell-known phenomenon in recommender systems where popular items are\nrecommended even more frequently than their popularity would warrant,\namplifying long-tail effects already present in many recommendation domains.\nPrior research has examined various approaches for mitigating popularity bias\nand enhancing the recommendation of long-tail items overall. The effectiveness\nof these approaches, however, has not been assessed in multi-stakeholder\nenvironments. In this dissertation, I study the impact of popularity bias in\nrecommender systems from a multi-stakeholder perspective. In addition, I\npropose several algorithms each approaching the popularity bias mitigation from\na different angle and compare their performances using several metrics with\nsome other state-of-the-art approaches in the literature.

Here, we develop the first unsupervised domain adaptation based no\nreference quality assessment method for SCIs, leveraging rich subjective\nratings of the natural images (NIs). In general, it is a non-trivial task to\ndirectly transfer the quality prediction model from NIs to a new type of\ncontent (i.e., SCIs) that holds dramatically different statistical\ncharacteristics. Inspired by the transferability of pair-wise relationship, the\nproposed quality measure operates based on the philosophy of improving the\ntransferability and discriminability simultaneously. In particular, we\nintroduce three types of losses which complementarily and explicitly regularize\nthe feature space of ranking in a progressive manner. Regarding feature\ndiscriminatory capability enhancement, we propose a center based loss to\nrectify the classifier and improve its prediction capability not only for\nsource domain (NI) but also the target domain (SCI). For feature discrepancy\nminimization, the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is imposed on the extracted\nranking features of NIs and SCIs. Furthermore, to further enhance the feature\ndiversity, we introduce the correlation penalization between different feature\ndimensions, leading to the features with lower rank and higher diversity.\nExperiments show that our method can achieve higher performance on different\nsource-target settings based on a light-weight convolution neural network.

However, most state-of-the-art approaches tend to perform poorly\nwhen the training and testing images are on different domains, e.g., source\ndomain and target domain, respectively, due to the spectral variability caused\nby different acquisition conditions. Transfer learning-based methods address\nthis problem by pre-training in the source domain and fine-tuning on the target\ndomain. Nonetheless, a considerable amount of data on the target domain has to\nbe labeled and non-negligible computational resources are required to retrain\nthe whole network.

In this way, the domain discrepancy would be\nlargely reduced such that the model trained on the source domain could be\napplied on the target domain without extra efforts for data labeling or network\nretraining.

Lagrange coded computing (LCC),\nproposed by Yu et al., leverages the well-known Lagrange polynomial to perform\npolynomial evaluation of the dataset in such a scenario in an efficient\nparallel fashion while keeping the privacy of data amidst possible collusion of\nworkers. This solution relies on quantizing the data into a finite field, so\nthat Shamir's secret sharing, as one of its main building blocks, can be\nemployed. Such a solution, however, is not properly scalable with the size of\ndataset, mainly due to computation overflows. To address such a critical issue,\nwe propose a novel extension of LCC to the analog domain, referred to as analog\nLCC (ALCC). All the operations in the proposed ALCC protocol are done over the\ninfinite fields of R/C but for practical implementations floating-point numbers\nare used.

Consequently, a fundamental trade-off\nbetween the accuracy of the outcome of ALCC and its privacy level is observed\nand is numerically evaluated.

Any viable theory for the origin of\nthese close-in, polar planets must explain (1) the observed stellar\nobliquities, (2) the substantial eccentricities, and (3) the existence of\nJovian companions with large mutual inclinations. In this work, we propose a\ntheoretical model that satisfies these requirements without invoking tidal\ndissipation or large primordial inclinations. Instead, tilting is facilitated\nby the protoplanetary disk dispersal during the late stage of planet formation,\ninitiating a process of resonance sweeping and parametric instability. This\nmechanism consists of two steps. First, a nodal secular resonance excites the\ninclination to large values; then, once the inclination reaches a critical\nvalue, a linear eccentric instability is triggered, which detunes the resonance\nand ends inclination growth. The critical inclination is pushed to high values\nby general relativistic precession, making polar orbits an inherently\npost-Newtonian outcome.

In particular, the\nprogenitors of a large fraction of compact object mergers, and Galactic neutron\nstars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) have been stripped off their envelopes by a\nbinary companion. Here, we study the evolution of single and stripped binary\nstars up to core collapse with the stellar evolution code MESA and their final\nfates with a parametric supernova (SN) model. We find that stripped binary\nstars can have systematically different pre-SN structures compared to genuine\nsingle stars and thus also different SN outcomes. The bases of these\ndifferences are already established by the end of core helium burning and are\npreserved up to core collapse. We find a non-monotonic pattern of NS and BH\nformation as a function of CO core mass that is different in single and\nstripped binary stars. In terms of initial masses, single stars of >35 Msun all\nform BHs, while this transition is only at 70 Msun in stripped stars. On\naverage, stripped stars give rise to lower NS and BH masses, higher explosion\nenergies, higher kick velocities and higher nickel yields. Within a simplified\npopulation synthesis model, we show that our results lead to a significant\nreduction of the rates of BH-NS and BH-BH mergers with respect to typical\nassumptions made on NS and BH formation. Therefore, we predict lower detection\nrates of such merger events by, e.g., advanced LIGO than is often considered.\nWe further show how features in the NS-BH mass distribution of single and\nstripped stars relate to the chirp-mass distribution of compact object mergers.\nFurther implications of our findings are discussed with respect to the missing\nred-supergiant problem, a possible mass gap between NSs and BHs, X-ray binaries\nand observationally inferred nickel masses from Type Ib/c and IIP Sne.\n[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 18:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 13:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

Finally, we demonstrate that, in the absence of\nobservational and instrumental uncertainties, these SZ-related statistics can\nbe used to recover most of the underlying IllustrisTNG halo spin bias signal.\nOur analysis represents the first attempt to develop a future observational\nprobe for halo spin bias, bringing forward alternative routes for measuring the\nsecondary bias effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 18:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

There is no approach to study this in utero and\ncorresponding physiological understanding is scarce. New Method: Based on our\nprevious presentation of a stable chronically instrumented unanesthetized fetal\nsheep model, here we describe the surgical instrumentation procedure allowing\nsuccessful implantation of a cervical uni- or bilateral VNS probe with or\nwithout vagotomy. Results: In a cohort of 53 animals, we present the changes in\nblood gas, metabolic, and inflammatory markers during the postoperative period.\nWe detail the design of a VNS probe which also allows recording from the nerve.\nWe also present an example of vagus electroneurogram (VENG) recorded from the\nVNS probe and an analytical approach to the data. Comparison with Existing\nMethods: This method represents the first implementation of VENG/VNS in a large\npregnant mammalian organism. Conclusions: This study describes a new surgical\nprocedure allowing to record and manipulate chronically the vagus nerve\nactivity in an animal model of human pregnancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 18:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

A commonly used figure of merit for readout performance\nis the error rate for binary assignment in a single repetition. However, it is\nknown that this figure of merit is insufficient. Indeed, real-world readout\noutcomes are typically analog instead of binary. Binary assignment therefore\ndiscards important information on the level of confidence in the analog\noutcomes. Here, a generalized figure of merit that fully captures the\ninformation contained in the analog readout outcomes is suggested. This figure\nof merit is the Chernoff information associated with the statistics of the\nanalog readout outcomes in one repetition. Unlike the single-repetition error\nrate, the Chernoff information uniquely determines the asymptotic cumulative\nerror rate for arbitrary readout noise. As a result, non-Gaussian readout noise\ncommon in experiments can be described by effective Gaussian noise with the\nsame Chernoff information. Importantly, it is shown that such a universal\ndescription persists for the small number of repetitions and non-QND\nimperfections relevant to real experiments. Finally, the Chernoff information\nis used to rigorously quantify the amount of information discarded by\nanalog-to-binary conversion.

The analysis of salt solubility in water vapor can be done\nusing the Pitzer-Pabalan model, which is based on the thermodynamic theory of\nimperfect gases. The original Pitzer-Pabalan work demonstrated that one can\nreproduce experimental data for NaCl solubility in vapor. No analysis was\nperformed on the reliability of their original fits, which we believe has\ncontributed to the lack of applications of the Pitzer-Pabalan model despite the\napparent success of the original paper. In this work, we report recent progress\nin developing a rigorous fitting procedure to parameterize the Pitzer-Pabalan\nmodel using experimental data. Specifically, we performed fitting of the\nexperimental results obtained elsewhere for NaCl and CuCl. We investigate the\ndegree of underfitting/overfitting and the sensitivity of the fitting quality\nto variations in the resulting fitting parameters. The results, as represented\nby the thermodynamic parameters describing the energetics of formation of\nsalt-bearing water clusters, were successfully benchmarked against Gaussian 16\nab initio quantum chemistry calculations. The resulting rigorous fitting\nprocedure presented here can now be applied to other systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 19:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-21"}

State-of-the-art mispronunciation\ndetection models use Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for acoustic modeling, and a\nGoodness of Pronunciation (GOP) based algorithm for pronunciation scoring.\n  However, GOP based scoring models have two major limitations: i.e., (i) They\ndepend on forced alignment which splits the speech into phonetic segments and\nindependently use them for scoring, which neglects the transitions between\nphonemes within the segment;\n  (ii) They only focus on phonetic segments, which fails to consider the\ncontext effects across phonemes (such as liaison, omission, incomplete plosive\nsound, etc.).\n  In this work, we propose the Context-aware Goodness of Pronunciation (CaGOP)\nscoring model.

The goal of A/B testing is to estimate the average treatment effects\n(ATE) of a new change, which becomes complicated when users are interacting.\nWhen the important assumption of A/B testing, the Stable Unit Treatment Value\nAssumption (SUTVA), which states that each individual's response is affected by\ntheir own treatment only, is not valid, the classical estimate of the ATE\nusually leads to a wrong conclusion. In this paper, we propose a\ncluster-adaptive network A/B testing procedure, which involves a sequential\ncluster-adaptive randomization and a cluster-adjusted estimator. The\ncluster-adaptive randomization is employed to minimize the cluster-level\nMahalanobis distance within the two treatment groups, so that the variance of\nthe estimate of the ATE can be reduced. In addition, the cluster-adjusted\nestimator is used to eliminate the bias caused by network interference,\nresulting in a consistent estimation for the ATE. Numerical studies suggest our\ncluster-adaptive network A/B testing achieves consistent estimation with higher\nefficiency. An empirical study is conducted based on a real world network to\nillustrate how our method can benefit decision-making in application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 19:42:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-21"}

The biological reason for the\noccurrence of expanded structure in the brain is unclear, but may be because\nexpansion can increase the expressive power of a neural network. In this work,\nwe show that expanding a neural network can improve its generalization\nperformance even in cases in which the expanded structure is pruned after the\nlearning period. To study this setting we use a teacher-student framework where\na perceptron teacher network generates labels which are corrupted with small\namounts of noise. We then train a student network that is structurally matched\nto the teacher and can achieve optimal accuracy if given the teacher's synaptic\nweights. We find that sparse expansion of the input of a student perceptron\nnetwork both increases its capacity and improves the generalization performance\nof the network when learning a noisy rule from a teacher perceptron when these\nexpansions are pruned after learning. We find similar behavior when the\nexpanded units are stochastic and uncorrelated with the input and analyze this\nnetwork in the mean field limit. We show by solving the mean field equations\nthat the generalization error of the stochastic expanded student network\ncontinues to drop as the size of the network increases. The improvement in\ngeneralization performance occurs despite the increased complexity of the\nstudent network relative to the teacher it is trying to learn. We show that\nthis effect is closely related to the addition of slack variables in artificial\nneural networks and suggest possible implications for artificial and biological\nneural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 20:00:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 21:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Pairs are sourced\nnon-locally by photon collisions in zones with weak currents, such as the polar\ncap. Annihilation bremsstrahlung extends to the optical-IR band, where the\nplasma cutoff is located. The upper magnetar atmosphere experiences strong\ncurrent-driven growth of ion-acoustic turbulence, which may limit positron\ndiffusion. Coherent optical-IR emission is bounded near the observed flux by\ninduced scattering. This model accommodates the rapid X-ray brightening of an\nactivating magnetar, concentrated thermal hotspots, and the subdominant thermal\nX-ray emission of some active magnetars. Current injection is ascribed to\ncontinuous magnetic braiding, as seen in the global yielding calculations of\nThompson, Yang & Ortiz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 20:32:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 21:28:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

Although expert sonographers are adept\nat reading US images, MR images which closely resemble anatomical images are\nmuch easier for non-experts to interpret. Thus in this paper we propose to\ngenerate MR-like images directly from clinical US images. In medical image\nanalysis such a capability is potentially useful as well, for instance for\nautomatic US-MRI registration and fusion. The proposed model is end-to-end\ntrainable and self-supervised without any external annotations. Specifically,\nbased on an assumption that the US and MRI data share a similar anatomical\nlatent space, we first utilise a network to extract the shared latent features,\nwhich are then used for MRI synthesis. Since paired data is unavailable for our\nstudy (and rare in practice), pixel-level constraints are infeasible to apply.\nWe instead propose to enforce the distributions to be statistically\nindistinguishable, by adversarial learning in both the image domain and feature\nspace. To regularise the anatomical structures between US and MRI during\nsynthesis, we further propose an adversarial structural constraint. A new\ncross-modal attention technique is proposed to utilise non-local spatial\ninformation, by encouraging multi-modal knowledge fusion and propagation. We\nextend the approach to consider the case where 3D auxiliary information (e.g.,\n3D neighbours and a 3D location index) from volumetric data is also available,\nand show that this improves image synthesis. The proposed approach is evaluated\nquantitatively and qualitatively with comparison to real fetal MR images and\nother approaches to synthesis, demonstrating its feasibility of synthesising\nrealistic MR images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 22:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-21"}

It led to the development of a new approach to\nmatch two optical cluster samples, following an iterative approach to minimize\nincorrect associations. The WaZP cluster finder applied to DES Y1A1 galaxy\nsurvey (1,511 deg2 up to i=23 mag) led to the detection of 60,547 galaxy\nclusters with redshifts 0.05<z<0.9 and richness Ngals>5.

They are fabricated by forming a lattice of pores in graphene.\nDepending on the pore size and pore lattice constant, GNMs can be either\nsemimetallic or semiconducting with a gap large enough (0.5 eV) to be\nconsidered for transistor applications. The fabrication process is bound to\nproduce some structural disorder due to variations in pore sizes. Recent\nelectronic transport measurements in GNM devices (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces\n10, 10362, 2018) show a degradation of their bandgap in devices having\npore-size disorder. It is therefore important to understand the effect of such\nvariability on the electronic properties of semiconducting GNMs. In this work\nwe use the density functional-based tight binding formalism to calculate the\nelectronic properties of GNM structures with different pore sizes, pore\ndensities, and with hydrogen and oxygen pore edge passivations. We find that\nstructural disorder reduces the electronic gap and the carrier group velocity,\nwhich may interpret recent transport measurements in GNM devices. Furthermore\nthe trend of the bandgap with structural disorder is not significantly affected\nby the change in pore edge passivation.

The framework is applied to assess radiation\ndose to radiosensitive organs in CT imaging of individual patients. Method:\nFrom patient CT images, iPhantom segments selected anchor organs (e.g. liver,\nbones, pancreas) using a learning-based model developed for multi-organ CT\nsegmentation. Organs challenging to segment (e.g. intestines) are incorporated\nfrom a matched phantom template, using a diffeomorphic registration model\ndeveloped for multi-organ phantom-voxels. The resulting full-patient phantoms\nare used to assess organ doses during routine CT exams. Result: iPhantom was\nvalidated on both the XCAT (n=50) and an independent clinical (n=10) dataset\nwith similar accuracy. iPhantom precisely predicted all organ locations with\ngood accuracy of Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) >0.6 for anchor organs and\nDSC of 0.3-0.9 for all other organs. iPhantom showed less than 10% dose errors\nfor the majority of organs, which was notably superior to the state-of-the-art\nbaseline method (20-35% dose errors).

To build\nconsensus on pluralistic values and make social choices that consider minority\nopinions, we propose aggregation methods that give weighting to the minority's\npositionality on cardinal cumulative voting. Based on quadratic and linear\nvoting, we formulated three weighted aggregation methods that differ in the\nratio of votes to cumulative points and the weighting of the minority to all\nmembers, and assuming that the distributions of votes follow normal\ndistributions, we calculated the frequency distributions of the aggregation\nresults. We found that minority opinions are more likely to be reflected\nproportionately to the average of the distribution in two of the above three\nmethods. This implies that Sen and Gotoh's idea of considering the social\nposition of unfortunate people on ordinal ranking in the welfare economics, was\nillustrated by weighting the minority's positionality on cardinal voting. In\naddition, it is possible to visualize the number and positionality of the\nminority from the analysis of the aggregation results. These results will be\nuseful to promote mutual understanding between the majority and minority by\ninteractively visualizing the contents of the proposed aggregation methods in\nthe consensus-building process. With the further development of information\ntechnology, the consensus building based on big data will be necessary. We\nrecommend the use of our proposed aggregation methods to make social choices\nfor pluralistic values such as social, environmental, and economic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 03:55:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 03:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

The model is\nbased on the classical Temkin-Ertl mechanism and modified in accordance with\nWolkenstein electronic theory by implementing participation of free electrons\nof the catalyst to change the chemical nature of adsorbed species. Wolkenstein\noriginal theory only applied to semiconductors but by including the d-band\nmodel, the electronic theory can be extended to metals. For both simplified and\nfull reaction mechanisms, including electronic steps, we present a steady-state\nrate equation where the dependence on the Fermi level of the metal creates a\nvolcano-shaped dependence. According to the kinetic model, an increasing Fermi\nlevel of the catalyst, that approaching the antibonding state with adsorbed\nnitrogen molecules, will increase the fraction of neutral nitrogen molecules\nand enhance their the desorption. Concurrently, strong chemisorption of ammonia\nmolecules proceeds easily through participation of additional free catalyst\nelectrons in the adsorbate bond. As a result, the reaction rate is enhanced and\nreaches its maximum value. A further increasing Fermi level of the catalyst\nthat approaches the antibonding state with ammonia molecules will result in a\nsmaller fraction of negatively charged ammonia molecules and less\ndehydrogenation. Concurrently, the desorption of neutral nitrogen molecules\noccurs without impairment. As a result, the reaction rate decreases.

It is shown that the\nstructure of the gaseous flows between the donor and the gainer is due to the\nspatial configuration of the donor magnetic field. Its dipole axis is deviated\nsubstantially from the line joining the centers of the components and is\ninclined to the orbital plane of the binary system; the center of the magnetic\ndipole is displaced from the donor center toward the gainer. The surface around\nthe donor magnetic pole, which is close to the gainer, is a region of an\nadditional matter loss from the donor surface. The effective collision of the\nmagnetized plasma with the accretion disk is enhanced by the fast\ncounter-rotation of this disk, especially in the secondary quadrature phases,\nin which the high-temperature medium and the system of formed accretion flows\nare observed. This concept is demonstrated, primarily, in the obvious\ncorrelations between the phase variability of the donor magnetic field and the\ncorresponding variability of the dynamic and energy characteristics of the\nvarious complex lines. This refers to the behavior of the radial velocity\ncurves of the emission-absorption lines formed in the gaseous structures of\ntype H$\\alpha$, HeI $\\lambda$ 7065, or the variability of their equivalent\nwidth and intensity, and the variability of conventional absorption lines of\nthe donor atmosphere.

Doing so modifies the\nfrequencies of all of the cavity modes, that is, the global dispersion profile,\nwhich may be undesired, for example, in introducing competing nonlinear\nprocesses.Here, we demonstrate a frequency engineering tool, termed multiple\nselective mode splitting (MSMS), that is independent of the global dispersion\nand instead allows targeted and independent control of the frequencies of\nmultiple cavity modes. In particular, we show controllable frequency shifts up\nto 0.8 nm, independent control of the splitting of up to five cavity modes with\noptical quality factors $\\gtrsim 10^5$, and strongly suppressed frequency\nshifts for untargeted modes. The MSMS technique can be broadly applied to a\nwide variety of nonlinear optical processes across different material\nplatforms, and can be used to both selectively enhance processes of interestand\nsuppress competing unwanted processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 06:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

These are mainly based on Eigenvector centrality measure.\nBBGH finds a backbone of the network and picks vertex to be burned greedily\nfrom the vertices of the backbone. ICCH is a shortest path based heuristic and\npicks vertex to burn greedily from best central nodes. The burning number\nproblem on disconnected graphs is harder than on the connected graphs. For\nexample, burning number problem is easy on a path where as it is NP-Hard on\ndisjoint paths. In practice, large networks are generally disconnected and\nmoreover even if the input graph is connected, during the burning process the\ngraph among the unburned vertices may be disconnected. For disconnected graphs,\nordering of the components is crucial. Our CBRH works well on disconnected\ngraphs as it prioritizes the components. All the heuristics have been\nimplemented and tested on several bench-mark networks including large networks\nof size more than $50$K nodes. The experimentation also includes comparison to\nthe approximation algorithms. The advantages of our algorithms are that they\nare much simpler to implement and also several orders faster than the\nheuristics proposed in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 07:32:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-21"}

Yet\nwe currently do not know of a naturally existing biological system that is\ncapable of universal computation, i.e., Turing-equivalent in scope. Generic\nfinite-dimensional dynamical systems (which encompass most models of neural\nnetworks, intracellular signaling cascades, and gene regulatory networks) fall\nshort of universal computation, but are assumed to be capable of explaining\ncognition and development. I present a class of models that bridge two concepts\nfrom distant fields: combinatory logic (or, equivalently, lambda calculus) and\nRNA molecular biology. A set of basic RNA editing rules can make it possible to\ncompute any computable function with identical algorithmic complexity to that\nof Turing machines. The models do not assume extraordinarily complex molecular\nmachinery or any processes that radically differ from what we already know to\noccur in cells. Distinct independent enzymes can mediate each of the rules and\nRNA molecules solve the problem of parenthesis matching through their secondary\nstructure. In the most plausible of these models all of the editing rules can\nbe implemented with merely cleavage and ligation operations at fixed positions\nrelative to predefined motifs. This demonstrates that universal computation is\nwell within the reach of molecular biology. It is therefore reasonable to\nassume that life has evolved - or possibly began with - a universal computer\nthat yet remains to be discovered. The variety of seemingly unrelated\ncomputational problems across many scales can potentially be solved using the\nsame RNA-based computation system. Experimental validation of this theory may\nimmensely impact our understanding of memory, cognition, development, disease,\nevolution, and the early stages of life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 07:38:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 18:19:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 00:12:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 2021 18:31:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

Parameters relating to plasma composition, such as charge states\nand He abundance (\\ahe), may be different for plasmas originating from\ndiffering processes or regions on the Sun. Thus, it is crucial to examine the\nrelationship between in-situ measurements of CME composition and activity on\nthe Sun. We study the CME that erupted on 2014 September 10, in association\nwith an X1.6 flare, by analyzing AIA imaging and IRIS spectroscopic\nobservations and its in-situ signatures detected by Wind and ACE. We find that\nduring the slow expansion and intensity increase of the sigmoid, plasma\ntemperatures of 9 MK, and higher, first appear at the footpoints of the\nsigmoid, associated with chromospheric brightening. Then the high-temperature\nregion extends along the sigmoid. IRIS observations confirm that this extension\nis caused by transportation of hot plasma upflow. Our results show that\nchromospheric material can be heated to 9 MK, and above, by chromospheric\nevaporation at the sigmoid footpoints before flare onset. The heated\nchromospheric material can transport into the sigmoidal structure and supply\nmass to the CME. The aforementioned CME mass supply scenario provides a\nreasonable explanation for the detection of high charge states and elevated\n\\ahe\\ in the associated ICME. The observations also demonstrate that the\nquasi-steady evolution in the precursor phase is dominated by magnetic\nreconnection between the rising flux rope and the overlying magnetic field\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 07:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Both single and binary stars will\nsometimes encounter planetary systems in such crowded environments. Encounter\nrates for binaries may be larger than for single stars, even for binary\nfractions as low as 10-20 per cent. In this work, we investigate scatterings\nbetween a Sun-Jupiter pair and both binary and single stars as in young\nclusters. We first perform a set of simulations of encounters involving wide\nranges of binaries and single stars, finding that wider binaries have larger\ncross sections for the planet's ejection. Secondly, we consider such\nscatterings in a realistic population, drawing parameters for the binaries and\nsingle stars from the observed population. The scattering outcomes are diverse,\nincluding ejection, capture/exchange and collision. The binaries are more\neffective than single stars by a factor of several or more in causing the\nplanet's ejection and collision. Hence, in a cluster, as long as the binary\nfraction is larger than about 10 per cent, the binaries will dominate the\nscatterings in terms of these two outcomes. For an open cluster of a stellar\ndensity 50 pc$^{-3}$, a lifetime 100 Myr and a binary fraction 0.5, we estimate\nthat of the order of 1 per cent of the Jupiters are ejected, 0.1 per cent\ncollide with a star, 0.1 per cent change ownership and 10 per cent of the\nSun-Jupiter pairs acquire a stellar companion during scatterings. These\ncompanions are typically 1000s of au distant and in half of the cases (so 5 per\ncent of all Sun-Jupiter pairs), they can excite the planet's orbit through\nKozai--Lidov mechanism before stripped by later encounters.

The test execution\non multiple real devices with different configurations increase the confidence\nin the implementation of the system under test. Our evaluation shows that the\nused approach produces a high coverage of the parts of the application related\nto user interactions.

How does a low shear stress damage the vessel or aggravate\natherosclerosis? It is a puzzling question. Furthermore, shear stress of veins\nis similar to that of Relatively Vulnerable Zones (RVZ) of arteries, while\nintimal thickening of veins is not obvious as the arteries. There are many\nplaces in arterioles with lower shear stress as the decrease of blood velocity,\nwhile the thickening of arterioles is not as obvious as that of the\nmedium-sized arteries. These issues make it unconvincing for us to explain\natherogenesis with lower shear stress. According to Bernoulli fluid equation\n(P+1/2\\r{ho}v^2+\\r{ho}gh=constant), in a closed pipe full of flowing blood, at\nthe same height, the hydrostatic pressure is inversely proportional to the\nsecond power of blood velocity. At any point of per unit mass of fluid micro\ncluster here, the reduction of 1/2\\r{ho}v^2 would be converted into P.\nTherefore, hydrostatic pressure(P) is inversely proportional to v^2 in a very\nshort distance or in the same transection of the artery.

However, it is a very challenging and severely ill-posed\nproblem. In consequence, even the most accurate state-of-the-art approaches\nhave significant limitations. Purely kinematic formulations on the basis of\nindividual joints or skeletons, and the frequent frame-wise reconstruction in\nstate-of-the-art methods greatly limit 3D accuracy and temporal stability\ncompared to multi-view or marker-based motion capture. Further, captured 3D\nposes are often physically incorrect and biomechanically implausible, or\nexhibit implausible environment interactions (floor penetration, foot skating,\nunnatural body leaning and strong shifting in depth), which is problematic for\nany use case in computer graphics. We, therefore, present PhysCap, the first\nalgorithm for physically plausible, real-time and marker-less human 3D motion\ncapture with a single colour camera at 25 fps.

Social distancing has been proved to be an effective practice to reduce\nthe spread of COVID-19. Against this backdrop, we propose that the surveillance\nrobots can not only monitor but also promote social distancing. Robots can be\nflexibly deployed and they can take precautionary actions to remind people of\npracticing social distancing. In this paper, we introduce a fully autonomous\nsurveillance robot based on a quadruped platform that can promote social\ndistancing in complex urban environments. Specifically, to achieve autonomy, we\nmount multiple cameras and a 3D LiDAR on the legged robot. The robot then uses\nan onboard real-time social distancing detection system to track nearby\npedestrian groups. Next, the robot uses a crowd-aware navigation algorithm to\nmove freely in highly dynamic scenarios. The robot finally uses a crowd-aware\nrouting algorithm to effectively promote social distancing by using\nhuman-friendly verbal cues to send suggestions to over-crowded pedestrians. We\ndemonstrate and validate that our robot can be operated autonomously by\nconducting several experiments in various urban scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 10:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-21"}

Effects of the phase change of the\ninsulator-metal transition material (VO$_2$), the complex many-body interaction\n(MBI) and the host medium relative permittivity on the characteristic effective\nthermal conductivity (ETC) are analyzed. The ETC for VO$_2$ nanoparticle chains\nbelow the transition temperature can be as high as 50 times of that above the\ntransition temperature due to the phase change effect.

For SiC nanoparticle chains, the MBI\neven can double the ETC as compared to those without considering the MBI\neffect. For the dense chains, a strong MBI enhances the ETC due to the strong\ninter-particles couplings.

At high\nenergies, relativistic and spin effects significantly affect the triple\ndifferential cross sections. Our analytical approach which seems exact is\ncompared to some other results in the nonrelativistic regime for asymmetric\ncoplanar geometry.

The second observation was carried out in 2018 using the MU radar and a\nmosaic CMOS camera, Tomo-e Gozen, mounted on the 1.05-m Kiso Schmidt Telescope.\nIn total, 331 simultaneous meteors were detected. The relationship between\nradar cross sections and optical V-band magnitudes was well approximated by a\nlinear function. A transformation function from the radar cross section to the\nV-band magnitude was derived for sporadic meteors. The transformation function\nwas applied to about 150,000 meteors detected by the MU radar in 2009--2015,\nlarge part of which are sporadic, and a luminosity function was derived in the\nmagnitude range of $-1.5$ to $9.5$ mag. The luminosity function was well\napproximated by a single power-law function with the population index of $r =\n3.52{\\pm}0.12$. The present observation indicates that the MU radar has\ncapability to detect interplanetary dust of $10^{-5}$ to $10^{0}$ g in mass as\nmeteors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 12:55:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2021 00:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

Previous works have made progresses on discriminating whether a video\nsequencecontains anomalies. However, most of them fail to accurately localize\nthe anomalous events within videos in the temporal domain. In this paper, we\npropose a Weakly Supervised Anomaly Localization (WSAL) method focusing on\ntemporally localizing anomalous segments within anomalous videos. Inspired by\nthe appearance difference in anomalous videos, the evolution of adjacent\ntemporal segments is evaluated for the localization of anomalous segments. To\nthis end, a high-order context encoding model is proposed to not only extract\nsemantic representations but also measure the dynamic variations so that the\ntemporal context could be effectively utilized. In addition, in order to fully\nutilize the spatial context information, the immediate semantics are directly\nderived from the segment representations. The dynamic variations as well as the\nimmediate semantics, are efficiently aggregated to obtain the final anomaly\nscores. An enhancement strategy is further proposed to deal with noise\ninterference and the absence of localization guidance in anomaly detection.\nMoreover, to facilitate the diversity requirement for anomaly detection\nbenchmarks, we also collect a new traffic anomaly (TAD) dataset which specifies\nin the traffic conditions, differing greatly from the current popular anomaly\ndetection evaluation benchmarks.Extensive experiments are conducted to verify\nthe effectiveness of different components, and our proposed method achieves new\nstate-of-the-art performance on the UCF-Crime and TAD datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 12:58:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 08:14:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 11:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

We\nconsider downlink settings modeled by the interfering broadcast channel (IBC)\nunder no multi-cell cooperation, and the overloaded\nmultiple-input-single-output broadcast channel (MISO-BC) under full multi-cell\ncooperation. We focus on three regimes of interest: the mc-TIN regime, where a\nscheme based on treating inter-cell interference as noise (mc-TIN) was shown to\nbe GDoF optimal for the IBC; the mc-CTIN regime, where the GDoF region\nachievable by mc-TIN is convex without the need for time-sharing; and the\nmc-SLS regime which extends a previously identified regime, where a simple\nlayered superposition (SLS) scheme is optimal for the 3-transmitter-3-user\nMISO-BC, to overloaded cellular-type networks with more users than\ntransmitters. We first show that the optimality of mc-TIN for the IBC extends\nto the entire mc-CTIN regime when CSIT is limited to finite precision. The\nconverse proof of this result relies on a new application of aligned images\nbounds. We then extend the IBC converse proof to the counterpart overloaded\nMISO-BC, obtained by enabling full transmitter cooperation. This, in turn, is\nutilized to show that a multi-cell variant of the SLS scheme is optimal in the\nmc-SLS regime under full multi-cell cooperation, albeit only for 2-cell\nnetworks. The overwhelming combinatorial complexity of the GDoF region stands\nin the way of extending this result to larger networks. Alternatively, we\nappeal to extremal network analysis, recently introduced by Chan et al., and\nstudy the GDoF gain of multi-cell cooperation over mc-TIN in the three regimes\nof interest.

Various optimization sequences exposed to the user are manually\ndesigned by compiler developers. In designing such a sequence developers have\nto choose the set of optimization passes, their parameters and ordering within\na sequence. Resulting sequences usually fall short of achieving optimal runtime\nfor a given source code and may sometimes even degrade the performance when\ncompared to unoptimized version. In this paper, we employ a deep reinforcement\nlearning approach to the phase-ordering problem. Provided with sub-sequences\nconstituting LLVM's O3 sequence, our agent learns to outperform the O3 sequence\non the set of source codes used for training and achieves competitive\nperformance on the validation set, gaining up to 1.32x speedup on\npreviously-unseen programs. Notably, our approach differs from autotuning\nmethods by not depending on one or more test runs of the program for making\nsuccessful optimization decisions. It has no dependence on any dynamic feature,\nbut only on the statically-attainable intermediate representation of the source\ncode.

However, the toxicity of lead\nand its ready solubility in water are concerns for widespread implementation.\nThese challenges, alongside the many successes of the perovskites, have\nmotivated significant efforts across multiple disciplines to find lead-free and\nstable alternatives which could mimic the ability of the perovskites to achieve\nhigh performance with low temperature, facile fabrication methods. This Review\ndiscusses the computational and experimental approaches that have been taken to\ndiscover lead-free perovskite-inspired materials, and the recent successes and\nchallenges in synthesizing these compounds. The atomistic origins of the\nextraordinary performance exhibited by lead-halide perovskites in photovoltaic\ndevices is discussed, alongside the key challenges in engineering such\nhigh-performance in alternative, next-generation materials. Beyond\nphotovoltaics, this Review discusses the impact perovskite-inspired materials\nhave had in spurring efforts to apply new materials in other optoelectronic\napplications, namely light-emitting diodes, photocatalysts, radiation\ndetectors, thin film transistors and memristors.

A linear\neigenvalue stability analysis is employed to quantify stability trends (growth\nrate v. perturbation wavenumber) and growth-rate temporal evolution of tip\nvortices.

In this process, the animal flails its legs, whose\nlateral perturbation eventually leads it to roll to the side to self-right. Our\nprevious work developed a cockroach-inspired robot capable of leg-assisted,\nwinged self-righting, and a robot simulation study revealed that the outcome of\nthis strategy depends sensitively on wing-leg coordination (measured by the\nphase between their motions). Here, we further elucidate why this is the case\nby developing a template to model the complex hybrid dynamics resulting from\ndiscontinuous contact and actuation. We used the template to calculate the\npotential energy barrier that the body must overcome to self-right, mechanical\nenergy contribution by wing pushing and leg flailing, and mechanical energy\ndissipation due to wing-ground collision. The template revealed that wing-leg\ncoordination (phase) strongly affects self-righting outcome by changing\nmechanical energy budget. Well-coordinated appendage motions (good phase)\naccumulate more mechanical energy than poorly-coordinated motions (bad phase),\nthereby better overcoming the potential energy barrier to self-right more\nsuccessfully. Finally, we demonstrated practical use of the template for\npredicting a new control strategy to further increase self-righting performance\nand informing robot design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 14:09:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-21"}

In locomotor control, randomness is typically considered a\nnuisance. For example, during dynamic walking, randomness in stochastic terrain\nleads to metastable dynamics, which must be mitigated to stabilize the system\naround limit cycles. Here, we studied whether randomness in motion is\nbeneficial for strenuous locomotor tasks. Our study used robotic simulation\nmodeling of strenuous, leg-assisted, winged ground self-righting observed in\ncockroaches, in which unusually large randomness in wing and leg motions is\npresent. We developed a simplified simulation robot capable of generating\nsimilar self-righting behavior and varied the randomness level in wing-leg\ncoordination. During each wing opening attempt, the more randomness added to\nthe time delay between wing opening and leg swinging, the more likely it was\nfor the naive robot (which did not know what coordination is best) to\nself-right within a finite time. Wing-leg coordination, measured by the phase\nbetween wing and leg oscillations, had a crucial impact on self-righting\noutcome. Without randomness, periodic wing and leg oscillations often limited\nthe system to visit a few bad phases, leading to failure to escape from the\nmetastable state. With randomness, the system explored phases thoroughly and\nhad a better chance of encountering good phases to self-right. Our study\ncomplements previous work by demonstrating that randomness helps destabilize\nlocomotor systems from being trapped in undesired metastable states, a\nsituation common in strenuous locomotion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 14:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

This\ninference allows us to disentangle the motion from the object property and\ntransfer object properties to a given motion. We collected a large number of\nvideos and 3D skeletal motions of the performing actors using an inertial\nmotion capture device. We analyze similar actions and learn subtle differences\namong them to reveal latent properties of the interacting objects. In\nparticular, we learn to identify the interacting object, by estimating its\nweight, or its fragility or delicacy. Our results clearly demonstrate that the\ninteraction motions and interacting objects are highly correlated and indeed\nrelative object latent properties can be inferred from the 3D skeleton\nsequences alone, leading to new synthesis possibilities for human interaction\nmotions.

Upon analyzing 31 articles from the field of\nbioinformatics, it became apparent that genetic algorithms rarely form a full\napplication, instead they rely on other vital algorithms such as support vector\nmachines.Indeed, support vector machines were the most prevalent algorithms\nused alongside genetic algorithms; however, while the usage of such algorithms\ncontributes to the heavy focus on accuracy by GA programs, it often sidelines\ncomputation times in the process. In fact, most applications employing GAs for\nclassification and feature selectionare nearing or at 100% success rate, and\nthe focus of future GA development should be directed elsewhere.\nPopulation-based searches, like GA, are often combined with other machine\nlearning algorithms. In this scoping review, genetic algorithms combined with\nSupport Vector Machines were found to perform best. The performance metric that\nwas evaluated most often was accuracy. Measuring the accuracy avoids measuring\nthe main weakness of GAs, which is computational time.

In this paper, we study maximizing the network lifetime of\nan energy-harvesting LoRa network. Such a network is characterized by\nheterogeneous recharging capabilities across the nodes that is not taken into\naccount in existing work. We propose a link-layer protocol to achieve a\nlong-lived LoRa network which dynamically enables the nodes with depleting\nbatteries to exploit the superfluous energy of the neighboring nodes with\naffluent batteries by letting a depleting node offload its packets to an\naffluent node. By exploiting the LoRa's capability of adjusting multiple\ntransmission parameters, we enable low-cost offloading by depleting nodes\ninstead of high-cost direct forwarding. Such offloading requires\nsynchronization of wake-up times as well as transmission parameters between the\ntwo nodes which also need to be selected dynamically. The proposed protocol\naddresses these challenges and prolongs the lifetime of a LoRa network through\nthree novel techniques. (1) We propose a lightweight medium access control\nprotocol for peer-to-peer communication to enable packet offloading which\ncircumvents the synchronization overhead between the two nodes. (2) We propose\nan intuitive heuristic method for effective parameter selections for different\nmodes (conventional vs. offloading). (3) We analyze the energy overhead of\noffloading and, based on it, the protocol dynamically selects affluent and\ndepleting nodes while ensuring that an affluent node is not overwhelmed by the\ndepleting ones. Simulations in NS-3 as well as real experiments show that our\nprotocol can increase the network lifetime up to $4$ times while maintaining\nthe same throughput compared to traditional LoRa network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 15:16:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-21"}

A signature of spatially variable\ntidal heating is generally sought in observations of surface heat fluxes or\nvolcanic activity, an exploration complicated by the transient nature of\nvolcanic events. The thickness of the lithosphere is expected to change over\nmuch longer timescales, and so may provide a robust link between surface\nobservations and the tidal heating distribution. To predict long-wavelength\nlithospheric thickness variations, we couple three-dimensional tidal heating\ncalculations to a suite of one-dimensional models of magmatic segregation and\nvolcanic eruption. We find that the lithospheric thickness could either be\ncorrelated with the radially integrated heating rate, or weakly\nanti-correlated. Lithospheric thickness is correlated with radially integrated\nheating rate if magmatic intrusions form at a constant rate in the lithosphere,\nbut is weakly anti-correlated if intrusions form at a rate proportional to the\nflux through volcanic conduits. Utilising a simple isostasy model we show how\nvariations in lithospheric thickness can predict long-wavelength topography.\nThe relationship between lithospheric thickness and topography depends on the\ndifference in chemical density between the lithosphere and mantle. Assuming\nthat this difference is small, we find that long-wavelength topography\nanti-correlates with lithospheric thickness. These results will allow future\nobservations to critically evaluate models for Io's lithospheric structure, and\nenable their use in constraining the distribution of tidal heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 15:18:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 10:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

Continuous dynamical\ndecoupling can protect ensemble qubits from noise while allowing gate\noperations, but it is hindered by the additional noise introduced by the\ndriving. Concatenated continuous driving (CCD) techniques can, in principle,\nmitigate this problem. Here we provide deeper insights into the dynamics under\nCCD, based on Floquet theory, that lead to optimized state protection by\nadjusting driving parameters in the CCD scheme to induce mode evolution\ncontrol. We experimentally demonstrate the improved control by simultaneously\naddressing a dense Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) ensemble with $10^{10}$ spins. We\nachieve an experimental 15-fold improvement in coherence time for an arbitrary,\nunknown state, and a 500-fold improvement for an arbitrary, known state,\ncorresponding to driving the sidebands and the center band of the resulting\nMollow triplet, respectively. We can achieve such coherence time gains by\noptimizing the driving parameters to take into account the noise affecting our\nsystem. By extending the generalized Bloch equation approach to the CCD\nscenario, we identify the noise sources that dominate the decay mechanisms in\nNV ensembles, confirm our model by experimental results, and identify the\ndriving strengths yielding optimal coherence. Our results can be directly used\nto optimize qubit coherence protection under continuous driving and bath\ndriving, and enable applications in robust pulse design and quantum sensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 15:25:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-22"}

For\nthe latter, there are insufficient screening channels available, so that a\nsinglet ground state must be driven by the inter-cluster spin correlations.\nThis classification provides a fundamental answer to the question of why\nferromagnetic correlations between local moments are irrelevant for the spin\ncompensated ground state in dilute impurity models, whereas they compete with\nthe Kondo-scale in dense impurity arrays, without evoking a spin density wave.\nThe low-temperature physics of three examples taken from the literature are\ndeduced from the analytic structure of the mapped model, demonstrating the\npotential power of this approach. NRG calculations are presented for up to five\nsite cluster. We investigate the appearance of frustration induced non-Fermi\nliquid fixed points in the trimer, and demonstrate the existence of several\ncritical points of KT type at which ferromagnetic correlations suppress the\nscreening of an additional effective spin-$1/2$ degree of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 15:36:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 08:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

This paper explores a newly derived instrumental grid\ndepicting the key characteristics underlying APL and UPL as they apply to the\nAILR autonomous levels and offers key insights for the furtherance of these\ncrucial practice-of-law debates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 18:35:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-24"}

Diverse evidence needs to be combined in\na rigorous way: in particular, results of operational testing with other\nevidence from design and verification. Growing use of machine learning in SCSs,\nby precluding most established methods for gaining assurance, makes operational\ntesting even more important for supporting safety and reliability claims.\nObjective: We use Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) as a current example to revisit the\nproblem of demonstrating high reliability. AVs are making their debut on public\nroads: methods for assessing whether an AV is safe enough are urgently needed.\nWe demonstrate how to answer 5 questions that would arise in assessing an AV\ntype, starting with those proposed by a highly-cited study. Method: We apply\nnew theorems extending Conservative Bayesian Inference (CBI), which exploit the\nrigour of Bayesian methods while reducing the risk of involuntary misuse\nassociated with now-common applications of Bayesian inference; we define\nadditional conditions needed for applying these methods to AVs. Results: Prior\nknowledge can bring substantial advantages if the AV design allows strong\nexpectations of safety before road testing. We also show how naive attempts at\nconservative assessment may lead to over-optimism instead; why extrapolating\nthe trend of disengagements is not suitable for safety claims; use of knowledge\nthat an AV has moved to a less stressful environment. Conclusion: While some\nreliability targets will remain too high to be practically verifiable, CBI\nremoves a major source of doubt: it allows use of prior knowledge without\ninducing dangerously optimistic biases. For certain ranges of required\nreliability and prior beliefs, CBI thus supports feasible, sound arguments.\nUseful conservative claims can be derived from limited prior knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 19:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-24"}

The fundamental idea behind the design of most neural networks\nis to learn similarity patterns from data for prediction and inference, which\nlacks the ability of cognitive reasoning. However, the concrete ability of\nreasoning is critical to many theoretical and practical problems. On the other\nhand, traditional symbolic reasoning methods do well in making logical\ninference, but they are mostly hard rule-based reasoning, which limits their\ngeneralization ability to different tasks since difference tasks may require\ndifferent rules. Both reasoning and generalization ability are important for\nprediction tasks such as recommender systems, where reasoning provides strong\nconnection between user history and target items for accurate prediction, and\ngeneralization helps the model to draw a robust user portrait over noisy\ninputs.\n  In this paper, we propose Logic-Integrated Neural Network (LINN) to integrate\nthe power of deep learning and logic reasoning. LINN is a dynamic neural\narchitecture that builds the computational graph according to input logical\nexpressions. It learns basic logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT as neural\nmodules, and conducts propositional logical reasoning through the network for\ninference. Experiments on theoretical task show that LINN achieves significant\nperformance on solving logical equations and variables.

This sparked a plethora of\ninvestigations into diagnostics and vaccination for SARS-CoV-2, as well as\ntreatments for COVID-19. Since COVID-19 is a severe disease associated with a\nhigh mortality, clinical trials in this disease should be monitored by a data\nmonitoring committee (DMC), also known as data safety monitoring board (DSMB).\nDMCs in this indication face a number of challenges including fast recruitment\nrequiring an unusually high frequency of safety reviews, more frequent use of\ncomplex designs and virtually no prior experience with the disease. In this\npaper, we provide a perspective on the work of DMCs for clinical trials of\ntreatments for COVID-19. More specifically, we discuss organizational aspects\nof setting up and running DMCs for COVID-19 trials, in particular for trials\nwith more complex designs such as platform trials or adaptive designs.\nFurthermore, statistical aspects of monitoring clinical trials of treatments\nfor COVID-19 are considered. Some recommendations are made regarding the\npresentation of the data, stopping rules for safety monitoring and the use of\nexternal data. The proposed stopping boundaries are assessed in a simulation\nstudy motivated by clinical trials in COVID-19.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 08:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

The\nspread and removal of aerosol particles generated from dental procedures in a\ndental office are measured near the source and at the corner of the office.

However, the sparse and large feature space requires exhaustive search\nto identify effective crosses. Deep & Cross Network (DCN) was proposed to\nautomatically and efficiently learn bounded-degree predictive feature\ninteractions. Unfortunately, in models that serve web-scale traffic with\nbillions of training examples, DCN showed limited expressiveness in its cross\nnetwork at learning more predictive feature interactions. Despite significant\nresearch progress made, many deep learning models in production still rely on\ntraditional feed-forward neural networks to learn feature crosses\ninefficiently.\n  In light of the pros/cons of DCN and existing feature interaction learning\napproaches, we propose an improved framework DCN-V2 to make DCN more practical\nin large-scale industrial settings. In a comprehensive experimental study with\nextensive hyper-parameter search and model tuning, we observed that DCN-V2\napproaches outperform all the state-of-the-art algorithms on popular benchmark\ndatasets. The improved DCN-V2 is more expressive yet remains cost efficient at\nfeature interaction learning, especially when coupled with a mixture of\nlow-rank architecture.

A cross-utterance LM (CULM) is proposed in this paper, which\naugments the input to a standard long short-term memory (LSTM) LM with a\ncontext vector derived from past and future utterances using an extraction\nnetwork. The extraction network uses another LSTM to encode surrounding\nutterances into vectors which are integrated into a context vector using either\na projection of LSTM final hidden states, or a multi-head self-attentive layer.\nIn addition, an acoustic error sampling technique is proposed to reduce the\nmismatch between training and test-time.
