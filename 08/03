The\ntarget lakes are: St. Moritz, Silvaplana, Sils, Sihl, Greifen and Aegeri,\nwhereby only the first four were mainly frozen during the observation period\nand thus processed. The observation period was mainly the winter 2016-17.\nDuring the project, various approaches were developed, implemented, tested and\ncompared. Firstly, low spatial resolution (250 - 1000 m) but high temporal\nresolution (1 day) satellite images from the optical sensors MODIS and VIIRS\nwere used. Secondly, and as a pilot project, the use of existing public Webcams\nwas investigated for (a) validation of results from satellite data, and (b)\nindependent estimation of lake ice, especially for small lakes like St. Moritz,\nthat could not be possibly monitored in the satellite images. Thirdly, in-situ\nmeasurements were made in order to characterize the development of the\ntemperature profiles and partly pressure before freezing and under the\nice-cover until melting.

The work is motivated by the fact that, as demonstrated\nrecently by the authors [1-3], the RVM framework can be derived as an effective\ngravitational field theory stemming from underlying microscopic (critical)\nstring theory models with gravitational anomalies, involving condensation of\nprimordial gravitational waves. Although believed to be a classical scalar\nfield description, not representing a fully fledged quantum field, nonetheless\nwe show here that the vacuumon potential satisfies certain Swampland criteria\nfor the relevant regime of parameters and field range. We link the criteria to\nthe Gibbons-Hawking entropy that has been argued to characterise the RVM during\nthe de Sitter phase. These results imply that the vacuumon may, after all,\nadmit under certain conditions, a r\\^ole as a quantum field during the\ninflationary (almost de Sitter) phase of the running vacuum. The conventional\nslow-roll interpretation of this field, however, fails just because it\nsatisfies the Swampland criteria. The RVM effective theory derived from the\nlow-energy effective action of string theory does, however, successfully\ndescribe inflation thanks to the $\\sim H^4$ terms induced by the gravitational\nanomalous condensates. In addition, the stringy version of the RVM involves the\nKalb-Ramond (KR) axion field, which, in contrast to the vacuumon, does\nperfectly satisfy the slow-roll condition.

The dataset has 12,490 samples, split across 5 classes;\nNormal, Profanity, Trolling, Derogatory and Hate Speech. It encompasses content\nfrom Twitter, Reddit and Wikipedia Talk Pages. Models trained on our dataset\nshow appreciable performance without any significant hyperparameter tuning and\ncan potentially learn meaningful linguistic information effectively. We find\nthat these models are sensitive to data ablation which suggests that the\ndataset is largely devoid of spurious statistical artefacts that could\notherwise distract and confuse classification models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2020 17:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

However, for each pixel in an HSI, it is not only related\nto its nearby pixels but also has connections to pixels far away from itself.\nTherefore, to incorporate the long-range contextual information, a deep fully\nconvolutional network (FCN) with an efficient non-local module, named ENL-FCN,\nis proposed for HSI classification. In the proposed framework, a deep FCN\nconsiders an entire HSI as input and extracts spectral-spatial information in a\nlocal receptive field. The efficient non-local module is embedded in the\nnetwork as a learning unit to capture the long-range contextual information.\nDifferent from the traditional non-local neural networks, the long-range\ncontextual information is extracted in a specially designed criss-cross path\nfor computation efficiency. Furthermore, by using a recurrent operation, each\npixel's response is aggregated from all pixels of HSI. The benefits of our\nproposed ENL-FCN are threefold: 1) the long-range contextual information is\nincorporated effectively, 2) the efficient module can be freely embedded in a\ndeep neural network in a plug-and-play fashion, and 3) it has much fewer\nlearning parameters and requires less computational resources. The experiments\nconducted on three popular HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieves state-of-the-art classification performance with lower computational\ncost in comparison with several leading deep neural networks for HSI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2020 19:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

To this end, this paper leverages the power of edge computing to\naddress these challenges by processing the video streams from existing dashcams\nonboard in a real-time manner. We design a multi-thread system architecture\nthat operates on edge devices and model the bounding boxes generated by object\ndetection and tracking in linear complexity.

In particular, Robertson and Seymour (1983) proved that\nfor every tree~$T$, the class of graphs that do not contain $T$ as a minor has\nbounded path-width. For the pivot-minor relation, rank-width and linear\nrank-width take over the role from tree-width and path-width. As such, it is\nnatural to examine if for every tree~$T$, the class of graphs that do not\ncontain $T$ as a pivot-minor has bounded linear rank-width. We first prove that\nthis statement is false whenever $T$ is a tree that is not a caterpillar. We\nconjecture that the statement is true if $T$ is a caterpillar. We are also able\nto give partial confirmation of this conjecture by proving: (1) for every tree\n$T$, the class of $T$-pivot-minor-free distance-hereditary graphs has bounded\nlinear rank-width if and only if $T$ is a caterpillar; (2) for every\ncaterpillar $T$ on at most four vertices, the class of $T$-pivot-minor-free\ngraphs has bounded linear rank-width. To prove our second result, we only need\nto consider $T=P_4$ and $T=K_{1,3}$, but we follow a general strategy: first we\nshow that the class of $T$-pivot-minor-free graphs is contained in some class\nof $(H_1,H_2)$-free graphs, which we then show to have bounded linear\nrank-width.

One of the best methods of detecting COVID-19 is from radiological\nimages, namely X-rays and Computed Tomography or CT scan images. Many companies\nand educational organizations have come together during this crisis and created\nvarious Deep Learning models for the effective diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest\nradiography images. For example, the University of Waterloo, along with Darwin\nAI, has designed its Deep Learning model COVID-Net and created a dataset called\nCOVIDx, consisting of 13,975 images. In this study, COGNEXs Deep Learning\nSoftware-VisionPro Deep Learning is used to classify these Chest X-rays from\nthe COVIDx dataset. The results are compared with the results of COVID-Net and\nvarious other state of the art Deep Learning models from the open-source\ncommunity. Deep Learning tools are often referred to as black boxes because\nhumans cannot interpret how or why a model is classifying an image into a\nparticular class. This problem is addressed by testing VisionPro Deep Learning\nwith two settings, firstly by selecting the entire image, that is, selecting\nthe entire image as the Region of Interest-ROI, and secondly by segmenting the\nlungs in the first step, and then doing the classification step on the\nsegmented lungs only, instead of using the entire image. VisionPro Deep\nLearning results-on the entire image as the ROI it achieves an overall F-score\nof 94.0 percent, and on the segmented lungs, it gets an F-score of 95.3\npercent, which is at par or better than COVID-Net and other state of the art\nopen-source Deep Learning models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 00:42:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 12:43:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 13:10:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 12:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-15"}

While our method is\nrooted in the well known Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, we overcome\nthe notorious problem of slow mixing by a new idea for generating a random\nsample from among the independent sets. A key tool that enables the result is a\nsolution to a novel sampling task that we call Subset Sampling. In its basic\nform, a stationary sample is given from the (exponentially large) state space\nof a Markov chain, as input, and we want to transform it into another\nstationary sample that is conditioned on falling into a given subset, which is\nstill exponentially large. In general, Subset Sampling can be both harder and\neasier than stationary sampling from a Markov chain. It can be harder, due to\nthe conditioning on a subset, which may have more complex structure than the\noriginal state space. But it may also be easier, since a stationary sample is\nalready given, which, in a sense, already encompasses \"most of the hardness\" of\nsuch sampling tasks, being already in the stationary distribution, which is\nhard to reach in a slowly mixing chain. We show that it is possible to\nefficiently balance the two sides: we can capitalize on already having a\nstationary sample from the original space, so that the complexity of confining\nit to a subset is mitigated.

We further\nshow that when the finite population is large, conventional standard errors are\nvalid but typically conservative estimates of the variance of the estimator\nover the randomization distribution. An interesting feature of our framework is\nthat conventional standard errors tend to become more conservative when\ntreatment probabilities vary across units.

Experiments on two expressive\ncorpora show that our approach can produce more natural speech with much richer\nprosodic variations, and weighted aggregation is more superior in modeling\nexpressivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 02:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

The idea of an effective theory is applied to a system of collinear\nmodes with large rapidity and soft modes with small rapidity. The\nlarge-rapidity (collinear) modes are integrated out to obtain the effective\ntheory for the small-rapidity (soft) modes. The full SCET with the collinear\nand soft modes should be matched onto the soft theory at the rapidity boundary,\nand the matching procedure becomes exactly the zero-bin subtraction. The\nlarge-rapidity region is out of reach for the soft mode, which results in the\nrapidity divergence. The rapidity divergence in the collinear sector comes from\nthe zero-bin subtraction, which ensures the cancellation of the rapidity\ndivergences from the soft and collinear sectors. In order to treat the rapidity\ndivergence, we construct the rapidity regulators consistently for all the\nmodes. They are generalized by assigning independent rapidity scales for\ndifferent collinear directions. The soft regulator incorporates the correct\ndirectional dependence when the innate collinear directions are not\nback-to-back, which is discussed in the $N$-jet operator.

Fisher information is widely used to quantify coding\nprecision and specify optimal codes, because of its relationship to mean\nsquared error (MSE) under certain assumptions. When neural firing is sparse,\nhowever, optimizing Fisher information can result in codes that are highly\nsub-optimal in terms of MSE.

Traditionally, ghost imaging retrieves the image of an object\noffline, by correlating measured light intensities and applied illuminating\npatterns. Here we present a feedback-based approach for online updating of the\nimaging result that can bypass post-processing, termed self-evolving ghost\nimaging (SEGI). We introduce a genetic algorithm to optimize the illumination\npatterns in real-time to match the objects shape according to the measured\ntotal light intensity.

Our study is motivated by the GIGAQBX FMM, an algorithm for the\nfast, high-order accurate evaluation of layer potentials near and on the source\nlayer.

The approach presented in this article uses intonation\npatterns and hybrid residual and bidirectional LSTM networks to learn acoustic\nembeddings with no additional linguistic information. Results of the\nexperiments show that intonation patterns for Arabic dialects provide\nsufficient information to achieve state-of-the-art results on the VarDial 17\nADI dataset, outperforming single-feature systems. The pipeline presented is\nrobust to data sparsity, in contrast to other deep learning approaches that\nrequire large quantities of data. We conjecture on the importance of sufficient\ninformation as a criterion for optimality in a deep learning ADI task, and more\ngenerally, its application to acoustic modeling problems.

Despite their remarkable performance\nimprovements, end-to-end models typically require expensive computational cost\nto show successful performance. To reduce this computational burden, knowledge\ndistillation (KD), which is a popular model compression method, has been used\nto transfer knowledge from a deep and complex model (teacher) to a shallower\nand simpler model (student). Previous KD approaches have commonly designed the\narchitecture of the student model by reducing the width per layer or the number\nof layers of the teacher model. This structural reduction scheme might limit\nthe flexibility of model selection since the student model structure should be\nsimilar to that of the given teacher. To cope with this limitation, we propose\na new KD method for end-to-end speech recognition, namely TutorNet, that can\ntransfer knowledge across different types of neural networks at the hidden\nrepresentation-level as well as the output-level. For concrete realizations, we\nfirstly apply representation-level knowledge distillation (RKD) during the\ninitialization step, and then apply the softmax-level knowledge distillation\n(SKD) combined with the original task learning. When the student is trained\nwith RKD, we make use of frame weighting that points out the frames to which\nthe teacher model pays more attention. Through a number of experiments on\nLibriSpeech dataset, it is verified that the proposed method not only distills\nthe knowledge between networks with different topologies but also significantly\ncontributes to improving the word error rate (WER) performance of the distilled\nstudent. Interestingly, TutorNet allows the student model to surpass its\nteacher's performance in some particular cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 06:44:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 01:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

In earlier work, we have\nshown that fast-convolution (FC) processing is a very flexible and efficient\ntool for filtered-OFDM signal generation and receiver-side subband filtering,\ne.g., for the mixed-numerology scenarios of the 5G-NR. FC filtering\napproximates linear convolution through effective fast Fourier transform\n(FFT)-based circular convolutions using partly overlapping processing blocks.\nHowever, with the continuous overlap-and-save and overlap-and-add processing\nmodels with fixed block-size and fixed overlap, the FC-processing blocks cannot\nbe aligned with all OFDM symbols of a transmission frame. Furthermore, 5G-NR\nnumerology does not allow to use transform lengths shorter than 128 because\nthis would lead to non-integer cyclic prefix (CP) lengths. In this article, we\npresent new FC-processing schemes which solve the mentioned limitations. These\nschemes are based on dynamically adjusting the overlap periods and\nextrapolating the CP samples, which make it possible to align the FC blocks\nwith each OFDM symbol, even in case of variable CP lengths. This reduces\ncomplexity and latency, e.g., in mini-slot transmissions and, as an example,\nallows to use 16-point transforms in case of a 12-subcarrier-wide subband\nallocation, greatly reducing the implementation complexity. On the receiver\nside, the proposed scheme makes it possible to effectively combine cascaded\ninverse and forward FFT units in FC-filtered OFDM processing. Transform\ndecomposition is used to simplify these computations. Very extensive set of\nnumerical results is also provided, in terms of radio-link performance and\nassociated processing complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 06:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

Analyses from this perspective of experimental and clinical\nobservations revealed the pivotal role of human stem cell-associated retroviral\nsequences (SCARS) in the origin and pathophysiology of clinically-lethal\nmalignancies. SCARS represent evolutionary- and biologically-related family of\ngenomic regulatory sequences, the principal physiological function of which is\nto create and maintain the stemness phenotype during human preimplantation\nembryogenesis.

It is still challenging because\nambiguity often occurs when the spacing between characters is large or the\ncharacters are evenly spread in multiple rows and columns, making many visually\nplausible groupings of the characters (e.g. \"BERLIN\" is incorrectly detected as\n\"BERL\" and \"IN\" in Fig. 1(c)). Unlike previous works that merely employed\nvisual features for text detection, this work proposes a novel text spotter,\nnamed Ambiguity Eliminating Text Spotter (AE TextSpotter), which learns both\nvisual and linguistic features to significantly reduce ambiguity in text\ndetection. The proposed AE TextSpotter has three important benefits. 1) The\nlinguistic representation is learned together with the visual representation in\na framework. To our knowledge, it is the first time to improve text detection\nby using a language model. 2) A carefully designed language module is utilized\nto reduce the detection confidence of incorrect text lines, making them easily\npruned in the detection stage. 3) Extensive experiments show that AE\nTextSpotter outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

It is known that even if the network corresponds to a\nunique solution, no polynomial-time algorithm can solve this problem in the\nworst case, unless RP = NP. So we are interested in algorithms that efficiently\nlocalize the network partially. A widely used technique that can efficiently\nlocalize a uniquely localizable portion of the network is trilateration:\nstarting from three anchors (nodes with known positions), nodes having at least\nthree localized neighbors are sequentially localized. However, the performance\nof trilateration can substantially differ for different choices of the initial\nthree anchors. In this paper, we propose a distributed localization scheme with\na theoretical characterization of nodes that are guaranteed to be localized.

Energy is a prime mover in the evolution\nand operation of all biological systems, including vision, and early\nresearchers in physiological optics and experimental psychology regarded vision\nas an energy-driven process. Yet to date there has been little attempt to\nanalyze the fundamentals of vision in energetic terms. This paper is a\nprovisional attempt to sketch an account of the early stages of vision as an\nenergy-driven process. On this account, vision is a form of biological work in\nwhich energy from the environment is absorbed and processed by neurobiological\nsystems in order to guide behaviour. Evidence from the evolution and\nneurobiology of vision is presented in support of this approach.

Nevertheless, current\nsolutions to load balancing in such systems admit a paradoxical behavior in\nwhich more accurate information regarding server queue lengths degrades\nperformance due to herding and detrimental incast effects. Indeed, both in\ntheory and in practice, there is a common doubt regarding the value of\ninformation in the context of multi-dispatcher load balancing. As a result,\nboth researchers and system designers resort to more straightforward solutions,\nsuch as the power-of-two-choices to avoid worst-case scenarios, potentially\nsacrificing overall resource utilization and system performance.

When\nsubject to strong interactions, these systems are susceptible to\nsemimetal-insulator transitions concurrent with spontaneous symmetry breaking.\nSuch quantum critical points are described by effective field theories of\nanisotropic nodal fermions coupled to dynamical order parameter fields. We\nanalyze the universal scaling in the physically relevant spatial dimensions,\ngeneralizing to a large number $N_f$ of fermion flavors for analytic control.\nLandau damping by gapless fermionic excitations gives rise to non-analytic\nself-energy corrections to the bosonic order-parameter propagator that dominate\nthe long-wavelength behavior. We show that perturbative momentum shell RG leads\nto non-universal, cutoff dependent results, as it does not correctly account\nfor this non-analytic structure. In turn, using a completely general soft\ncutoff formulation, we demonstrate that the correct IR scaling of the dressed\nbosonic propagator can be deduced by enforcing that results are independent of\nthe cutoff scheme. Using this soft cutoff approach, we compute the exact\ncritical exponents for anisotropic semi-Dirac fermions $(d_L=1$, $d_Q=1)$ to\nleading order in $1/N_f$, and to all loop orders. Applying the same method to\nrelativistic Dirac fermions, we reproduce the critical exponents obtained by\nother methods, such as conformal bootstrap...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 12:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

Recent works resort to adversarial mechanisms that learn\ndomain-invariant features to mitigate domain shift. However, most of these\nworks focus on holistic feature adaptation, and they ignore local features that\nare more transferable across different datasets. Moreover, local features carry\nmore detailed and discriminative content for expression recognition, and thus\nintegrating local features may enable fine-grained adaptation. In this work, we\npropose a novel Adversarial Graph Representation Adaptation (AGRA) framework\nthat unifies graph representation propagation with adversarial learning for\ncross-domain holistic-local feature co-adaptation. To achieve this, we first\nbuild a graph to correlate holistic and local regions within each domain and\nanother graph to correlate these regions across different domains. Then, we\nlearn the per-class statistical distribution of each domain and extract\nholistic-local features from the input image to initialize the corresponding\ngraph nodes. Finally, we introduce two stacked graph convolution networks to\npropagate holistic-local feature within each domain to explore their\ninteraction and across different domains for holistic-local feature\nco-adaptation. In this way, the AGRA framework can adaptively learn\nfine-grained domain-invariant features and thus facilitate cross-domain\nexpression recognition. We conduct extensive and fair experiments on several\npopular benchmarks and show that the proposed AGRA framework achieves superior\nperformance over previous state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 13:27:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 09:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

The price for satellite images depends on\nthe sensor quality and revisit rate. This work proposes to bridge the gap\nbetween image quality and the price by improving the image quality via\nsuper-resolution (SR). Recently, a number of deep SR techniques have been\nproposed to enhance satellite images. However, none of these methods utilize\nthe region-level context information, giving equal importance to each region in\nthe image. This, along with the fact that most state-of-the-art SR methods are\ncomplex and cumbersome deep models, the time taken to process very large\nsatellite images can be impractically high. We, propose to handle this\nchallenge by designing an SR framework that analyzes the regional information\ncontent on each patch of the low-resolution image and judiciously chooses to\nuse more computationally complex deep models to super-resolve more\nstructure-rich regions on the image, while using less resource-intensive\nnon-deep methods on non-salient regions. Through extensive experiments on a\nlarge satellite image, we show substantial decrease in inference time while\nachieving similar performance to that of existing deep SR methods over several\nevaluation measures like PSNR, MSE and SSIM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 13:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

Numerous such bounds have been proposed, either\nfor classes of theories or (by using general arguments) universally for all\ntheories. Few are exact and inviolable. I present a new set of methods and\nsufficient conditions for deriving exact, rigorous, and sharp bounds on all\ncoefficients of hydrodynamic dispersion relations, including diffusivity and\nthe speed of sound. These general techniques combine analytic properties of\nhydrodynamics and the theory of univalent (complex holomorphic and injective)\nfunctions. Particular attention is devoted to bounds relating transport to\nquantum chaos, which can be established through pole-skipping in theories with\nholographic duals. Examples of such bounds are shown along with holographic\ntheories that can demonstrate the validity of the conditions involved. I also\ndiscuss potential applications of univalence methods to bounds without relation\nto chaos, such as for example the conformal bound on the speed of sound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 14:05:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 13:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-05"}

The advantage of MRI is that it has a high `relative'\nspatial resolution: it can capture not only lingual, labial and jaw motion, but\nalso the velum and the pharyngeal region, which is typically not possible with\nother techniques. In the current paper, we train various DNNs (fully connected,\nconvolutional and recurrent neural networks) for articulatory-to-speech\nconversion, using rtMRI as input, in a speaker-specific way. We use two male\nand two female speakers of the USC-TIMIT articulatory database, each of them\nuttering 460 sentences. We evaluate the results with objective (Normalized MSE\nand MCD) and subjective measures (perceptual test) and show that CNN-LSTM\nnetworks are preferred which take multiple images as input, and achieve MCD\nscores between 2.8-4.5 dB.

First, we redesign the\ndata flow in the critical path by introducing a host-coordinated memory pool\nthat works as a local cache to reduce the latency in the critical path of the\nhost and remote memory orchestration.

Recent\nnumerical simulations have shown that these winds can take either the\ntraditional `hourglass' symmetry about the mid-plane, or a `slanted' symmetry\ndominated by a mid-plane toroidal field of a single sign. The formation of this\nslanted symmetry state has not previously been explained. We use radially local\n1D vertical shearing box simulations to assess the importance of large-scale\nMRI channel modes in influencing the formation and morphologies of these wind\nsolutions. We consider only Ohmic resistivity and explore the effect of\ndifferent magnetisations, with the mid-plane $\\beta$ parameter ranging from\n$10^5$ to $10^2$. We find that our magnetic winds go through three stages of\ndevelopment: cyclic, transitive and steady, with the steady wind taking a\nslanted symmetry profile similar to those observed in local and global\nsimulations. We show that the cycles are driven by periodic excitation of the\n$n=2$ or $3$ MRI channel mode coupled with advective eviction, and that the\ntransition to the steady wind is caused by a much more slowly growing $n=1$\nmode altering the wind structure. Saturation is achieved through a combination\nof advective damping from the strong wind, and suppression of the instability\ndue to a strong toroidal field. A higher disc magnetisation leads to a greater\ntendency towards, and more rapid settling into the slanted symmetry steady\nwind, which may have important implications for mass and flux transport\nprocesses in protoplanetary discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 14:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

Although the literature regularly sets new records\non the number of benchmark bugs that can be fixed, several studies increasingly\nraise concerns about the limitations and biases of state-of-the-art approaches.\nFor example, the correctness of generated patches has been questioned in a\nnumber of studies, while other researchers pointed out that evaluation schemes\nmay be misleading with respect to the processing of fault localization results.\nNevertheless, there is little work addressing the efficiency of patch\ngeneration, with regard to the practicality of program repair.

Our objective is to assess the\nnumber of generated patch candidates, since this information is correlated to\n(1) the strategy to traverse the search space efficiently in order to select\nsensical repair attempts, (2) the strategy to minimize the test effort for\nidentifying a plausible patch, (3) as well as the strategy to prioritize the\ngeneration of a correct patch. To that end, we perform a large-scale empirical\nstudy on the efficiency, in terms of quantity of generated patch candidates of\nthe 16 open-source repair tools for Java programs.

To address these issues, we integrate graph\nrepresentation propagation with adversarial learning for cross-domain\nholistic-local feature co-adaptation by developing a novel adversarial graph\nrepresentation adaptation (AGRA) framework. Specifically, it first builds two\ngraphs to correlate holistic and local regions within each domain and across\ndifferent domains, respectively. Then, it extracts holistic-local features from\nthe input image and uses learnable per-class statistical distributions to\ninitialize the corresponding graph nodes. Finally, two stacked graph\nconvolution networks (GCNs) are adopted to propagate holistic-local features\nwithin each domain to explore their interaction and across different domains\nfor holistic-local feature co-adaptation. We conduct extensive and fair\nevaluations on several popular benchmarks and show that the proposed AGRA\nframework outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 15:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 09:39:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 06:40:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 09:05:32 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2020 03:10:00 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 08:19:33 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 09:59:21 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 06:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

The lightest supersymmetric particles of the\nspectrum are, by construction, two neutralinos and one chargino, almost\ndegenerate, with a mass $\\sim $1.1 TeV, and a mass splitting of a few GeV.\nDepending on the particular scenario the gluino can be at its experimental mass\nlower bound $\\sim$ 2.2 TeV; in the squark sector, the lightest stop can be as\nlight as $\\sim$ 1.3 TeV, and the lightest slepton, the right-handed stau, can\nhave a mass as light as $1.2$ TeV. The lightest neutralino can be found at the\nnext generation of direct dark matter experimental searches. In the most\nfavorable situation, the gluino, with some specific decay channels, could be\nfound at the next run of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and the lightest stop\nat the High-Luminosity LHC run.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 15:33:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 15:45:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

For that reason, it is often\ninvoked as the most relevant constraint to the dynamical evolution of plasmas\nin complex systems, such as solar and stellar dynamos, photospheric flux\nemergence, solar eruptions, and relaxation processes in laboratory plasmas.\nHowever, such studies often indirectly imply that relative magnetic helicity in\na given spatial domain can be algebraically split into the helicity\ncontributions of the composing subvolumes, i.e., that it is an additive\nquantity. A limited number of very specific applications have shown that this\nis not the case. Progress in understanding the non-additivity of relative\nmagnetic helicity requires removal of restrictive assumptions in favour of a\ngeneral formalism that can be used both in theoretical investigations as well\nas in numerical applications. We derive the analytical gauge-invariant\nexpression for the partition of relative magnetic helicity between contiguous\nfinite-volumes, without any assumptions on either the shape of the volumes and\ninterface, or the employed gauge. The non-additivity of relative magnetic\nhelicity in finite volumes is proven in the most general, gauge-invariant\nformalism, and verified numerically. More restrictive assumptions are adopted\nto derive known specific approximations, yielding a unified view of the\nadditivity issue. As an example, the case of a flux rope embedded in a\npotential field shows that the non-additivity term in the partition equation\nis, in general, non-negligible. The relative helicity partition formula can be\napplied to numerical simulations to precisely quantify the effect of\nnon-additivity on global helicity budgets of complex physical processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 15:40:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

For $\\beta_0>0$, the black\nhole forms a remnant with finite temperature, finite mass, and zero local heat\ncapacity in the last stages of evolution, which can be regarded as an\nelementary particle.

The synchronization is\neventually destructed by fluctuations, thus leading to the (pre-demand\nresponse) steady state; however, this natural desynchronization, or relaxation\nto a statistically steady state, is too long. A resolution of this problem\nconsists in measuring the ensemble's instantaneous consumption and using it as\na feedback to stochastic switching of the ensemble's devices between on- and\noff- states. A simplified continuous-time model showed that carefully tuned\nnonlinear feedback results in a fast (super-) relaxation of the ensemble energy\nconsumption. Since both state information and control signals are discrete, the\nactual TCL devices operation is space-time quantized, and this must be\nconsidered for realistic TCL ensemble modelling. Here, assuming that states are\ncharacterized by indoor temperature (quantifying comfort) and air conditioner\nregime (on, off), we construct a discrete model based on the probabilistic\ndescription of state transitions. We demonstrate that super-relaxation holds in\nsuch a more realistic setting, and that while it is stable against randomness\nin the stochastic matrix of the quantized model, it remains sensitive to the\ntime discretization scheme. Aiming to achieve a balance between\nsuper-relaxation and customer's comfort, we analyze the dependence of\nsuper-relaxation on details of the space-time quantization, and provide a\nsimple analytical criterion to avoid undesirable oscillations in consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 10:39:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 14:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

Among\nvarious sources of uncertainty, the variability in the input ground motions,\na.k.a. record-to-record, greatly affects the assessment results. The objective\nof this paper is to quantify the uncertainty in structural response with hybrid\nuncertainty sources. In this paper, multiple matrix completion methods are\nproposed and applied on a case study structure. The matrix completion method is\na means to estimate the analyses results for the entire set of input parameters\nby conducting analysis for only a small subset of analyses. The main\nalgorithmic contributions of our proposed method are twofold. First, we develop\na sampling technique for choosing a subset of representative simulations, which\nallows improving the accuracy of the estimated response. An unsupervised\nmachine learning technique is used for this purpose. Next, the proposed matrix\ncompletion method for uncertainty quantification is further refined by\nincorporating a regression model that is trained on the available partial\nsimulations. The regression model improves the initial sampling as it provides\na rough estimation of the structural responses. Finally, the proposed algorithm\nis applied to a multi-degree-of-freedom system, and the structural responses\n(i.e., displacements and base shear) are estimated. Results show that the\nproposed algorithm can effectively estimate the response from a full set of\nnonlinear simulations by conducting analyses only on a small portion of the\nset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 00:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

(2014). They found that the preferences of the rich correlated\nstrongly with policy outcomes, while the preferences of the general population\ndid not, except via a linkage with rich people's preferences. Their analysis\napplied the tools of classical statistical inference, in particular logistic\nregression. In this paper we analyze the Gilens dataset using the complementary\ntools of Random Forest classifiers (RFs), from Machine Learning. We present two\nprimary findings, concerning respectively prediction and inference: (i) Holdout\ntest sets can be predicted with approximately 70% balanced accuracy by models\nthat consult only the preferences of rich people and a small number of powerful\ninterest groups, as well as policy area labels. These results include\nretrodiction, where models trained on pre-1997 cases predicted \"future\"\n(post-1997) cases. The 20% gain in accuracy over baseline (chance), in this\ndetailed but noisy dataset, indicates the high importance of a few wealthy\nplayers in U.S. policy outcomes, and aligns with a body of research indicating\nthat the U.S. government has significant plutocratic tendencies. (ii) The\nfeature selection methods of RF models identify especially salient subsets of\ninterest groups (economic players). These can be used to further investigate\nthe dynamics of governmental policy making, and also offer an example of the\npotential value of RF feature selection methods for inference on datasets such\nas this.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2020 18:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

The latter requires the evaluation of the expensive\nGaussian log-likelihood function, which has impeded the adoption of\nmultivariate geospatial models for large multivariate spatial datasets.\nHowever, this large-scale cokriging challenge provides a fertile ground for\nsupercomputing implementations for the geospatial statistics community as it is\nparamount to scale computational capability to match the growth in\nenvironmental data coming from the widespread use of different data collection\ntechnologies. In this paper, we develop and deploy large-scale multivariate\nspatial modeling and inference on parallel hardware architectures. To tackle\nthe increasing complexity in matrix operations and the massive concurrency in\nparallel systems, we leverage low-rank matrix approximation techniques with\ntask-based programming models and schedule the asynchronous computational tasks\nusing a dynamic runtime system. The proposed framework provides both the dense\nand the approximated computations of the Gaussian log-likelihood function. It\ndemonstrates accuracy robustness and performance scalability on a variety of\ncomputer systems. Using both synthetic and real datasets, the low-rank matrix\napproximation shows better performance compared to exact computation, while\npreserving the application requirements in both parameter estimation and\nprediction accuracy. We also propose a novel algorithm to assess the prediction\naccuracy after the online parameter estimation. The algorithm quantifies\nprediction performance and provides a benchmark for measuring the efficiency\nand accuracy of several approximation techniques in multivariate spatial\nmodeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 10:24:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2021 11:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}
