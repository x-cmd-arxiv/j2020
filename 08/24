The exquisite precision of the space-based photometric surveys and\nthe unavoidable presence of instrumental systematics and intrinsic stellar\nvariability call for the development of sophisticated methods that separate\nthese signal components from those caused by planetary transits. AIMS. Here we\nintroduce tran_k2 a stand-alone Fortran code to search for planetary transits\nunder the colored noise of stellar variability and instrumental effects. With\nthis code we perform a survey for new candidates. METHODS. Stellar variability\nis represented by a Fourier series, and, if needed, by an autoregressive model\nto avoid excessive Gibbs overshoots at the edges. For the treatment of\nsystematics, cotrending and external parameter decorrelation are employed by\nusing cotrending stars with low stellar variability, the chip position and the\nbackground flux level at the target. The filtering is made within the framework\nof the standard weighted least squares, where the weights are determined\niteratively, to allow robust fit and separate the transit signal from stellar\nvariability and systematics. Once the periods of the transit components are\ndetermined from the filtered data by the box-fitting least squares method, we\nreconstruct the full signal and determine the transit parameters with a higher\naccuracy. This step greatly reduces the excessive attenuation of the transit\ndepths and minimizes shape deformation. RESULTS. The code was tested on the\nfield of Campaign 5 of the K2 mission.

Additionally, we also detect outliers, i.e.,\nthe persons who are not part of the group under consideration. Our proposed\npipeline consists of -- a) a skeletal key points estimator (a total of 17) for\nthe detected human in the scene, b) a learning model (using a feature vector\nbased on the skeletal points) using CRF to detect groups of people and outlier\nperson in a scene, and c) a separate learning model using a multi-class Support\nVector Machine (SVM) to predict the exact F-formation of the group of people in\nthe current scene and the angle of approach for the viewing robot.

This class of models allows one to consider a wider class of\nquantum gravity models, in particular one can formulate state sum models of\nspacetime with an intrinsic notion of foliation. The simplest one of these\nmodels is the one proposed by Benedetti and Henson, which is a matrix model\nformulation of two-dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT). In this\npaper we apply the Functional Renormalization Group Equation (FRGE) to the\nBenedetti-Henson model with the purpose of investigating the possible continuum\nlimits of this class of models. Possible continuum limits appear in this FRGE\napproach as fixed points of the renormalization group flow where the size of\nthe matrix acts as the renormalization scale. Considering very small\ntruncations, we find fixed points that are compatible with analytically known\nresults for CDT in two dimensions. By studying the scheme dependence of our\nresults we find that precision results require larger truncations than the ones\nconsidered in the present work.

I show through direct numerical\nsimulations that in plane Couette and Taylor-Couette flow rotation can strongly\ninfluence wall-to-wall passive tracer transport and make it much faster than\nmomentum transport, clearly in violation of the Reynolds analogy. This\ndifference between passive tracer transport, representative of heat/mass\ntransport, and momentum transport is observed in steady flows with large\ncounter-rotating vortices at low Reynolds numbers as well as in fully turbulent\nflows at higher Reynolds numbers. It is especially large near the neutral\n(Rayleigh's) stability limit. The rotation-induced Coriolis force strongly\ndamps the streamwise/azimuthal velocity fluctuations when this limit is\napproached while tracer fluctuations are much less affected. Accordingly,\nmomentum transport is much more reduced than tracer transport, showing that the\nCoriolis force breaks the Reynolds analogy. At higher Reynolds numbers this\nstrong advective transport dissimilarity is accompanied by approximate limit\ncycle dynamics with intense low-frequency bursts of turbulence when approaching\nthe neutral stability limit.

We propose a statistical framework for the detection of abrupt\nchanges in individual items.

Machine learning and probability theory methods\nhave widespread application for this purpose in different fields. One\ncritically important yet less explored aspect is how data and model\nuncertainties are captured and analyzed. Proper quantification of uncertainty\nprovides valuable information for optimal decision making. This paper reviewed\nrelated studies conducted in the last 30 years (from 1991 to 2020) in handling\nuncertainties in medical data using probability theory and machine learning\ntechniques. Medical data is more prone to uncertainty due to the presence of\nnoise in the data. So, it is very important to have clean medical data without\nany noise to get accurate diagnosis. The sources of noise in the medical data\nneed to be known to address this issue. Based on the medical data obtained by\nthe physician, diagnosis of disease, and treatment plan are prescribed. Hence,\nthe uncertainty is growing in healthcare and there is limited knowledge to\naddress these problems. We have little knowledge about the optimal treatment\nmethods as there are many sources of uncertainty in medical science. Our\nfindings indicate that there are few challenges to be addressed in handling the\nuncertainty in medical raw data and new models. In this work, we have\nsummarized various methods employed to overcome this problem. Nowadays,\napplication of novel deep learning techniques to deal such uncertainties have\nsignificantly increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 21:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

Three mutually perpendicular orientations of the dimer with\nrespect to the rectilinear projectile trajectories are considered and collision\nevents for the two ion-atom subsystems are combined in an impact parameter by\nimpact parameter fashion and are orientation-averaged to calculate\nprobabilities and cross sections for the ion-dimer system. The coupled-channel\ntwo-center basis generator method is used to solve the ion-atom collision\nproblems.

In this paper, we introduce a new class of prior distributions based\non allelic partitions that is specially suited for the small cluster setting of\nrecord linkage. Our approach makes it straightforward to introduce prior\ninformation about the cluster size distribution at different scales, and\nnaturally enforces sublinear growth of the maximum cluster size -known as the\nmicroclustering property. We also introduce a set of novel microclustering\nconditions in order to impose further constraints on the cluster sizes a\npriori. We evaluate the performance of our proposed class of priors using\nsimulated data and three official statistics data sets, and show that our\nmodels provide competitive results compared to state-of-the-art microclustering\nmodels in the record linkage literature.

Under suitable structural assumptions, it is\nshown that this class of equations underlies two families of periodic waves.\nThe first family consists of small amplitude waves with finite fundamental\nperiod which emerge from a Hopf bifurcation around a critical value of the wave\nspeed. The second family pertains to arbitrarily large period waves which arise\nfrom a homoclinic bifurcation and tend to a limiting traveling (homoclinic)\npulse when their fundamental period tends to infinity. For both families, it is\nshown that the Floquet (continuous) spectrum of the linearization around the\nperiodic waves intersects the unstable half plane of complex values with\npositive real part, a property known as spectral instability. For that purpose,\nin the case of small-amplitude waves it is proved that the spectrum of the\nlinearized operator around the wave can be approximated by that of a constant\ncoefficient operator around the zero solution and determined by a dispersion\nrelation which intersects the unstable complex half plane. In the case of large\nperiod waves, we verify that the family satisfies the assumptions of the\nseminal result by Gardner (1997, J. Reine Angew.

Another\nchallenge is to efficiently make use of limited training data for UQ\npredictions of complex engineering problems, particularly with high dimensional\nrandom parameters. We address these challenges by combining data-driven\npolynomial chaos expansions with a recently developed preconditioned sparse\napproximation approach for UQ problems. The first task in this two-step process\nis to employ the procedure developed in (Ahlfeld et al. 2016) to construct an\n\"arbitrary\" polynomial chaos expansion basis using a finite number of\nstatistical moments of the random inputs. The second step is a novel procedure\nto effect sparse approximation via $\\ell^1$ minimization in order to quantify\nthe forward uncertainty. To enhance the performance of the preconditioned\n$\\ell^1$ minimization problem, we sample from the so-called induced\ndistribution, instead of using Monte Carlo (MC) sampling from the original,\nunknown probability measure. We demonstrate on test problems that induced\nsampling is a competitive and often better choice compared with sampling from\nasymptotically optimal measures (such as the equilibrium measure) when we have\nincomplete information about the distribution. We demonstrate the capacity of\nthe proposed induced sampling algorithm via sparse representation with limited\ndata on test functions, and on a Kirchoff plating bending problem with random\nYoung's modulus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 22:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

In the multiple\nsoft scattering regime, for sufficiently large media, soft and wide angle\nemissions can be resummed (in the planar limit of QCD) due to the small\nformation time of each gluon emission. Similarly to DGLAP evolution, such\ncascades correspond to pure Markovian processes and interferences between\npartons are neglected. In this strict limit, color coherence effects are\nabsent. In the vacuum this coherence effect is critical to guarantee that the\nshower is angular ordered. In the medium, it is known that such color coherence\neffects might play a role in suppressing radiation at intermediate emission\nangles. We present a simple procedure to implement color (de)coherence effects\ninto the in-medium evolution equations obtained in the pure Markovian\napproximation.

A related, enduring issue\nin planetary mapping is whether a given crater resulted from a primary impact\n(asteroid or comet) or instead is a secondary crater created by an ejecta\nfragment. With mapping and statistical analyses of six lunar secondary crater\nfields (including Orientale, Copernicus, and Kepler) we provide three new\nconstraints on these issues: 1) estimation of the maximum secondary crater size\nas a function of distance from a primary crater on the Moon, 2) estimation of\nthe size and velocity of ejecta fragments that formed these secondaries, and 3)\nestimation of the fragment size ejected at escape velocity. Through this\nanalysis, we confirmed and extended a suspected scale-dependent trend in ejecta\nsize-velocity distributions. Maximum ejecta fragment sizes fall off much more\nsteeply with increasing ejection velocity for larger primary impacts (compared\nto smaller primary impacts). Specifically, we characterize the maximum ejecta\nsizes for a given ejection velocity with a power law, and find the velocity\nexponent varies between approximately -0.3 and -3 for the range of primary\ncraters investigated here (0.83-660 km in diameter).

It is, however, not always feasible to\nsystematically investigate the sensitivity of nucleation kinetics and mechanism\nto system size due to large computational costs of nucleation studies. Here, we\nuse jumpy forward flux sampling to accurately compute the rates of\nheterogeneous ice nucleation in the vicinity of square-shaped model\nstructureless ice nucleating particles (INPs) of different sizes, and identify\nthree distinct regimes for the dependence of rate on the INP dimension, $L$.\nFor small INPs, the rate is a strong function of $L$ due to artificial spanning\nof critical nuclei across the periodic boundary. Intermediate-sized INPs,\nhowever, give rise to the emergence of non-spanning 'proximal` nuclei that are\nclose enough to their periodic images to fully structure the intermediary\nliquid. While such proximity can facilitate nucleation, its effect is offset by\nthe higher density of the intermediary liquid, leading to artificially small\nnucleation rates overall. The critical nuclei formed at large INPs are neither\nspanning nor proximal. Yet, the rate is a weak function of $L$, with its\nlogarithm scaling linearly with $1/L$. The key heuristic emerging from these\nobservations is that finite size effects will be minimal if critical nuclei are\nneither spanning nor proximal, and if the intermediary liquid has a region that\nis structurally indistinguishable from the supercooled liquid under the same\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 03:37:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 16:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

Non-linear\nredshift-space distortions are one of the leading systematic uncertainties in\ngalaxy clustering.

To explore\nchanges in chemical bonding in lead chalcogenides (PbX, where X = Te, Se, S,\nO), a combination of property-, bond breaking- and quantum-mechanical bonding\ndescriptors have been applied. The outcome of our explorations reveals an\nelectron transfer driven transition from metavalent bonding in PbX (X = Te, Se,\nS) to iono-covalent bonding in beta-PbO. Metavalent bonding is characterized by\nadjacent atoms being held together by sharing about a single electron and small\nelectron transfer (ET). The transition from metavalent to iono-covalent bonding\nmanifests itself in clear changes in these quantum-mechanical descriptors (ES\nand ET), as well as in property-based descriptors (i.e. Born effective charge,\ndielectric function, effective coordination number (ECON) and mode-specific\nGrueneisen parameter, and in bond breaking descriptors (PME). Metavalent\nbonding collapses, if significant charge localization occurs at the ion cores\n(ET) and/or in the interatomic region (ES). Predominantly changing the degree\nof electron transfer opens possibilities to tailor materials properties such as\nthe chemical bond and electronic polarizability, optical band gap and optical\ninterband transitions characterized by the imaginary part of the dielectric\nfunction. Hence, the insights gained from this study highlight the\ntechnological relevance of the concept of metavalent bonding and its potential\nfor materials design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 06:31:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

Therefore, it has been considered as a promising technique for the\nupcoming 5G communications and beyond. However, most current studies on\nbeamspace MIMO have not taken into account the important power leakage problem\nin beamspace channels, which possibly leads to a significant degradation in the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the system sum-rate. To this end, we propose a\nbeam aligning precoding method to handle the power leakage problem in this\npaper. Firstly, a phase shifter network (PSN) structure is proposed, which\nenables each RF chain in beamspace MIMO to select multiple beams to collect the\nleakage power. Then, a rotation-based precoding algorithm is designed based on\nthe proposed PSN structure, which aligns the channel gains of the selected\nbeams towards the same direction for maximizing the received SNR at each user.\nFurthermore, we reveal some system design insights by analyzing the sum-rate\nand energy efficiency (EE) of the proposed beam aligning precoding method. In\nsimulations, the proposed approach is found to achieve the near-optimal\nsum-rate performance compared with the ideal case of no power leakage, and\nobtains a higher EE than the existing schemes with either a linear or planar\narray.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 07:12:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

For VMR, several methods\nthat require full supervision for training have been proposed. Unfortunately,\nacquiring a large number of training videos with labeled temporal boundaries\nfor each query is a labor-intensive process. This paper explores methods for\nperforming VMR in a weakly-supervised manner (wVMR): training is performed\nwithout temporal moment labels but only with the text query that describes a\nsegment of the video. Existing methods on wVMR generate multi-scale proposals\nand apply query-guided attention mechanisms to highlight the most relevant\nproposal. To leverage the weak supervision, contrastive learning is used which\npredicts higher scores for the correct video-query pairs than for the incorrect\npairs. It has been observed that a large number of candidate proposals, coarse\nquery representation, and one-way attention mechanism lead to blurry attention\nmaps which limit the localization performance. To handle this issue,\nVideo-Language Alignment Network (VLANet) is proposed that learns sharper\nattention by pruning out spurious candidate proposals and applying a\nmulti-directional attention mechanism with fine-grained query representation.\nThe Surrogate Proposal Selection module selects a proposal based on the\nproximity to the query in the joint embedding space, and thus substantially\nreduces candidate proposals which leads to lower computation load and sharper\nattention. Next, the Cascaded Cross-modal Attention module considers dense\nfeature interactions and multi-directional attention flow to learn the\nmulti-modal alignment. VLANet is trained end-to-end using contrastive loss\nwhich enforces semantically similar videos and queries to gather.

Molecular dynamics simulations employing the Go-like\nmodel for the proteins show that at intermediate and high temperatures,\nincluding a presumable physiological temperature, the protein escape process at\nthe atomistic tunnel is quantitatively similar to that at a cylinder tunnel of\nlength L = 72 {\\AA} and diameter d = 16 {\\AA}. At low temperatures, the\natomistic tunnel, however, yields an increased probability of protein trapping\ninside the tunnel while the cylinder tunnel does not cause the trapping.\nAll-$\\beta$ proteins tend to escape faster than all-$\\alpha$ proteins but this\ndifference is blurred on increasing the protein's chain length. A 29-residue\nzinc-finger domain is shown to be severely trapped inside the tunnel. Most of\nthe single-domain proteins considered, however, can escape efficiently at the\nphysiological temperature with the escape time distribution following the\ndiffusion model proposed in our previous works. An extrapolation of the\nsimulation data to a realistic value of the friction coefficient for amino\nacids indicates that the escape times of globular proteins are at the\nsub-millisecond scale. It is argued that this time scale is short enough for\nthe smooth functioning of the ribosome by not allowing nascent proteins to jam\nthe ribosome tunnel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 08:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

Most existing methods for estimating the\nface reflectance from a monocular image assume faces to be diffuse with very\nfew approaches adding a specular component. This still leaves out important\nperceptual aspects of reflectance as higher-order global illumination effects\nand self-shadowing are not modeled. We present a new neural representation for\nface reflectance where we can estimate all components of the reflectance\nresponsible for the final appearance from a single monocular image. Instead of\nmodeling each component of the reflectance separately using parametric models,\nour neural representation allows us to generate a basis set of faces in a\ngeometric deformation-invariant space, parameterized by the input light\ndirection, viewpoint and face geometry. We learn to reconstruct this\nreflectance field of a face just from a monocular image, which can be used to\nrender the face from any viewpoint in any light condition. Our method is\ntrained on a light-stage training dataset, which captures 300 people\nilluminated with 150 light conditions from 8 viewpoints.

Based on the extrapolated CME kinematics, we identified interacting CMEs,\nwhich were excluded from further analysis. Applying this approach, a set of 31\nisolated Earth-impacting CMEs was unambiguously identified and related to the\nin situ measurements recorded by the Wind spacecraft. We classified the events\ninto subsets with respect to the CME source location as well as with respect to\nthe type of the associated filament eruption. Hence, the events are divided\ninto three subsamples: active region (AR) CMEs, disappearing filament (DSF)\nCMEs, and stealthy CMEs. The related three groups of ICMEs were further divided\ninto two subsets: magnetic obstacle (MO) events (out of which four were\nstealthy), covering ICMEs that at least partly expose characteristics of flux\nropes, and ejecta (EJ) events, not showing such characteristics. In the next\nstep, MO-events were analysed in more detail, considering the magnetic field\nstrengths and the plasma characteristics in three different segments of the\nICMEs, defined as the turbulent sheath (TS), the frontal region (FR), and the\nMO itself. The analysis revealed various well-defined correlations for AR, DSF,\nand stealthy ICMEs, which we interpreted considering basic physical concepts.\nOur results support the hypothesis that ICMEs show different signatures\ndepending on the in situ spacecraft trajectory, in terms of apex versus flank\nhits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 08:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

Many of previous works are, however, limited to identifying\nindividual tracks in a mix or segmenting it, and the sizes of the datasets are\nusually small. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of DJ music by\naligning a mix to its original music tracks.

This approach provides temporally tight\nmix-to-track matching from which we can obtain cue-points, transition length,\nmix segmentation, and musical changes in DJ performance. Using 1,557 mixes from\n1001Tracklists including 13,728 tracks and 20,765 transitions, we conduct the\nproposed analysis and show a wide range of statistics, which may elucidate the\ncreative process of DJ music making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 08:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

How a material interacts with different fluids at different Reynold\nnumbers has to be studied before it is passed over to the manufacturing\nprocess. In addition, examining the same model not only for different fluids\nbut also for different solids allows to optimize the choice of materials for\nconstruction even better. A possible answer on this demand is\nparameter-dependent discretization. Furthermore, low-rank techniques can reduce\nthe complexity needed to compute approximations to parameter-dependent\nfluid-structure interaction discretizations.\n  Low-rank methods have been applied to parameter-dependent linear\nfluid-structure interaction discretizations. The linearity of the operators\ninvolved allows to translate the resulting equations to a single matrix\nequation. The solution is approximated by a low-rank method. In this paper, we\npropose a new method that extends this framework to nonlinear\nparameter-dependent fluid-structure interaction problems by means of the Newton\niteration. The parameter set is split into disjoint subsets. On each subset,\nthe Newton approximation of the problem related to the upper median parameter\nis computed and serves as initial guess for one Newton step on the whole\nsubset. This Newton step yields a matrix equation whose solution can be\napproximated by a low-rank method.\n  The resulting method requires a smaller number of Newton steps if compared\nwith a direct approach that applies the Newton iteration to the separate\nproblems consecutively. In the experiments considered, the proposed method\nallowed to compute a low-rank approximation within a twentieth of the time used\nby the direct approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 09:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

Several efforts exist to manually design architectures with high\naccuracy in point cloud tasks such as classification, segmentation, and\ndetection. Recent progress in automatic Neural Architecture Search (NAS)\nminimizes the human effort in network design and optimizes high performing\narchitectures. However, these efforts fail to consider important factors such\nas latency during inference. Latency is of high importance in time critical\napplications like self-driving cars, robot navigation, and mobile applications,\nthat are generally bound by the available hardware. In this paper, we introduce\na new NAS framework, dubbed LC-NAS, where we search for point cloud\narchitectures that are constrained to a target latency. We implement a novel\nlatency constraint formulation to trade-off between accuracy and latency in our\narchitecture search. Contrary to previous works, our latency loss guarantees\nthat the final network achieves latency under a specified target value. This is\ncrucial when the end task is to be deployed in a limited hardware setting.\nExtensive experiments show that LC-NAS is able to find state-of-the-art\narchitectures for point cloud classification in ModelNet40 with minimal\ncomputational cost. We also show how our searched architectures achieve any\ndesired latency with a reasonably low drop in accuracy. Finally, we show how\nour searched architectures easily transfer to a different task, part\nsegmentation on PartNet, where we achieve state-of-the-art results while\nlowering latency by a factor of 10.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 10:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

By tuning each partitioning technique for optimal\nperformance, we show that (i) machine learned search within a partition is\nfaster by 11.79\\% to 39.51\\% than binary search when using filtering on one\ndimension, (ii) the bottleneck for tree structures is index lookup, which could\npotentially be improved by linearizing the indexed partitions (iii) filtering\non one dimension and refining using machine learned indexes is 1.23x to 1.83x\ntimes faster than closest competitor which filters on two dimensions, and (iv)\nlearned indexes can have a significant impact on the performance of low\nselectivity queries while being less effective under higher selectivities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 12:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

In\naddition, multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple access (MIMO\nNOMA) is a potential candidate to improve the spectral efficiency, reliability,\nlatency, and connectivity of wireless systems. In this paper, we investigate\nshort-packet communications (SPC) in a multiuser downlink MIMO NOMA system over\nNakagami-m fading, and propose two antenna-user selection methods considering\ntwo clusters of users having different priority levels. In contrast to the\nwidely-used long data-packet assumption, the SPC analysis requires the redesign\nof the communication protocols and novel performance metrics. Given this\ncontext, we analyze the SPC performance of MIMO NOMA systems using the average\nblock error rate (BLER) and minimum blocklength, instead of the conventional\nmetrics such as ergodic capacity and outage capacity. More specifically, to\ncharacterize the system performance regarding SPC, asymptotic (in the high\nsignal-to-noise ratio regime) and approximate closed-form expressions of the\naverage BLER at the users are derived. Based on the asymptotic behavior of the\naverage BLER, an analysis of the diversity order, minimum blocklength, and\noptimal power allocation is carried out. The achieved results show that MIMO\nNOMA can serve multiple users simultaneously using a smaller blocklength\ncompared with MIMO OMA, thus demonstrating the benefits of MIMO NOMA for SPC in\nminimizing the transmission latency. Furthermore, our results indicate that the\nproposed methods not only improve the BLER performance but also guarantee full\ndiversity gains for the respective users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 12:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

For instance, in the\ncontext of vehicle routing, one route would minimize the total distance\ntraveled, while other routes would also consider the total travel time or the\ntotal incurred cost, or combinations thereof. In general, providing such a set\nof diverse routes is obtained by finding optimal routes with respect to\ndifferent sets of weights on the network edges. This can be simply achieved by\nconsecutively executing a standard shortest path algorithm. However, in the\ncase of a large number of weight sets, this may require an excessively large\nnumber of executions of such an algorithm, thus incurring a prohibitively large\nrunning time.\n  We indicate that, quite often, the different edge weights reflect different\ncombinations of some \"raw\" performance metrics (e.g., delay, cost). In such\ncases, there is an inherent dependency among the different weights of the same\nedge. This may well result in some similarity among the shortest routes, each\nof which being optimal with respect to a specific set of weights. In this\nstudy, we aim to exploit such similarity in order to improve the performance of\nthe solution scheme.\n  Specifically, we contemplate edge weights that are obtained through different\nlinear combinations of some (``raw'') edge performance metrics. We establish\nand validate a novel algorithm that efficiently computes a shortest path for\neach set of edge weights. We demonstrate that, under reasonable assumptions,\nthe algorithm significantly outperforms the standard approach. Similarly to the\nstandard approach, the algorithm iteratively searches for routes, one per set\nof edge weights; however, instead of executing each iteration independently, it\nreduces the average running time by skillfully sharing information among the\niterations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 13:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

A major drawback of these networks is\nthat they require a large number of hidden units. In this paper, we propose a\ntechnique to reduce the number of hidden units substantially without affecting\nthe accuracy of the networks significantly. We introduce the concept of primary\nand secondary hidden units. The weights for the primary hidden units are chosen\nrandomly while the secondary hidden units are derived using pairwise\ncombinations of the primary hidden units. Using this technique, we show that\nthe number of hidden units can be reduced by at least one order of magnitude.\nWe experimentally show that this technique leads to significant drop in\ncomputations at inference time and has only a minor impact on network accuracy.\nA huge reduction in computations is possible if slightly lower accuracy is\nacceptable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 13:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-25"}

Here we report on the first three-dimensional realistic simulations of\nsolar local dynamo where all three effects were taken into account. The\nsimulations started with a snapshot of already saturated battery-seeded dynamo,\nwhere two new series were developed: one with solely ambipolar diffusion and\nanother one also taking into account the Hall term in the generalized Ohm's\nlaw. The simulations were then run for about 4 hours of solar time to reach the\nstationary regime and improve the statistics. In parallel, a purely MHD dynamo\nsimulation was also run for the same amount of time. The simulations are\ncompared in a statistical way. The results show that, with the inclusion of the\nambipolar diffusion, the amplitudes of the incompressible perturbations related\nto Alfven waves are reduced, and the Poynting flux is absorbed, with a\nfrequency dependence. The Hall effect causes the opposite action: significant\nexcess of incompressible perturbations is generated and an excess of the\nPoynting flux is observed in the chromospheric layers. The model with ambipolar\ndiffusion shows, on average, sharper current sheets and slightly more abundant\nfast magneto-acoustic shocks in the chromosphere. The model with the Hall\neffect has higher temperatures at the lower chromosphere and stronger and more\nvertical magnetic field concentrations all over the chromosphere. The study of\nhigh-frequency waves reveals that significant power of incompressible\nperturbations is associated with areas with intense and more vertical magnetic\nfields and larger temperatures.

The fraction\nof such particles produced in a heavy ion collision is related to the\ndissociation level caused by the plasma. On the other hand, the dissociation of\n$J/\\Psi $ in the plasma is influenced by the temperature and the density of the\nmedium and also by the presence of magnetic fields, that are produced in non\ncentral collisions.

However,\nstate-of-the-art solutions for deep image compression typically employ\nautoencoders which map the input to a lower dimensional latent space and thus\nirreversibly discard information already before quantization. Due to that, they\ninherently limit the range of quality levels that can be covered. In contrast,\ntraditional approaches in image compression allow for a larger range of quality\nlevels. Interestingly, they employ an invertible transformation before\nperforming the quantization step which explicitly discards information.\nInspired by this, we propose a deep image compression method that is able to go\nfrom low bit-rates to near lossless quality by leveraging normalizing flows to\nlearn a bijective mapping from the image space to a latent representation. In\naddition to this, we demonstrate further advantages unique to our solution,\nsuch as the ability to maintain constant quality results through re-encoding,\neven when performed multiple times.

However, due to many convolution\noperations are conducted on the high-resolution feature maps, such\ndilatedFCN-based methods result in large computational complexity and memory\nconsumption.

The model is based on a series of functional relationships linking the\nbenefits of extra capacity and the associated costs. It takes into account the\ncost of delay for airlines and its indirect consequences on the airport,\nthrough the loss or gain of aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenues. The\nmodel is highly data-driven and to this end a number of data sources have been\nused. In particular, special care has been used to take into account the full\ndistribution of delay at the airports rather than its average only. The results\nwith the simple version of the model show the existence of a unique maximum for\nthe operating profit of the airport in terms of capacity. The position of this\nmaximum is clearly dependent on the airport and also has an interesting\nbehaviour with the average number of passenger per aircraft at the airport and\nthe predictability of the flight departure times. In addition, we also show\nthat there exists an important trade-off between an increased predictability\nand the punctuality at the airport. Finally, it is shown that a more complex\nbehavioural model for passengers can introduce several local maxima in the\nairport profit and thus drive the airport towards suboptimal decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 14:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

Both frameworks showed similar accuracy; however, despite\nits complexity and computational cost, the physics-integrated ML offers\nprincipal advantages, namely: (i) the target outputs (labeled training data)\nfor a NN might be unknown and can be recovered using PDEs; (ii) it is not\nnecessary to extract and preprocess information (training targets) from big\ndata, instead it can be extracted by PDEs; (iii) there is no need to employ a\nphysics- or scale-separation assumptions to build a closure model. The\nadvantage (i) is demonstrated in this paper, while the advantages (ii) and\n(iii) are the subjects for future work. Such integration of PDEs with ML opens\na door for a tighter data-knowledge connection, which may potentially influence\nthe further development of the physics-based modelling with ML for data-driven\nthermal fluid models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 15:20:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 14:09:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 21:33:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 15:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

LCTs are considered in many fields. In quantum\ntheory, they can be identified with linear transformations which keep invariant\nthe Canonical Commutation Relations (CCRs). In this work, LCTs corresponding to\na general pseudo-Euclidian space are considered and related to a phase space\nrepresentation of quantum theory. Explicit calculations are firstly performed\nfor the monodimensional case to identify the corresponding LCT-invariant\nquadratic operators then multidimensional generalizations of the obtained\nresults are deduced. The eigenstates of these operators are also identified. A\nfirst kind of LCT-invariant operator is a second order polynomial of the\ncoordinates and momenta operators and is a generalization of reduced momentum\ndispersion operator. The coefficients of this polynomial depend on the mean\nvalues and the statistical variances-covariances of the coordinates and momenta\noperators themselves. It is shown that these statistical variances-covariances\ncan be related with thermodynamic variables. Two other LCT-invariant quadratic\noperators, which can be considered as the number operators of some\nquasipartciles, are also identified: the first one is a number operator of\nbosonic type quasiparticles and the second one corresponds to fermionic type.\nThis fermionic LCT-invariant quadratic operator is directly related to a spin\nrepresentation of LCTs. It is shown explicitly, in the case of a\npentadimensional theory, that the eigenstates of this operator can be\nconsidered as basic quantum states of elementary fermions.

Continuous feed forward procedure is required in order for\nbackward propagate to function properly. Doubting the underlying physical\ninterpretation on transformer based models such as GPT brought about by the\nroutine explaination, a new method of training is proposed in order to keep\nself-consistency of the physics. By treating the GPT model as a space-time\ndiagram, and then trace the worldlines of signals, identifing the possible\npaths of signals in order fot a self-attention event to occure. With a slight\nmodification, self-attention can be viewed as an ising model interaction, which\nenables the goal to be designed as energy of system.

A\nprobability network is designed to pilot input signals travelling for different\ndurations through different routes.
