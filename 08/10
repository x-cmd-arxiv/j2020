During these events, clusters of\nblocks slide abruptly, simulating seismic slip and earthquake rupture. Here we\npropose a theory for preventing GBK avalanches, control its dynamics and incite\nslow-slip. We exploit the dependence of friction on pressure and use it as a\nbackdoor for altering the dynamics of the system. We use the mathematical\nTheory of Control and, for the first time, we succeed in (a) stabilizing and\nrestricting chaos in GBK models, (b) guaranteeing slow frictional dissipation\nand (c) tuning the GBK system toward desirable global asymptotic equilibria of\nlower energy.

To promote imaging performance, it is\nnecessary to restore the important visual information from degraded low-light\nimages. In this paper, we propose to enhance the low-light images through\nregularized illumination optimization and deep noise suppression. In\nparticular, a hybrid regularized variational model, which combines L0-norm\ngradient sparsity prior with structure-aware regularization, is presented to\nrefine the coarse illumination map originally estimated using Max-RGB. The\nadaptive gamma correction method is then introduced to adjust the refined\nillumination map. Based on the assumption of Retinex theory, a guided\nfilter-based detail boosting method is introduced to optimize the reflection\nmap. The adjusted illumination and optimized reflection maps are finally\ncombined to generate the enhanced maritime images. To suppress the effect of\nunwanted noise on imaging performance, a deep learning-based blind denoising\nframework is further introduced to promote the visual quality of enhanced\nimage. In particular, this framework is composed of two sub-networks, i.e.,\nE-Net and D-Net adopted for noise level estimation and non-blind noise\nreduction, respectively.

However, the large\nnumber of decision variables, especially the binary decision variables of\nreconfiguration, bring challenges on developing effective distributed\ndistribution service restoration (DDSR) strategies. This paper proposes a\nscalable distributed optimization method based on the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM) for non-convex mixed-integer optimization problems\nand applies to develop the DDSR framework. The non-convex ADMM method consists\nof relax-drive-polish phases, 1) relaxing binary variables and applying the\nconvex ADMM as a warm start; 2) driving the solutions toward Boolean values\nthrough a proximal operator; 3) fixing the obtained binary variables to polish\ncontinuous variables for a high-quality solution. Then, an autonomous\nclustering strategy together with consensus ADMM is developed to realize the\ndistributed cluster-based framework of restoration. The nonconvex ADMM-based\nDDSR can determine DER scheduling and switch status for reconfiguration and\nload pickup in a distributed manner, energizing the out-of-service area from\nlocal faults or total blackouts in large-scale distribution networks. The\neffectiveness and scalability of the proposed DDSR framework are demonstrated\nthrough testing on the IEEE 123-node and IEEE 8500-node test feeders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2020 18:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

In this paper, the motion pattern of a person is\nexplored as an additional cue for ReID. In particular, a flow-guided Mutual\nAttention network is proposed for fusion of image and optical flow sequences\nusing any 2D-CNN backbone, allowing to encode temporal information along with\nspatial appearance information. Our Mutual Attention network relies on the\njoint spatial attention between image and optical flow features maps to\nactivate a common set of salient features across them. In addition to\nflow-guided attention, we introduce a method to aggregate features from longer\ninput streams for better video sequence-level representation. Our extensive\nexperiments on three challenging video ReID datasets indicate that using the\nproposed Mutual Attention network allows to improve recognition accuracy\nconsiderably with respect to conventional gated-attention networks, and\nstate-of-the-art methods for video-based person ReID.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2020 18:58:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2020 23:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

However, in real scenarios, it is inevitable to capture\nincomplete or noisy skeletons, which could significantly deteriorate the\nperformance of current methods when some informative joints are occluded or\ndisturbed. To improve the robustness of action recognition models, a\nmulti-stream graph convolutional network (GCN) is proposed to explore\nsufficient discriminative features spreading over all skeleton joints, so that\nthe distributed redundant representation reduces the sensitivity of the action\nmodels to non-standard skeletons. Concretely, the backbone GCN is extended by a\nseries of ordered streams which is responsible for learning discriminative\nfeatures from the joints less activated by preceding streams. Here, the\nactivation degrees of skeleton joints of each GCN stream are measured by the\nclass activation maps (CAM), and only the information from the unactivated\njoints will be passed to the next stream, by which rich features over all\nactive joints are obtained. Thus, the proposed method is termed richly\nactivated GCN (RA-GCN).

This paper proposes a three-step method for a humanoid robot to reason\nabout the feasibility of lifting a heavy box with physical properties that are\nunknown to the robot. Since feasibility of lifting is directly related to the\nphysical properties of the box, we first discretize a range for the unknown\nvalues of parameters describing these properties and tabulate all valid optimal\nquasi-static lifting trajectories generated by simulations over all\ncombinations of indices. Second, a physical-interaction-based algorithm is\nintroduced to identify the robust gripping position and physical parameters\ncorresponding to the box.

Natural between-instance similarity\nconflicts with the presumed instance distinction, causing unstable training and\npoor performance.\n  Our idea is to discover and integrate between-instance similarity into\ncontrastive learning, not directly by instance grouping, but by cross-level\ndiscrimination (CLD) between instances and local instance groups. While\ninvariant mapping of each instance is imposed by attraction within its\naugmented views, between-instance similarity could emerge from common repulsion\nagainst instance groups.\n  Our batch-wise and cross-view comparisons also greatly improve the\npositive/negative sample ratio of contrastive learning and achieve better\ninvariant mapping.

Since the dynamics of this asteroid is\npredictable only on short time intervals, and not only close and/or multiple\nclose encounters with major planets, but also the presence of at least one\nunstable resonance can lead to chaotic motion of test particles, we studied\ntheir resonant dynamics.

Eliminating the solvent\ndensity deviation in $\\cal F$, we obtain the effective non-Coulombic\ninteractions among the ions, which consist of the direct ones and the\nsolvent-mediated ones. %where the latter are written in terms of the ion\nvolumes %and are inversely proportional to the solvent compressibility. We then\nderive general expressions for the ion correlation, the apparent partial\nvolume, and the activity and osmotic coefficients up to linear order in the\naverage salt density $n_{\\rm s}$. Secondly, we perform numerical analysis using\nthe Mansoori-Carnahan-Starling-Leland model $[$J. Chem. Phys. {\\bf 54}, 1523\n(1971)$]$ for three-component hardspheres. The effective interactions\nsensitively depend on the cation and anion sizes due to competition between the\nsteric and hydration effects, which are repulsive between small-large ion pairs\nand attractive between symmetric pairs. These agree with previous experiments\nand Collins' rule $[$Biophys. J. {\\bf 72}, 65 (1997)$]$. We also give simple\napproximate expressions for the ionic interaction coefficients valid for any\nion sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2020 23:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-20"}

Most existing works\nfocus on discriminative feature transformation, metric learning and cross-modal\nface synthesis. However, the fact that cross-modal faces are always coupled by\ndomain (modality) and identity information has received little attention.\nTherefore, how to learn and utilize the domain-private feature and\ndomain-agnostic feature for modality adaptive face recognition is the focus of\nthis work. Specifically, this paper proposes a Feature Aggregation Network\n(FAN), which includes disentangled representation module (DRM), feature fusion\nmodule (FFM) and adaptive penalty metric (APM) learning session. First, in DRM,\ntwo subnetworks, i.e. domain-private network and domain-agnostic network are\nspecially designed for learning modality features and identity features,\nrespectively. Second, in FFM, the identity features are fused with domain\nfeatures to achieve cross-modal bi-directional identity feature transformation,\nwhich, to a large extent, further disentangles the modality information and\nidentity information. Third, considering that the distribution imbalance\nbetween easy and hard pairs exists in cross-modal datasets, which increases the\nrisk of model bias, the identity preserving guided metric learning with\nadaptive hard pairs penalization is proposed in our FAN. The proposed APM also\nguarantees the cross-modality intra-class compactness and inter-class\nseparation. Extensive experiments on benchmark cross-modal face datasets show\nthat our FAN outperforms SOTA methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 00:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

Often, it is\nessential to understand internal working mechanisms of unknown systems (e.g.\nbiological networks) in addition to input-output relationships. For this\npurpose, various feature selection techniques have been developed. For example,\nsparse Bayesian learning (SBL) was proposed to learn major features from a\ndictionary of basis functions, which makes identified models interpretable.\nReweighted L1-regularization algorithms are often applied in SBL to solve\noptimization problems. However, they are expensive in both computation and\nmemory aspects, thus not suitable for large-scale problems.

We are motivated by the problem of developing high-order accurate\nnumerical solvers for elliptic boundary value problems on complex geometry\nusing overset grids. Overset grids are typically dominated by large Cartesian\nbackground grids and thus fast solvers for Cartesian grids are highly desired.\nFor flexibility in grid generation we would like to consider coarsening factors\nother than two, and lower-order accurate coarse-level approximations. We show\nthat second-order accurate coarse-level approximations are very effective for\nfourth- or sixth-order accurate fine-level finite difference discretizations.\nWe study the use of different Galerkin and non-Galerkin coarse-level operators.\nWe use red-black smoothers with a relaxation parameter $\\omega$.

It is well-known that\nnormalization can facilitate fast convergence. Therefore, we explore\nnormalization in the design of loss functions for IQA. Specifically, we first\nnormalize the predicted quality scores and the corresponding subjective quality\nscores. Then, the loss is defined based on the norm of the differences between\nthese normalized values. The resulting \"Norm-in-Norm'' loss encourages the IQA\nmodel to make linear predictions with respect to subjective quality scores.\nAfter training, the least squares regression is applied to determine the linear\nmapping from the predicted quality to the subjective quality. It is shown that\nthe new loss is closely connected with two common IQA performance criteria\n(PLCC and RMSE). Through theoretical analysis, it is proved that the embedded\nnormalization makes the gradients of the loss function more stable and more\npredictable, which is conducive to the faster convergence of the IQA model.\nFurthermore, to experimentally verify the effectiveness of the proposed loss,\nit is applied to solve a challenging problem: quality assessment of in-the-wild\nimages. Experiments on two relevant datasets (KonIQ-10k and CLIVE) show that,\ncompared to MAE or MSE loss, the new loss enables the IQA model to converge\nabout 10 times faster and the final model achieves better performance.

We propose two types of controllers:\n(i) a continuous controller inspired by the online gradient descent method, and\n(ii) a hybrid controller that can be interpreted as an online version of\nNesterov's accelerated gradient method with restarts of the state variables. By\ndesign, the controllers continuously steer the system towards the time-varying\noptimizer without requiring knowledge of exogenous disturbances affecting the\nsystem. For cost functions that are smooth and satisfy the Polyak-\\L ojasiewicz\ninequality, we demonstrate that the online gradient-flow controller ensures\nuniform global exponential stability when the time scales of the system and\ncontroller are sufficiently separated and the switching signal of the system\nvaries slowly on average. For cost functions that are strongly convex, we show\nthat the hybrid accelerated controller outperforms the continuous gradient\ndescent method. When the cost function is not strongly convex, we show that the\nthe hybrid accelerated method guarantees global practical asymptotic stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 05:16:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 16:50:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

With technical prowess in graphic analysis, the author\nunveiled the closed-form solution for the optimal dispatch rates (with key\nvariables undetermined though), but only suggested the lower and upper bounds\nof the optimal fleet size. Additionally, such a graphic analysis method lacks\nhigh efficiency in computing specific scheduling problems, which are often of a\nlarge scale (e.g., hundreds of bus lines). In light of this, the paper proposes\na novel mathematical solution approach that first relaxes the original problem\nto an unconstrained one, and then attacks it using calculus of variations. The\ncorresponding Euler-Lagrange equation yields the closed-form solution of the\noptimal dispatching rates, to which Hurdle's results are a special case. Thanks\nto the proposed approach, the optimal fleet size can also be solved. This paper\ncompletes the work of Hurdle (1973) by formalizing a solution method and\ngeneralizing the results.

However, it is difficult to account for the\ndistribution of interface inhomogeneity as most techniques average over the\nspot-area of the analytical tool, or the entire device measured for electrical\nI-V measurements. Commonly used models to extract Schottky barrier heights\n(SBH) neglect or fail to account for such inhomogeneities, which can lead to\nthe extraction of incorrect SBH and Richardson constants. Here, we show that a\ngaussian modified thermionic emission model gives the best fit to experimental\nI-V-T data of van der Waals Au/p-MoS2 interfaces and allow the deconvolution of\nthe SBH of the defective regions from the pristine region. By the inclusion of\na gaussian distributed SBH in the macroscopic I-V-T analysis, we demonstrate\nthat interface inhomogeneities due to defects are deconvoluted and well\ncorrelated to the impact on the device behavior across a wide temperature range\nfrom room temperature of 300 K down to 120 K. We verified the gaussian\nthermionic model across two different types of p-MoS2 (geological and\nsynthetic), and finally compared the macroscopic SBH with the results of a\nnanoscopic technique, ballistic hole emission microscopy (BHEM). The results\nobtained using BHEM were consistent with the pristine Au/p-MoS2 SBH extracted\nfrom the gaussian modified thermionic emission model over hundreds of\nnanometers. Our findings show that the inclusion of Schottky barrier\ninhomogeneities in the analysis of I-V-T data is important to elucidate the\nimpact of defects (e.g. grain boundaries, metallic impurities, etc.) and hence\ntheir influence on device behavior. We also find that the Richardson constant,\na material specific constant typically treated as merely a fitting constant, is\nan important parameter to check for the validity of the transport model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 07:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

First, regarding the\nconnectivity of $W_{G, d}$, we generalize a result of Maehara that $W_{G, d}$\nis nonempty for $d \\geq n$ to show that $W_{G, d}$ is $k$-connected for $d \\geq\nn + k + 1$, and so $W_{G, \\infty}$ is always contractible.

Here we point\nout that protoplanets born through Gravitational Instability (GI) may remain in\nan initial pre-collapse phase for as long as the first $ 10^5-10^7$ years after\nformation. These objects are hundreds of times larger than Jupiter and their\natmospheres are too cold ($T\\sim$ tens of K) to emit in the NIR or H$\\alpha$\nvia accretion shocks. However, it is possible that their dust emission can be\ndetected with ALMA, even around Class I and II protoplanetary discs. In this\npaper we produce synthetic observations of these protoplanets. We find that\nmaking a detection in a disc at 140 parsecs would require a few hundred minutes\nof ALMA band 6 observation time. Protoplanets with masses of 3-5 $M_J$ have the\nhighest chance of being detected; less massive objects require unreasonably\nlong observation times (1000 minutes) while more massive ones collapse into\ngiant planets before $10^5$ years.

Because of the complex background, and high density,\nmost of the existing methods fail to accurately extract a road network that\nappears correct and complete. Moreover, they suffer from either insufficient\ntraining data or high costs of manual annotation. To address these problems, we\nintroduce a new model to apply structured domain adaption for synthetic image\ngeneration and road segmentation. We incorporate a feature pyramid network into\ngenerative adversarial networks to minimize the difference between the source\nand target domains. A generator is learned to produce quality synthetic images,\nand the discriminator attempts to distinguish them.

For\nthis analysis, a chi-squared test was executed on a compiled list of past\nmeasurements.

We find that many-body interactions of the Voronoi\nmixture do not lead to strong qualitative differences relative to similar\nanalyses carried out for simple liquids with pair-wise interactions.

This overestimation appears to be weak relative to other\nwell-studied supercooled-liquid models such as the binary Kob--Andersen\nLennard-Jones mixture. Overall, the agreement between MCT and simulation\nsuggests that it is possible to predict several microscopic dynamic properties\nwith qualitative, and in some cases near-quantitative, accuracy based solely on\nstatic two-point structural correlations, even though the system itself is\ninherently governed by many-body interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 11:50:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

Aims: We present the discovery and study of SN 2020bqj (ZTF20aalrqbu), a\nSN Ibn with a long-duration peak plateau lasting 40 days and hosted by a faint\nlow-mass galaxy. We aim to explain its peculiar properties using an extensive\ndata set. Methods: We compare the evolution of SN 2020bqj with SNe Ibn from the\nliterature. We fit the bolometric and multi-band lightcurves with different\npowering mechanism models. Results: The risetime, peak magnitude and spectral\nfeatures of SN 2020bqj are consistent with those of most SNe Ibn, but the SN is\na clear outlier based on its bright, long-lasting peak plateau and low host\nmass. We show through modeling that the lightcurve can be powered predominantly\nby shock heating from the interaction of the SN ejecta and a dense CSM. The\npeculiar Type Ibn SN 2011hw is a close analog to SN 2020bqj, suggesting a\nsimilar progenitor and CSM scenario. In this scenario a very massive progenitor\nstar in the transitional phase between a luminous blue variable and a compact\nWolf-Rayet star undergoes core-collapse, embedded in a dense helium-rich CSM\nwith an elevated opacity compared to normal SNe Ibn, due to the presence of\nresidual hydrogen.

On the basis of\nqualitative comparisons, we show that topologically non-trivial objects would\nleave a strong imprint on electromagnetic observables and can be easily\ndistinguished from general-relativistic black holes in nearly all cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 12:43:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

Detecting these GAN-generated images (GAN-images) becomes\nincreasingly challenging due to the significant reduction of underlying\nartifacts and specific patterns. The absence of such traces can hinder\ndetection algorithms from identifying GAN-images and transferring knowledge to\nidentify other types of GAN-images as well. In this work, we present the\nTransferable GAN-images Detection framework T-GD, a robust transferable\nframework for an effective detection of GAN-images. T-GD is composed of a\nteacher and a student model that can iteratively teach and evaluate each other\nto improve the detection performance.

This work revisits\nan important yet often overlooked piece of the puzzle: what should the QoE\nabstraction be? A QoE abstraction is a representation of application quality\nthat describes how decisions affect QoE. The conventional wisdom has relied on\ndeveloping hand-crafted quality metrics (e.g., video rebuffering events, web\npage loading time) that are specialized to each application, content, and\nsetting. We argue that in many cases, it maybe fundamentally hard to capture a\nuser's perception of quality using a list of handcrafted metrics, and that\nexpanding the metric list may lead to unnecessary complexity in the QoE model\nwithout a commensurate gain. Instead, we advocate for a new approach based on a\nnew QoE abstraction called visual rendering. Rather than a list of metrics, we\nmodel the process of quality perception as a user watching a continuous \"video\"\n(visual rendering) of all the pixels on their screen. The key advantage of\nvisual rendering is that it captures the full experience of a user with the\nsame abstraction for all applications. This new abstraction opens new\nopportunities (e.g., the possibility of end-to-end deep learning models that\ninfer QoE directly from a visual rendering) but it also gives rise to new\nresearch challenges (e.g., how to emulate the effect on visual rendering of an\napplication decision). This paper makes the case for visual rendering as a\nunifying abstraction for Internet QoE and outlines a new research agenda to\nunleash its opportunities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 13:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

In this\npaper we explore the possibility of operating a conjugate homodyne detection\nsystem in \"photon counting\" mode to implement discrete-variable (DV) quantum\nkey distribution (QKD) protocols. A conjugate homodyne detection system, which\nconsists of a beam splitter followed by two optical homodyne detectors, can\nsimultaneously measure a pair of conjugate quadratures X and P of the incoming\nquantum state. In classical electrodynamics, X^2 + P^2 is proportional to the\nenergy (the photon number) of the input light. In quantum optics, X and P do\nnot commute and thus the above photon-number measurement is intrinsically\nnoisy. This suggests that a blind application of the standard security proof\ncould result pessimistic QKD performance. We overcome this obstacle by taking\nadvantage of two special features of the proposed detection scheme. First, the\nfundamental detection noise associated with vacuum fluctuation cannot be\nmanipulated by an external adversary. Second, the ability to reconstruct the\nphoton number statistics at the receiver's end can place additional constraints\non possible attacks from the adversary. As an example, we study the security of\nthe BB84 QKD using conjugate homodyne detection and evaluate its performance\nthrough numerical simulations.

As a third\napproach, the surrogate model is re-trained during the optimization. This\nensures a solution quality comparable to the one obtained with the first\napproach while also providing an order of magnitude speedup.

For the microlensing of NRP stars, the light curve is not a simple\nmultiplication of the magnification curve and the intrinsic luminosity curve of\nthe source star, unless the effect of finite source size can be ignored. Three\nmain conclusions can be drawn from the simulated light curves. First, for modes\nwith $m\\neq0$ and when the viewing inclination is more nearly pole-on, the\nstellar luminosity towards the observer changes little with pulsation phase. In\nthis case, high-magnification microlensing events are chromatic and can reveal\nthe variability of these source stars. Second, some combinations of pulsation\nmodes produce nearly degenerate luminosity curves (e.g., (l,m)=(3,0), (5,0)).\nThe resulting microlensing light curves are also degenerate, unless the lens\ncrosses the projected source. Finally, for modes involving m=1, the stellar\nbrightness centre does not coincide with the coordinate centre, and the\nprojected source brightness centre moves in the sky with pulsation phase. As a\nresult of this time-dependent displacement in the brightness centroid, the time\nof the magnification peak coincides with the closest approach of the lens to\nthe brightness centre as opposed to the source coordinate centre.

Developers usually seek solutions to addressing these SVs on developer\nQuestion and Answer (Q&A) websites. However, there is still little known about\non-going SV-specific discussions on different developer Q&A sites. Objective:\nWe present a large-scale empirical study to understand developers' SV\ndiscussions and how these discussions are being supported by Q&A sites. Method:\nWe first curate 71,329 SV posts from two large Q&A sites, namely Stack Overflow\n(SO) and Security StackExchange (SSE). We then use topic modeling to uncover\nthe topics of SV-related discussions and analyze the popularity, difficulty,\nand level of expertise for each topic. We also perform a qualitative analysis\nto identify the types of solutions to SV-related questions. Results: We\nidentify 13 main SV discussion topics on Q&A sites. Many topics do not follow\nthe distributions and trends in expert-based security sources such as Common\nWeakness Enumeration (CWE) and Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).\nWe also discover that SV discussions attract more experts to answer than many\nother domains, but some difficult SV topics (e.g., Vulnerability Scanning\nTools) still receive quite limited support from experts. Moreover, we identify\nseven key types of answers given to SV questions on Q&A sites, in which SO\noften provides code and instructions, while SSE usually gives experience-based\nadvice and explanations. Conclusion: Our findings provide support for\nresearchers and practitioners to effectively acquire, share and leverage SV\nknowledge on Q&A sites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 14:58:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 13:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

Combining HIN and recommender\nsystems can not only help model user behaviors but also make the recommendation\nresults explainable by aligning the users/items with various types of entities\nin the network. Over the past few years, path-based reasoning models have shown\ngreat capacity in HIN-based recommendation. The basic idea of these models is\nto explore HIN with predefined path schemes. Despite their effectiveness, these\nmodels are often confronted with the following limitations: (1) Most prior\npath-based reasoning models only consider the influence of the predecessors on\nthe subsequent nodes when modeling the sequences, and ignore the reciprocity\nbetween the nodes in a path; (2) The weights of nodes in the same path instance\nare usually assumed to be constant, whereas varied weights of nodes can bring\nmore flexibility and lead to expressive modeling; (3) User-item interactions\nare noisy, but they are often indiscriminately exploited. To overcome the\naforementioned issues, in this paper, we propose a novel path-based reasoning\napproach for recommendation over HIN. Concretely, we use a bidirectional LSTM\nto enable the two-way modeling of paths and capture the reciprocity between\nnodes. Then an attention mechanism is employed to learn the dynamical influence\nof nodes in different contexts. Finally, the adversarial regularization terms\nare imposed on the loss function of the model to mitigate the effects of noise\nand enhance HIN-based recommendation.

In heavy-ion collisions, the hydrodynamic expansion of the\nQuark-Gluon Plasma is one of the possible explanations of the origin of the\nridge signal. Measurements in the $e^+e^-$ collision system, without the\ncomplexities introduced by hadron structure in the initial state, can serve as\na complementary probe to examine the formation of a ridge signal. The first\nmeasurement of two-particle angular correlation functions in high multiplicity\n$e^+e^-$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=10.52$ GeV is reported. The hadronic $e^+e^-$\nannihilation data collected by the Belle detector at KEKB are used in this\nstudy. Two-particle angular correlation functions are measured over the full\nazimuth and large pseudorapidity intervals which are defined by either the\nelectron beam axis or the event thrust as a function of charged particle\nmultiplicity. The measurement in the event thrust analysis, with mostly\noutgoing quark pairs determining the reference axis, is sensitive to the region\nof additional soft gluon emissions. No significant ridge signal is observed\nwith either coordinates analyses. Near side jet correlations appear to be\nabsent in the thrust axis analysis. The measurements are compared to\npredictions from various event generators and expected to provide new\nconstraints to the phenomenological models in the low energy regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 15:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

Surprisingly, the confinement effects are\nfound to be much less pronounced in granular aggregates as opposed to porous\nstructures. We show that this discrepancy can be understood in terms of the\nsurface-surface correlation length with a connected path through the fluid\ndomain, suggesting that this length captures the true degree of confinement. We\nalso find that the liquid-gas phase transition in these porous materials is of\nsecond order nature near capillary critical temperature, which is shown to\nrepresent a true critical temperature, i.e. independent of the degree of\ndisorder and the nature of solid matrix, discrete or continuous. The critical\nexponents estimated here from finite-size scaling analysis suggest that this\ntransition belongs to the 3D random field Ising model universality class as\nhypothesized by P.G. de Gennes, with the underlying random fields induced by\nlocal disorder in fluid-solid interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 15:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

In particular, huge gauge redundancies of a\ngravitational theory at the nonperturbative level, which are much larger than\nthe standard diffeomorphism and relate even spaces with different topologies,\nallow us to take different descriptions of a system. While the physical\nconclusions are the same in any description, the same physics may manifest\nitself in vastly different forms in descriptions based on different gauge\nchoices.\n  In this paper, we explore the relation between two such descriptions, which\nwe refer to as the global gauge and unitary gauge constructions. The former is\nbased on the global spacetime of general relativity, in which understanding\nunitarity requires the inclusion of subtle nonperturbative effects of gravity.\nThe latter is based on a distant view of the black hole, in which unitarity is\nmanifest but the existence of interior spacetime is obscured. These two\ndescriptions are complementary. In this paper, we initiate the study of\nlearning aspects of one construction through the analysis of the other.\n  We find that the existence of near empty interior spacetime manifest in the\nglobal gauge construction is related to the maximally chaotic, fast scrambling,\nand universal dynamics of the horizon in the unitary gauge construction. We use\nthe complementarity of the gauge choices to understand the ensemble nature of\nthe gravitational path integral in global spacetime in terms of coarse graining\nand thermality in a single unitary theory that does not involve any ensemble\nnature at the fundamental level. We also discuss how the interior degrees of\nfreedom are related with those in the exterior in the two constructions. This\nrelation emerges most naturally as entanglement wedge reconstruction and the\neffective theory of the interior in the respective constructions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 15:42:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 23:08:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

A large fraction of transneptunian objects are found in binary\npairs, ~30% in the cold classical population between $a_\\text{hel}$~39 and ~48\nAU. Observationally, these binaries generally have components of similar size\nand colour. Previous work has shown that gravitational collapse of a pebble\ncloud is an efficient mechanism for producing such systems. Since the discovery\nof the bi-lobate nature of Arrokoth there is also interest in gravitational\ncollapse as a way to form contact binaries.\n  Aims. Our aim was to investigate formation of binary systems via\ngravitational collapse, considering a wider range of binary masses than\nprevious studies. We analysed in detail the properties of the bound systems\nthat are formed and compared them to observations.\n  Methods. We performed N-body simulations of gravitational collapse of a\npebble cloud using the REBOUND package, with an integrator designed for\nrotating reference frames and robust collision detection. We conducted a deep\nsearch for gravitationally bound particles at the end of the gravitational\ncollapse phase and tested their stability. For all systems produced, not just\nthe most massive binaries, we investigated the population characteristics of\ntheir mass and orbital parameters. Gravitational collapse can create binary\nsystems analogous to Arrokoth and collisions in a collapsing cloud should be\ngentle enough to preserve a bi-lobed structure.\n  Results. Gravitational collapse is an efficient producer of bound\nplanetesimal systems. On average ~1.5 bound systems were produced per cloud in\nthe mass range studied here. As well as the large equal-sized binaries, we\nfound that gravitational collapse produces massive bodies with small satellites\nand low mass binaries with a high mass ratio. Our results disfavour the\ncollapse of high mass clouds, in line with reported upper mass limits of clouds\nformed by the streaming instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 15:46:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 10:14:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 15:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

Results were compared to consolidated\nreference implementations created after the challenge, accounting for the two\nmost common programming languages used in the submissions (Matlab/Python).\n  Results: Visually, differences between submissions were small. Pixel-wise\ndifferences originated from image orientation, assumed field-of-view or\nresolution.

It consists of a large\n2D array of (semi-)passive scattering elements that control the electromagnetic\nproperties of radio-frequency waves so that the reflected signals add\ncoherently at the intended receiver or destructively to reduce co-channel\ninterference. The promised gains of IRS-assisted communications depend on the\naccuracy of the channel state information.

The common feature of both methods is the\ndecoupling of the estimates of the involved MIMO channel matrices (base\nstation-IRS and IRS-user terminal), which provides performance enhancements in\ncomparison to competing methods that are based on unstructured LS estimates of\nthe cascaded channel. Design recommendations for both methods that guide the\nchoice of the system parameters are discussed.

Initially, the study evaluates the\nperformance of the proposed model formulation using experimental datasets\ncollected from two ring-road bicycle experiments; one conducted in Germany in\n2012, and the second in China in 2016. The validation of the model is achieved\nthrough investigating and comparing the proposed model outputs against those\nobtained from two state-of-the-art models, namely: the Necessary Deceleration\nModel (NDM), which is a model specifically designed to capture the longitudinal\nmotion of bicyclists; and the Intelligent Driver Model, which is a\ncar-following model that was demonstrated to be suitable for single-file\nbicycle traffic. Through a quantitative and qualitative evaluation, the\nproposed model formulation is demonstrated to produce modeling errors that are\nconsistent with the other two models. While all three models generate\ntrajectories that are consistent with empirically observed bicycle-following\nbehavior, only the proposed model allows for an explicit and straightforward\ntuning of the bicyclist physical characteristics and the road environment.
