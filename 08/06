Nonlinear medium response can be\nviewed in many perspectives, such as, memory response from the medium, whereby,\nthe medium \"remembers\" earlier influences; reactive responses, whereby, the\nmedium is actively responsive to input, such as, chemical reactivity,\nturbulence and many other circumstances; these equations arise often in the\nbiological sciences when modeling population dynamics, whether the population\nbe genomic, such as, alleles, or animal species in the environment; finally,\nthese sets of equations are often employed to model neurological responses from\nexcitable cellular media.

Here, we report\non the electron spin resonance (ESR) properties of CrCl3 and CrI3 single\ncrystals upon photo-excitation in the visible range. We noticed remarkable\nchanges in the ESR spectra upon illumination. In the case of CrCl3, at 10 K,\nthe ESR signal is shifted from g = 1.492 (dark) to 1.661 (light), line width\nincreased from 376 to 506 Oe, and the signal intensity is reduced by 1.5 times.\nMost interestingly, the observed change in the signal intensity is reversible\nwhen the light is cycled on/off. We observed almost no change in the ESR\nspectral parameters in the paramagnetic phase (>20 K) upon illumination. Upon\nphoto-excitation of CrI3, the ESR signal intensity is reduced by 1.9 times; the\ng-value increased from 1.956 to 1.990; the linewidth increased from 1170 to\n1260 Oe at 60 K. These findings are discussed by taking into account the skin\ndepth, the slow relaxation mechanism and the appearance of low-symmetry fields\nat the photo-generated Cr2+ Jahn-Teller centers.

In this paper, a new method to analyze RTPCA is\nproposed based on the recently developed tensor-tensor product and tensor\nsingular value decomposition (t-SVD). Specifically, it aims to solve a convex\noptimization problem whose objective function is a weighted combination of the\ntensor nuclear norm and the l1-norm. In most of literature of RTPCA, the exact\nrecovery is built on the tensor incoherence conditions and the assumption of a\nuniform model on the sparse support. Unlike this conventional way, in this\npaper, without any assumption of randomness, the exact recovery can be achieved\nin a completely deterministic fashion by characterizing the tensor\nrank-sparsity incoherence, which is an uncertainty principle between the\nlow-rank tensor spaces and the pattern of sparse tensor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2020 16:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-06"}

Recent\nresearch has demonstrated the added prognosis value that becomes available by\nusing the AFB as compared with the binary diagnosis. We evaluate, for the first\ntime, the ability to estimate the AFB over long-term continuous recordings,\nusing a deep recurrent neutral network (DRNN) approach. Methods: The models\nwere developed and evaluated on a large database of p=2,891 patients, totaling\nt=68,800 hours of continuous electrocardiography (ECG) recordings acquired at\nthe University of Virginia heart station. Specifically, 24h beat-to-beat time\nseries were obtained from a single portable ECG channel. The network, denoted\nArNet, was benchmarked against a gradient boosting (XGB) model, trained on 21\nfeatures including the coefficient of sample entropy (CosEn) and AFEvidence.\nData were divided into training and test sets, while patients were stratified\nby the presence and severity of AF. The generalizations of ArNet and XGB were\nalso evaluated on the independent test PhysioNet LTAF database. Results: the\nabsolute AF burden estimation error |E_AF|, median and interquartile, on the\ntest set, was 1.2 (0.1-6.7) for ArNet and 3.1 (0.0-11.7) for XGB for AF\nindividuals.

Unlike flatbed scanners, photographed\ndocuments are often folded and crumpled, resulting in large local variance in\ntext structure. The problem of document rectification is fundamental to the\nOptical Character Recognition (OCR) process on documents, and its ability to\novercome geometric distortions significantly affects recognition accuracy.\nDespite the great progress in recent OCR systems, most still rely on a\npre-process that ensures the text lines are straight and axis aligned. Recent\nworks have tackled the problem of rectifying document images taken in-the-wild\nusing various supervision signals and alignment means. However, they focused on\nglobal features that can be extracted from the document's boundaries, ignoring\nvarious signals that could be obtained from the document's content.\n  We present CREASE: Content Aware Rectification using Angle Supervision, the\nfirst learned method for document rectification that relies on the document's\ncontent, the location of the words and specifically their orientation, as hints\nto assist in the rectification process. We utilize a novel pixel-wise angle\nregression approach and a curvature estimation side-task for optimizing our\nrectification model.

Methods:\nQuantification and localization of different adipose tissue compartments from\nwhole-body MR images is of high interest to examine metabolic conditions. For\ncorrect identification and phenotyping of individuals at increased risk for\nmetabolic diseases, a reliable automatic segmentation of adipose tissue into\nsubcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue is required. In this work we propose a\n3D convolutional neural network (DCNet) to provide a robust and objective\nsegmentation. In this retrospective study, we collected 1000 cases (66$\\pm$ 13\nyears; 523 women) from the Tuebingen Family Study and from the German Center\nfor Diabetes research (TUEF/DZD), as well as 300 cases (53$\\pm$ 11 years; 152\nwomen) from the German National Cohort (NAKO) database for model training,\nvalidation, and testing with a transfer learning between the cohorts. These\ndatasets had variable imaging sequences, imaging contrasts, receiver coil\narrangements, scanners and imaging field strengths. The proposed DCNet was\ncompared against a comparable 3D UNet segmentation in terms of sensitivity,\nspecificity, precision, accuracy, and Dice overlap. Results: Fast (5-7seconds)\nand reliable adipose tissue segmentation can be obtained with high Dice overlap\n(0.94), sensitivity (96.6%), specificity (95.1%), precision (92.1%) and\naccuracy (98.4%) from 3D whole-body MR datasets (field of view coverage\n450x450x2000mm${}^3$).

We build on previous work where it was shown that the spectra of\ncertain operators derived from the causal matrix possess considerable but not\ncomplete power to distinguish causal sets. We find two especially successful\nmethods for classifying causal sets and we computationally test them for all\ncausal sets of up to $9$ elements. One of the spectral geometric methods that\nwe study involves holding a given causal set fixed and collecting a growing set\nof its geometric invariants such as spectra (including the spectra of the\ncommutator of certain operators). The second method involves obtaining a\nlimited set of geometric invariants for a given causal set while also\ncollecting these geometric invariants for small `perturbations' of the causal\nset, a novel method that may also be useful in other areas of spectral\ngeometry.

We pursue this\ncorrespondence in two directions. First, beginning with a general disk\nintegrand dressed with a Koba-Nielsen factor, we demonstrate that exchange\nsymmetry for the factorization residue of the amplitude forces the integrand to\nbe expandable on SL(2,R) conformal blocks. Furthermore, positivity constraints\nassociated with unitarity imply the SL(2,R) blocks must come in linear\ncombinations for which the Virasoro block emerges at the \"kink\" in the space of\nsolutions. In other words, Virasoro symmetry arises at the boundary of\nconsistent factorization. Next, we consider the low energy EFT description,\nwhere unitarity manifests as the EFThedron in which the couplings must live.\nThe existence of a worldsheet description implies, through the Koba-Nielsen\nfactor, monodromy relations which impose algebraic identities amongst the EFT\ncouplings. We demonstrate at finite derivative order that the intersection of\nthe \"monodromy plane\" and the EFThedron carves out a tiny island for the\ncouplings, which continues to shrink as the derivative order is increased. At\nthe eighth derivative order, on a three-dimensional monodromy plane, the\nintersection fixes the width of this island to around 1.5$\\%$ (of $\\zeta(3)$)\nand 0.2$\\%$ (of $\\zeta(5)$) with respect to the super string answer.

We study a common tool in the designer's toolkit: conceptual\nmetaphors. Metaphors can present an agent as akin to a wry teenager, a toddler,\nor an experienced butler. How might a choice of metaphor influence our\nexperience of the AI agent? Sampling metaphors along the dimensions of warmth\nand competence---defined by psychological theories as the primary axes of\nvariation for human social perception---we perform a study (N=260) where we\nmanipulate the metaphor, but not the behavior, of a Wizard-of-Oz conversational\nagent. Following the experience, participants are surveyed about their\nintention to use the agent, their desire to cooperate with the agent, and the\nagent's usability. Contrary to the current tendency of designers to use high\ncompetence metaphors to describe AI products, we find that metaphors that\nsignal low competence lead to better evaluations of the agent than metaphors\nthat signal high competence. This effect persists despite both high and low\ncompetence agents featuring human-level performance and the wizards being blind\nto condition. A second study confirms that intention to adopt decreases rapidly\nas competence projected by the metaphor increases. In a third study, we assess\neffects of metaphor choices on potential users' desire to try out the system\nand find that users are drawn to systems that project higher competence and\nwarmth. These results suggest that projecting competence may help attract new\nusers, but those users may discard the agent unless it can quickly correct with\na lower competence metaphor. We close with a retrospective analysis that finds\nsimilar patterns between metaphors and user attitudes towards past\nconversational agents such as Xiaoice, Replika, Woebot, Mitsuku, and Tay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2020 18:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-07"}

We use\ninelastic neutron scattering to study spin waves in uniaxial pressure-detwinned\nNaFeAs.

On the other hand, real ballot polling\naudits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop\n(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant\ninefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA\nclass of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round\nschedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins).

This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing\nballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without\ninformation on selection order. These results are significant because current\napproaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,\nrequiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials.

In the 1960s, this\ncounterintuitive phenomenon was rediscovered as the statement that \"hot water\ncan freeze faster than cold water\" and has become known as the Mpemba effect;\nit has since been the subject of much experimental investigation and some\ncontroversy.

The first author and Trakuldit showed that if it\nfails by at most a constant amount, then the group is in fact automatic. In\nthis article we show that for a large class of non-automatic Cayley automatic\ngroups this function is bounded below by a linear function in a precise sense\ndefined herein. In fact, for all Cayley automatic groups which have\nsuper-quadratic Dehn function, or which are not finitely presented, we can\nconstruct a non-decreasing function which (1) depends only on the group and (2)\nbounds from below the distance function for any Cayley automatic structure on\nthe group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2020 22:08:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 06:25:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 01:51:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 00:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

Optimization fabrics can encode\ncommonalities among optimization problems that reflect the structure of the\nspace itself, enabling smooth optimization processes to intelligently navigate\neach problem even when optimizing simple naive potential functions.\nImportantly, optimization over a fabric is inherently asymptotically stable.\nThe majority of this paper is dedicated to the development of a tool set for\nthe design and use of a broad class of fabrics called geometric fabrics.\nGeometric fabrics encode behavior as general nonlinear geometries which are\ncovariant second-order differential equations with a special homogeneity\nproperty that ensures their behavior is independent of the system's speed\nthrough the medium. A class of Finsler Lagrangian energies can be used to both\ndefine how these nonlinear geometries combine with one another and how they\nreact when potential functions force them from their nominal paths.\nFurthermore, these geometric fabrics are closed under the standard operations\nof pullback and combination on a transform tree. For behavior representation,\nthis class of geometric fabrics constitutes a broad class of spectral\nsemi-sprays (specs), also known as Riemannian Motion Policies (RMPs) in the\ncontext of robotic motion generation, that captures both the intuitive\nseparation between acceleration policy and priority metric critical for modular\ndesign and are inherently stable. Therefore, geometric fabrics are safe and\neasier to use by less experienced behavioral designers.

The computations in DNN realized by analog\nNVM thus have high uncertainty due to the device stochasticity. Several reports\nhave demonstrated the use of analog NVM for CIM in a limited scale. It is\nunclear whether the uncertainties in computations will prohibit large-scale\nDNNs. To explore this critical issue of scalability, this paper first presents\na simulation framework to evaluate the feasibility of large-scale DNNs based on\nCIM architecture and analog NVM. Simulation results show that DNNs trained for\nhigh-precision digital computing engines are not resilient against the\nuncertainty of the analog NVM devices. To avoid such catastrophic failures,\nthis paper introduces the analog floating-point representation for the DNN, and\nthe Hessian-Aware Stochastic Gradient Descent (HA-SGD) training algorithm to\nenhance the inference accuracy of trained DNNs.

In this paper, we propose a\nFine-grained Iterative Attention Network (FIAN) that consists of an iterative\nattention module for bilateral query-video in-formation extraction.\nSpecifically, in the iterative attention module, each word in the query is\nfirst enhanced by attending to each frame in the video through fine-grained\nattention, then video iteratively attends to the integrated query. Finally,\nboth video and query information is utilized to provide robust cross-modal\nrepresentation for further moment localization.

Nevertheless, their ability in\nmodeling relations between samples remains limited. Beyond the limitations of\ngrid sampling, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been recently proposed\nand successfully applied in irregular (or non-grid) data representation and\nanalysis. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate CNNs and GCNs (qualitatively\nand quantitatively) in terms of HS image classification. Due to the\nconstruction of the adjacency matrix on all the data, traditional GCNs usually\nsuffer from a huge computational cost, particularly in large-scale remote\nsensing (RS) problems. To this end, we develop a new mini-batch GCN (called\nminiGCN hereinafter) which allows to train large-scale GCNs in a mini-batch\nfashion. More significantly, our miniGCN is capable of inferring out-of-sample\ndata without re-training networks and improving classification performance.\nFurthermore, as CNNs and GCNs can extract different types of HS features, an\nintuitive solution to break the performance bottleneck of a single model is to\nfuse them. Since miniGCNs can perform batch-wise network training (enabling the\ncombination of CNNs and GCNs) we explore three fusion strategies: additive\nfusion, element-wise multiplicative fusion, and concatenation fusion to measure\nthe obtained performance gain. Extensive experiments, conducted on three HS\ndatasets, demonstrate the advantages of miniGCNs over GCNs and the superiority\nof the tested fusion strategies with regards to the single CNN or GCN models.\nThe codes of this work will be available at\nhttps://github.com/danfenghong/IEEE_TGRS_GCN for the sake of reproducibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 05:01:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 00:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

To be specific, we devise a\nsimple and efficient meta-reweighting strategy to adapt the sample\nrepresentations and generate soft attention to refine the representation such\nthat the relevant features from the query and support samples can be extracted\nfor a better few-shot classification. Such an adaptive attention model is also\nable to explain what the classification model is looking for as the evidence\nfor classification to some extent.

However, they introduce new problems at the same time. Due to the\nautoregressive nature, the time cost of inference has to be proportional to the\nlength of text, which pose a great challenge for online serving. On the other\nhand, the style of synthetic speech becomes unstable and may change obviously\namong sentences. In this paper, we propose a Phrase based Parallel End-to-End\nTTS System (PPSpeech) to address these issues. PPSpeech uses autoregression\napproach within a phrase and executes parallel strategies for different\nphrases. By this method, we can achieve both high quality and high efficiency.\nIn addition, we propose acoustic embedding and text context embedding as the\nconditions of encoder to keep successive and prevent from abrupt style or\ntimbre change. Experiments show that, the synthesis speed of PPSpeech is much\nfaster than sentence level autoregressive Tacotron 2 when a sentence has more\nthan 5 phrases. The speed advantage increases with the growth of sentence\nlength.

Given the coarse-grained\nmodeling in theories of fluids, considerable uncertainties may exist between\nflow-field solutions and real-world physics. To study the emergence,\npropagation and evolution of uncertainties from molecular to hydrodynamic level\nposes great opportunities and challenges to develop both sound theories and\nreliable multi-scale algorithms. In this paper, we study the stochastic\nbehavior of multi-scale gas dynamic systems, especially focusing on the\nnon-equilibrium effects. The theoretical analysis is presented on the basis of\nkinetic model equation and its upscaling macroscopic system, with the\nreformulation from the stochastic Galerkin method. A newly developed stochastic\nkinetic scheme is employed to conduct numerical simulation of homogeneous\nrelaxation, normal shock structure, shear layer and lid-driven cavity problems.\nDifferent kinds of uncertainties are involved in conjunction with the gas\nevolutionary processes. New physical observations, such as the synergistic\npropagation pattern between mean fields and uncertainties, sensitivity of\ndifferent orders of uncertainties, and the influence of boundary effects from\ncontinuum to rarefied regimes, will be identified and analyzed theoretically.\nThe paper serves as a heuristic study of quantifying the uncertainties within\nmulti-scale flow dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 07:55:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-07"}

In a stably stratified Boussinesq fluid, this irreversible mixing\ndescribes the conversion of available potential energy (APE) to background\npotential energy (BPE).

However, existing methods for\nlipreading mainly build on autoregressive (AR) model, which generate target\ntokens one by one and suffer from high inference latency. To breakthrough this\nconstraint, we propose FastLR, a non-autoregressive (NAR) lipreading model\nwhich generates all target tokens simultaneously. NAR lipreading is a\nchallenging task that has many difficulties: 1) the discrepancy of sequence\nlengths between source and target makes it difficult to estimate the length of\nthe output sequence; 2) the conditionally independent behavior of NAR\ngeneration lacks the correlation across time which leads to a poor\napproximation of target distribution; 3) the feature representation ability of\nencoder can be weak due to lack of effective alignment mechanism; and 4) the\nremoval of AR language model exacerbates the inherent ambiguity problem of\nlipreading. Thus, in this paper, we introduce three methods to reduce the gap\nbetween FastLR and AR model: 1) to address challenges 1 and 2, we leverage\nintegrate-and-fire (I\\&F) module to model the correspondence between source\nvideo frames and output text sequence. 2) To tackle challenge 3, we add an\nauxiliary connectionist temporal classification (CTC) decoder to the top of the\nencoder and optimize it with extra CTC loss.

However, it is difficult to attain high bandwidth\nutilization in cloud computing due to the complex and distributed natures of\ncloud computing resources. Recently, a growing demand for multicast\ntransmission is perceived in cloud computing, due to the explosive growth of\nmulti-point communication applications, such as video conferencing, online\ngaming, etc. Nonetheless, the inherent complexity in multicast routing in cloud\ncomputing, existing multicast plans failed to produce effective and efficient\nprotocol schemes, which limits the application of multicast communication on\nthe Internet. In this paper, a technique is proposed in how the newly developed\nnetwork architecture, Software Defined Network (SDN), can promote the design of\nthe multicast protocol and improve the performance of the multicast\ntransmission in the cloud computing. The approach is to use the SDN-cloud\nComputing-enabled multicast communication scheme with ultra-high bandwidth\nutilization. The bandwidth utilization is enhanced by measuring various routing\ntrees for each multicast transmission session and distributing the traffic load\nover all available routes in the cloud computing resources. The SDN is utilized\nto tackle with various design hurdles in the cloud computing, including both\nthe current ones with the conventional multicast pattern and the newly emerged\nones with multi-tree multicast.

Here we systematically investigated the terahertz radiation from\ntopological insulator Bi2Te3 nanofilms driven by femtosecond laser pulses, and\nsuccessfully realized the generation of efficient chiral terahertz waves with\ncontrollable chirality, ellipticity, and principle axis. The convenient\nengineering of the chiral terahertz waves was interpreted by photogalvanic\neffect induced photocurrent, while the linearly polarized terahertz waves\noriginated from linear photogalvanic effect induced shift currents. We believe\nour works not only help further understanding femtosecond coherent control of\nultrafast spin currents in light-matter interaction but also provide an\neffective way to generate spin-polarized terahertz waves and accelerate the\nproliferation of twisting the terahertz waves at the source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 09:18:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-07"}

Studying the\ntopological phase diagram reveals two branches of the non trivial topological\nphase -- a main branch, which is typical for Rashba nanowires, and an\nadditional branch emerging due to the antiferromagnetic order. In the case of\nthe additional topological branch, Majorana bound states can also exist close\nto half-filling, obviating the need for either doping or gating the nanowire to\nreach the low density regime. Moreover, we show the emergence of the Majorana\nbound states in the absence of the external magnetic field, which is possible\ndue to the antiferromagnetic order.

Their theoretical\nunderstanding is hampered by their large Hilbert space and by their intrinsic\nnonequilibrium nature, limiting the applicability of many traditional\napproaches. In this work we extend the nonequilibrium bosonic Dynamical Mean\nField Theory (DMFT) to Markovian open quantum systems. Within DMFT, a Lindblad\nmaster equation describing a lattice of dissipative bosonic particles is mapped\nonto an impurity problem describing a single site embedded in its Markovian\nenvironment and coupled to a self-consistent field and to a non-Markovian bath,\nwhere the latter accounts for finite lattice connectivity corrections beyond\nGutzwiller mean-field theory. We develop a non-perturbative approach to solve\nthis bosonic impurity problem, which treats the non-Markovian bath in a\nnon-crossing approximation. As a first application, we address the steady-state\nof a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model with two-body losses and incoherent\npump. We show that DMFT captures hopping-induced dissipative processes,\ncompletely missed in Gutzwiller mean-field theory, which crucially determine\nthe properties of the normal phase, including the redistribution of\nsteady-state populations, the suppression of local gain and the emergence of a\nstationary quantum-Zeno regime. We argue that these processes compete with\ncoherent hopping to determine the phase transition towards a non-equilibrium\nsuperfluid, leading to a strong renormalization of the phase boundary at\nfinite-connectivity. We show that this transition occurs as a finite-frequency\ninstability, leading to an oscillating-in-time order parameter, that we connect\nwith a quantum many-body synchronization transition of an array of quantum van\nder Pol oscillators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 10:35:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 10:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

The size of\ncarry changes with the number of operands and hence a reliable algorithm to\nestimate exact number of carry bits is needed for optimal implementation of a\nreconfigurable multi-operand adder. A combinatorial multi-operand adder can be\nfaster compared to a sequential implementation using a two operand adder. Use\ncases for such adders occur in modern processors for deep neural networks. Such\nprocessors require massively parallel computing resources on chip. This paper\npresents a method to estimate the upper bound on the size of carry. A method to\ncompute the exact number of carry bits required for a multi-operand addition\noperation. A fast combinatorial parallel 4-operand adder module is presented.\nAn algorithm to reconfigure these adder modules to implement larger adders is\nalso described. Further, the paper presents two compact but slower iterative\nstructures that implement multi-operand addition, iterating with one column at\na time till the entire word is covered. Such serial/iterative operations are\nslow but occupy small space while parallel operations are fast but use large\nsilicon area on chip. Interestingly, the area-to-throughput ratio of two\narchitectures can tilt in favor of slower, smaller and large number units\ninstead of the fewer numbers of fast and large compute units.

However, while MCMCP has strong asymptotic properties, its\nbinary choice paradigm generates relatively little information per trial, and\nits local proposal function makes it slow to explore the parameter space and\nfind the modes of the distribution. Here we therefore generalize MCMCP to a\ncontinuous-sampling paradigm, where in each iteration the participant uses a\nslider to continuously manipulate a single stimulus dimension to optimize a\ngiven criterion such as 'pleasantness'. We formulate both methods from a\nutility-theory perspective, and show that the new method can be interpreted as\n'Gibbs Sampling with People' (GSP). Further, we introduce an aggregation\nparameter to the transition step, and show that this parameter can be\nmanipulated to flexibly shift between Gibbs sampling and deterministic\noptimization. In an initial study, we show GSP clearly outperforming MCMCP; we\nthen show that GSP provides novel and interpretable results in three other\ndomains, namely musical chords, vocal emotions, and faces. We validate these\nresults through large-scale perceptual rating experiments.

In light of the capabilities\ndemonstrated by deep learning methods over the past years across a variety of\nfields, including medical imaging, it is natural to consider their ability to\nrecover high-quality ultrasound images from partial data. Here, we propose an\napproach for deep-learning based reconstruction of B-mode images from\ntemporally and spatially sub-sampled channel data. We begin by considering\nsub-Nyquist sampled data, time-aligned in the frequency domain and transformed\nback to the time domain. The data is further sampled spatially, so that only a\nsubset of the received signals is acquired. The partial data is used to train\nan encoder-decoder convolutional neural network, using as targets\nminimum-variance (MV) beamformed signals that were generated from the original,\nfully-sampled data. Our approach yields high-quality B-mode images, with higher\nresolution than previously proposed reconstruction approaches (NESTA) from\ncompressed data as well as delay-and-sum beamforming (DAS) of the fully-sampled\ndata.

In this work,\nwe propose a novel multiscale formulation for XFEM, based on locally computed\nbasis functions. The local multiscale basis functions capture the heterogeneity\nand discontinuities introduced by fractures. Local boundary conditions are set\nto follow a reduced-dimensional system, in order to preserve the accuracy of\nthe basis functions. Using these multiscale bases, a multiscale coarse-scale\nsystem is then governed algebraically and solved, in which no enrichment due to\nthe fractures exist. Such formulation allows for significant computational cost\nreduction, at the same time, it preserves the accuracy of the discrete\ndisplacement vector space. The coarse-scale solution is finally interpolated\nback to the fine scale system, using the same multiscale basis functions. The\nproposed multiscale XFEM (MS-XFEM) is also integrated within a two-stage\nalgebraic iterative solver, through which error reduction to any desired level\ncan be achieved. Several proof-of-concept numerical tests are presented to\nassess the performance of the developed method. It is shown that the MS-XFEM is\naccurate, when compared with the fine-scale reference XFEM solutions. At the\nsame time, it is significantly more efficient than the XFEM on fine-scale\nresolution.

Our\ntheoretical calculations suggest that Cu's activity arises from the\nadvantageous combination of simultaneous *OH adsorption under CO oxidation\npotentials and surmountable *CO-*OH coupling barriers. Experimentally observed\nonset potentials are in agreement with the computed onsets of *OH adsorption.\nWe furthermore show that the onsets of *OH adsorption on steps are more\naffected by *CO-*OH interactions than on terraces due to a stronger competitive\nadsorption. Overall, Cu(100) shows the lowest overpotential (0.03 V) of the\nfacets considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 14:05:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 07:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

To investigate the role of acoustic and magneto-acoustic waves in\nheating the solar chromosphere, observations in strong chromospheric lines are\nanalyzed by comparing the deposited acoustic-energy flux with the total\nintegrated radiative losses.\n  Methods.

In the middle chromosphere (h = 1000-1400 km), the radiative losses\ncan be fully balanced by the deposited acoustic energy flux in a quiet-Sun\nregion.

The acoustic energy flux is efficiently deposited in the middle\nchromosphere, where the density of gas is sufficiently high. About 90% of the\navailable acoustic energy flux in the quiet-Sun region is deposited in these\nlayers, and thus it is a major contributor to the radiative losses of the\nmiddle chromosphere.

To address this challenge, new Wi-Fi\nstandards introduce the Target Wake Time (TWT) mechanism. With TWT, devices\ntransmit their data according to a schedule and move to the doze state\nafterwards. The main problem of this mechanism is the clock drift phenomenon,\nbecause of which the devices cease to strictly comply with the schedule. As a\nresult, they can miss the scheduled transmission time, which increases active\ntime and thus power consumption. The paper investigates uplink transmission\nwith two different TWT operation modes. With the first mode, a sensor transmits\na packet to the access point (AP) after waking up, using the random channel\naccess. With the second mode, the AP polls stations and they can transmit a\npacket only after receiving a trigger frame from the AP. For both modes, the\npaper studies how the average transmission time, the packet loss rate and the\naverage energy consumption depend on the different TWT parameters. It is shown\nthat when configured to guarantee the given packet loss rate, the first mode\nprovides lower transmission time, while the second mode provides lower energy\nconsumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 14:58:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-07"}

Despite their prevalence, deep learning models always require a\nmyriad number of densely annotated training images, which are difficult to\nobtain due to extensive labor and associated expert costs related to histology\nimage annotations. In this paper, we propose the pairwise relation-based\nsemi-supervised (PRS^2) model for gland segmentation on histology images. This\nmodel consists of a segmentation network (S-Net) and a pairwise relation\nnetwork (PR-Net). The S-Net is trained on labeled data for segmentation, and\nPR-Net is trained on both labeled and unlabeled data in an unsupervised way to\nenhance its image representation ability via exploiting the semantic\nconsistency between each pair of images in the feature space. Since both\nnetworks share their encoders, the image representation ability learned by\nPR-Net can be transferred to S-Net to improve its segmentation performance. We\nalso design the object-level Dice loss to address the issues caused by touching\nglands and combine it with other two loss functions for S-Net. We evaluated our\nmodel against five recent methods on the GlaS dataset and three recent methods\non the CRAG dataset.

This is a fundamental question for storage and release\nmodels of flares and ARs, yet it is presently poorly answered by observations.\nHere we use the \"Sun-as-a-point-source\" spectra from the EUV Variability\nExperiment (EVE) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to provide a novel\nestimate of radiative energy losses of an evolving active region. Although EVE\nprovides excellent spectral (5-105nm) and temperature (2-25MK) coverage for AR\nanalysis, to our knowledge, these data have not been used for this purpose due\nto the lack of spatial resolution and the likelihood of source confusion. Here\nwe present a way around this problem. We analyze EVE data time series, when\nonly one large AR 11520 was present on the disk. By subtracting the quiet Sun\nbackground, we estimate the radiative contribution in EUV from the AR alone. We\nestimate the mean AR irradiance and cumulative AR radiative energy losses in\nthe 1-300A and astronomical standard ROSAT-PSPC, 3-124A, passbands and compare\nthese to the magnetic energy injection rate through the photosphere, and to\nvariations of the solar cycle luminosity. We find that while AR radiative\nenergy losses are ~100 times smaller than typical magnetic energy injection\nrates at the photosphere, they are an order of magnitude larger or similar to\nthe bolometric radiated energies associated with large flares. This study is\nthe first detailed analysis of AR thermal properties using EVE Sun-as-a-star\nobservations, opening doors to AR studies on other stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 15:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

However, trimmed datasets are manually annotated from\nuntrimmed videos. In this sense, these methods are not really self-supervised.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised method, referred to as\nExploring Relations in Untrimmed Videos (ERUV), which can be straightforwardly\napplied to untrimmed videos (real unlabeled) to learn spatio-temporal features.\nERUV first generates single-shot videos by shot change detection. Then a\ndesigned sampling strategy is used to model relations for video clips. The\nstrategy is saved as our self-supervision signals. Finally, the network learns\nrepresentations by predicting the category of relations between the video\nclips. ERUV is able to compare the differences and similarities of videos,\nwhich is also an essential procedure for action and video related tasks. We\nvalidate our learned models with action recognition and video retrieval tasks\nwith three kinds of 3D CNNs.

Standard concepts for paraxial\npolarization like the degree of polarization, the Stokes parameters and the\nPoincar\\'e sphere then have generalizations for nonparaxial light that are\neither not unique or not trivial.

Zeroing\nNeural Networks (ZNN) were invented for time-varying matrix problems around\n2001 in China and almost all of their advances have been made in and most still\ncome from its birthplace. ZNN methods have become a backbone for solving\ndiscretized sensor driven time-varying matrix problems in real-time, in theory\nand in on-chip applications for robots, in control theory and in engineering in\nChina. They have become the method of choice for many time-varying matrix\nproblems that benefit from or require efficient, accurate and predictive\nreal-time computations. The typical discretized ZNN algorithm needs seven\ndistinct steps for its initial set-up. The construction of discretized ZNN\nalgorithms starts from a model with its associated error equation and the\nstipulation that the error function decrease exponentially fast. The error\nfunction differential equation is then mated with a convergent look-ahead\nfinite difference formula to create a distinctly new multi-step style solver\nthat predicts the future state of the system reliably from current and earlier\nstate and solution data. Matlab codes for discretized ZNN matrix algorithms\ntypically consist of one linear equations solve and one recursion of already\navailable data per time step. This makes discretized ZNN based algorithms\nhighly competitive with ordinary differential equation initial value path\nfollowing or homotopy methods that are designed to work adaptively and gives\nZNN different characteristics and applicabilities from multi-step ODE initial\nvalue solvers that by design cannot be predictive.

Particularly, acute pain is known to be the primary symptom of SCD.\nThe insidious and subjective nature of SCD pain leads to challenges in pain\nassessment among Medical Practitioners (MPs). Thus, accurate identification of\nmarkers of pain in patients with SCD is crucial for pain management.\nClassifying clinical notes of patients with SCD based on their pain level\nenables MPs to give appropriate treatment. We propose a binary classification\nmodel to predict pain relevance of clinical notes and a multiclass\nclassification model to predict pain level. While our four binary machine\nlearning (ML) classifiers are comparable in their performance, Decision Trees\nhad the best performance for the multiclass classification task achieving 0.70\nin F-measure. Our results show the potential clinical text analysis and machine\nlearning offer to pain management in sickle cell patients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2020 23:39:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Their attraction is\ndue in part to the fact that they can represent a general class of methods that\nallow to learn a solution with a reasonably set reward and minimal prior\nknowledge, even in situations where it is difficult or expensive for a human\nexpert. For RL to truly make good on this promise, however, we need algorithms\nand learning setups that can work across a broad range of problems with minimal\nproblem specific adjustments or engineering. In this paper, we study this idea\nof generality in the locomotion domain. We develop a learning framework that\ncan learn sophisticated locomotion behavior for a wide spectrum of legged\nrobots, such as bipeds, tripeds, quadrupeds and hexapods, including wheeled\nvariants. Our learning framework relies on a data-efficient, off-policy\nmulti-task RL algorithm and a small set of reward functions that are\nsemantically identical across robots. To underline the general applicability of\nthe method, we keep the hyper-parameter settings and reward definitions\nconstant across experiments and rely exclusively on on-board sensing. For nine\ndifferent types of robots, including a real-world quadruped robot, we\ndemonstrate that the same algorithm can rapidly learn diverse and reusable\nlocomotion skills without any platform specific adjustments or additional\ninstrumentation of the learning setup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 08:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

In the empirical evaluation, the classification\nperformance of the graphical models was compared with some traditional machine\nlearning classifiers and a recurrent neural network. The datasets used for the\nexperiments were IMDB movie reviews, Amazon Consumer Product reviews, and\nTwitter Review datasets. After this empirical study, we conclude that the\ninclusion of semantics for sentiment analysis tasks can greatly improve the\nperformance of a classifier, as the semantic feature extraction methods reduce\nuncertainties in classification resulting in more accurate predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 11:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

Early COVID-19 outbreaks in Wuhan, China and Lombardy,\nItaly coincided with high levels of air pollution drawing attention to a\npotential role of particulate matter and other pollutants in infections and\nmore severe outcomes of the new lung disease. Both air pollution and COVID-19\noutcomes are driven by human mobility and economic activity leading to spurious\ncorrelations in regression estimates. We use district-level panel data from\nBelgium, Brazil, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the US to estimate the impact of\ndaily variation in air pollution levels on COVID-19 infections and deaths.\nUsing random variation in air pollution generated by thermal inversions, we\nrule out that changes in mobility and economic activity are driving the\nresults. We find that a 1%-increase in air pollution levels over the three\npreceding weeks leads to a 1.5% increase in weekly cases. A 1%-increase in air\npollution over four weeks leads to 5.1% more COVID-19 deaths. These results\nindicate that short-term measures to reduce air pollution can help mitigate the\nhealth damages of the virus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 15:11:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}
