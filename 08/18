The motivation is to provide an alternative to the standard canonical\nquantization based on the Einstein-Hilbert action alone, because the latter\ndoes not generate the quadratic curvature terms in the semiclassical limit. A\nparticular formulation of a semiclassical approximation scheme is employed\nwhich ensures that the effects of the quadratic curvature terms become\nperturbative in the semiclassical limit. This leaves the classical General\nRelativity intact, while naturally giving rise to its first semiclassical\ncorrections. Another topic of interest is a classical theory where the\nquadratic Ricci scalar and the Einstein-Hilbert term are absent from the\naction, which then enjoys the symmetry with respect to the conformal\ntransformation of fields (local Weyl rescaling). We pay a special attention to\nthis case, since it provides a natural setting for the absence of the notion of\na physical length scale. Certain useful model-independent tools are also\nconstructed in this thesis. Firstly, dimensionless coordinates and the\nunimodular decomposition of the metric are used to expose the only conformally\nvariant degree of freedom, making the geometrical origin of the physical length\nscale apparent. With such an approach several earlier results become much more\ntransparent. Secondly, using unimodular-conformal variables a model-independent\ngenerator of conformal field transformations is constructed in terms of which a\nreformulation of the definition of conformal invariance is given. Thirdly, it\nis argued that a canonical quantization scheme makes more sense to be based on\nthe quantization of generators of relevant transformations, than on first class\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 16:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

This unique system is\nsurrounded by a bright emission nebula, likely to be the remnant of a recent\nnova eruption. Embedded within this nebula is a prominent bow-shock, where the\nsystem's accretion disc wind runs into its own nova shell. In order to\nestablish its fundamental properties, we present the first comprehensive\nmulti-wavelength study of the system. Long-term photometry reveals\nquasi-periodic, super-orbital variations with a characteristic time-scale of\n10-16 days and typical amplitude of ~1 mag. High-cadence photometry from TESS\nreveals for the first time both the orbital period and a \"negative superhump\"\nperiod. The latter is usually interpreted as the signature of a tilted\naccretion disc. We propose a recently developed disc instability model as a\nplausible explanation for the photometric behaviour. In our spectroscopic data,\nwe clearly detect anti-phased absorption and emission line components. Their\nradial velocities suggest a high mass ratio, which in turn implies an unusually\nlow white dwarf mass. We also constrain the wind mass-loss rate of the system\nfrom the spatially resolved [O iii] emission produced in the bow-shock; this\ncan be used to test and calibrate accretion disc wind models. We suggest a\npossible association between V341 Ara and a \"guest star\" mentioned in Chinese\nhistorical records in AD1240. If this marks the date of the system's nova\neruption, V341 Ara would be the oldest recovered nova of its class and an\nexcellent laboratory for testing nova theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 16:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

While the first two conditions depend on the\nacyclicity (weak acyclicity) of the union (intersection) of simplified\ntransition graphs, the third condition is based on the distances of each state\nto the absorbing states in all the modes. These graph theoretic conditions can\nverify the stability and stabilizability of absorbing states based only on the\nfeasibility of transitions in each mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 17:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

In this paper, we solve the issue of these \"inflationary stochastic\nanomalies\" by using the Stratonovich discretisation satisfying general\ncovariance, and identifying that the quantum nature of the fluctuating fields\nentails the existence of a preferred frame defining independent stochastic\nnoises. Moreover, we derive physically equivalent It\\^o-Langevin equations that\nare manifestly covariant and well suited for numerical computations.

They are believed to be\nformed when a red giant suffers an extreme mass-loss episode. Binary\ninteraction is suggested to be the main formation channel, but the high\nfraction of apparently single hot subdwarfs (up to 30%) has prompted single\nstar formation scenarios to be proposed. If such formation scenarios without\ninteraction were possible, that would also imply the existence of hot subdwarfs\nin wide binaries that have undergone no interaction. We probe the existence of\nthese systems by analysing light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey\nSatellite (TESS) for all known hot subdwarfs with a main sequence wide binary\ncompanion, and by searching for common proper motion pairs to spectroscopically\nconfirmed hot subdwarfs. We find that (i) the companions in composite hot\nsubdwarfs show short rotation periods when compared to field main sequence\nstars. They display a triangular-shaped distribution with a peak around 2.5\ndays, similar to what is observed for young open clusters. This observed\ndistribution of rotation rates for the companions in known wide hot subdwarf\nbinaries provides evidence of previous interaction causing spin-up. We also\nreport (ii) a shortage of hot subdwarfs with candidate common proper motion\ncompanions, considering the frequency of such systems among progenitors. We\nidentify only 16 candidates after probing 2938 hot subdwarfs with good\nastrometry.

Furthermore, for any $c(N)$\nsatisfying $$\\frac{Nc(N)}{M(N)\\ln(N)}\\to \\infty\\quad \\text{and}\\quad c(N)\\to\n\\infty,$$ as $N\\to\\infty$, we show that proportionally sparse random\ncompatibility graphs can be designed, so that the degree of each server is at\nmost $c(N)$. This reduces the server-degree almost by a factor $N/\\ln(N)$,\ncompared to the complete bipartite compatibility graph, while maintaining the\nsame asymptotic performance. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to\ncorroborate the theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 18:24:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 17:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

Here, we follow a heuristic\napproach by examining the fate of helium stars in the mass range 4 to 12Msun,\nwhich presumably form in interacting binaries. The helium stars are evolved\nusing stellar wind mass loss rates that agree with observations, and which\nreproduce the observed luminosity range of galactic WR stars, leading to\nstellar masses at core collapse in the range 3-5.5Msun. We then explode these\nmodels adopting an explosion energy proportional to the ejecta mass, roughly\nconsistent with theoretical predictions. We impose a fixed 56Ni mass and strong\nmixing. The SN radiation from 3 to 100d is computed self-consistently starting\nfrom the input stellar models using the time-dependent non-local thermodynamic\nequilibrium radiative-transfer code CMFGEN. By design, our fiducial models\nyield similar light curves, with a rise time of ~20d and a peak luminosity of\n~10^42.2erg/s, in line with representative SNe Ibc. The less massive\nprogenitors retain a He-rich envelope and reproduce the color, line widths, and\nline strengths of a representative sample of SNe Ib, while stellar winds remove\nmost of the helium in more massive progenitors, whose spectra match typical SNe\nIc in detail. The transition between the predicted Ib-like and Ic-like spectra\nis continuous, but it is sharp, such that the resulting models essentially form\na dichotomy. Further models computed with varying explosion energy, 56Ni mass,\nand long-term power injection from the remnant show that a moderate variation\nof these parameters can reproduce much of the diversity of SNe Ibc. We conclude\nthat stars stripped by a binary companion can account for the vast majority of\nordinary SNe Ib and Ic, and that stellar wind mass loss is the key to remove\nthe helium envelope in SN Ic progenitors.

The most commonly\npracticed setting for choir ensembles consists of four parts; Soprano, Alto,\nTenor and Bass (SATB), each with its own range of fundamental frequencies\n(F$0$s). The task of source separation for this choral setting entails\nseparating the SATB mixture into the constituent parts. Source separation for\nmusical mixtures is well studied and many deep learning based methodologies\nhave been proposed for the same. However, most of the research has been focused\non a typical case which consists in separating vocal, percussion and bass\nsources from a mixture, each of which has a distinct spectral structure. In\ncontrast, the simultaneous and harmonic nature of ensemble singing leads to\nhigh structural similarity and overlap between the spectral components of the\nsources in a choral mixture, making source separation for choirs a harder task\nthan the typical case. This, along with the lack of an appropriate consolidated\ndataset has led to a dearth of research in the field so far. In this paper we\nfirst assess how well some of the recently developed methodologies for musical\nsource separation perform for the case of SATB choirs. We then propose a novel\ndomain-specific adaptation for conditioning the recently proposed U-Net\narchitecture for musical source separation using the fundamental frequency\ncontour of each of the singing groups and demonstrate that our proposed\napproach surpasses results from domain-agnostic architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 22:07:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

However, they have some drawbacks that still need to\nbe addressed. Most importantly, the scalability of transmons is limited by the\nlarge device footprint needed to reduce the participation of the lossy\ncapacitive parts of the circuit. In this work, we investigate and evaluate\nlosses in an alternative device geometry, namely, the merged-element transmon\n(mergemon). To this end, we replace the large external shunt capacitor of a\ntraditional transmon with the intrinsic capacitance of a Josephson junction\n(JJ) and achieve an approximately 100 times reduction in qubit dimensions. We\nreport the implementation of the mergemon using a sputtered\nNb--amorphous-Si--Nb trilayer film. In an experiment below 10 mK, the frequency\nof the readout resonator, capacitively coupled to the mergemon, exhibits a\nqubit-state dependent shift in the low power regime. The device also\ndemonstrates the single- and multi-photon transitions that represent a weakly\nanharmonic system in the two-tone spectroscopy. The transition spectra are\nexplained well with master-equation simulations. A participation ratio analysis\nidentifies the dielectric loss of the a-Si tunnel barrier and its interfaces as\nthe dominant source for qubit relaxation. We expect the mergemon to achieve\nhigh coherence in relatively small device dimensions when implemented using a\nlow-loss, epitaxially-grown, and lattice-matched trilayer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 22:26:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 16:51:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 14:55:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 22:19:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 19:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

The synthesis of HAC is inspired\nby the complementary benefits of the dc-based matching and ac-based\ngrid-forming controls as well as ideas from direct angle control and nonlinear\ndamping assignment.

We\ndevelop a stable and accurate hybrid eikonal solver for 2D and 3D transversely\nisotropic media with a tilted symmetry axis (TTI, or tilted transversely\nisotropic media). Our new eikonal solver combines the traveltime field\nfactorization technique, the third-order Lax-Friedrichs update scheme, and a\nnew method for computing the base traveltime field. The solver has the\nfollowing three advantages. First, there is no need to assign exact traveltime\nvalues in the near-source region, and the computed traveltime field near the\nsource location is accurate even for TTI media with strong anisotropy. Second,\nthe computed traveltime field is high-order accurate in space.

Previous works\nusually generate multiple tracks separately and the music notes from different\ntracks not explicitly depend on each other, which hurts the harmony modeling.\nTo improve harmony, in this paper, we propose a novel MUlti-track MIDI\nrepresentation (MuMIDI), which enables simultaneous multi-track generation in a\nsingle sequence and explicitly models the dependency of the notes from\ndifferent tracks. While this greatly improves harmony, unfortunately, it\nenlarges the sequence length and brings the new challenge of long-term music\nmodeling.

To determine whether a person has touched an object or\nsurface using visual data, images, or videos, is a hard problem. Computer\nvision 3D reconstruction approaches project objects and the human body from the\n2D image domain to 3D and perform 3D space intersection directly. However, this\nsolution would not meet the accuracy requirement in applications due to\nprojection error. Another standard approach is to train a neural network to\ninfer touch actions from the collected visual data. This strategy would require\nsignificant amounts of training data to generalize over scale and viewpoint\nvariations. A different approach to this problem is to identify whether a\nperson has touched a defined object. In this work, we show that the solution to\nthis problem can be straightforward. Specifically, we show that the contact\nbetween an object and a static surface can be identified by projecting the\nobject onto the static surface through two different viewpoints and analyzing\ntheir 2D intersection. The object contacts the surface when the projected\npoints are close to each other; we call this cross view projection consistency.\nInstead of doing 3D scene reconstruction or transfer learning from deep\nnetworks, a mapping from the surface in the two camera views to the surface\nspace is the only requirement. For planar space, this mapping is the Homography\ntransformation. This simple method can be easily adapted to real-life\napplications. In this paper, we apply our method to do office occupancy\ndetection for studying the COVID-19 transmission pattern from an office desk in\na meeting room using the contact information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 02:57:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

While various forms of models are\nproposed for the link prediction task, most of them are designed based on a few\nknown relation patterns in several well-known datasets. Due to the diversity\nand complexity nature of the real-world KGs, it is inherently difficult to\ndesign a model that fits all datasets well. To address this issue, previous\nwork has tried to use Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to search for the\nbest model for a given dataset. However, their search space is limited only to\nbilinear model families. In this paper, we propose a novel Neural Architecture\nSearch (NAS) framework for the link prediction task. First, the embeddings of\nthe input triplet are refined by the Representation Search Module. Then, the\nprediction score is searched within the Score Function Search Module. This\nframework entails a more general search space, which enables us to take\nadvantage of several mainstream model families, and thus it can potentially\nachieve better performance. We relax the search space to be continuous so that\nthe architecture can be optimized efficiently using gradient-based search\nstrategies.

In contrast, the post-classification pipeline aggregates the\nsnippet-level features first and then predicts the video-level classification\nscore based on the aggregated feature. Although the classifiers in these two\npipelines are used in different ways, the role they play is exactly the\nsame---to classify the given features to identify the corresponding action\ncategories.

In zonal mean,\nthese two terms oppose each other and peak during the Indian summer monsoon.\nThis zonal mean character arises from a rich longitudinal structure that is\nrevealed by splitting the globe into three zones, namely, the Asia-West Pacific\n(AWP), central Pacific-West Atlantic (CP-WA) and African sectors. The mean\nconvergence term is cohesive across all three regions, has a single peak in the\nboreal summer and always acts to decelerate the zonal flow. A Helmholtz\ndecomposition shows that the advection of absolute vorticity by the divergent\nmeridional wind in localized cross-equatorial cells is responsible for the\ncoherent nature of the mean convergence across all sectors.\n  On the other hand, the eddy convergence goes from being small and seasonally\ninvariant in the African region to one with large seasonal maxima (minima) in\nAWP (CP-WA) sector that accelerate (decelerate) the zonal mean flow. The\ndisparate nature the eddy flux in the AWP and CP-WA regions is in the winter\nseason and is due to the tropical and extratropical origin of waves,\nrespectively. In summer, the AWP region accounts for almost all of the eddy\nflux convergence. In fact, the leading role of the rotational zonal - divergent\nmeridional component in the zonal mean eddy flux does not hold in individual\nsectors. Finally, through the year, the CP-WA region is where the local\noverturning cell is strongly influenced by eddy activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 06:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

Here, using the\ntools of resource theory of superposition, we give the conditions for a class\nof superposition state transformations. These conditions strictly depend on the\nscalar products of the basis states and reduce to the well-known majorization\ncondition for quantum coherence in the limit of orthonormal basis. To further\nsuperposition-free transformations of $d$-dimensional systems, we provide\nsuperposition-free operators for a deterministic transformation of\nsuperposition states. The linear independence of a finite number of basis\nstates requires a relation between the scalar products of these states.

Due to\nthe latter process, the energy of the charge carriers in excess of the band gap\nis lost as heat and does not contribute to the conversion of solar to\nelectrical power. If the excess energy is more than the band gap it can in\nprinciple be utilized through a process known as carrier multiplication (CM) in\nwhich a single absorbed photon generates two (or more) pairs of electrons and\nholes. Thus, through CM the photon energy above twice the band gap enhances the\nphotocurrent of a solar cell.

We find that such a peculiar behavior can be attributed to the unique\nflat band physics on the Kagome lattice, which makes the mapping between the\nmean field ansatz and the RVB state non-injective. We find that the spin\nfluctuation spectrum of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ KAFH is not at all featureless,\nbut is characterized by a prominent spectral peak at about $0.25J$ around the\n$\\mathbf{M}$ point, which is immersed in a broad continuum extending to $2.7J$.\nBased on these results, we argue that the spectral peak below 2 meV in the\ninelastic neutron scattering(INS) spectrum of Hebertsmithite\nZnCu$_{3}$(OH)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$, which has been attributed to the contribution of\nCu$^{2+}$ impurity spins occupying the Zn$^{2+}$ site, should rather be\nunderstood as the intrinsic contribution from the Kagome layer.

In\nthis work, we propose a novel distance metric that is robust against\narbitrarily \"bad\" contamination and has a worst-case computational complexity\nof $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)$. We formally argue why our proposed metric is robust,\nand demonstrate in an empirical evaluation that the metric yields competitive\nclassification accuracy when applied in k-Nearest Neighbor time series\nclassification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 11:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

Since it overemphasizes the final performance, the\nassociation or fusion between context data and sequence data has not been well\ncaptured and utilized for sequential recommendation.

Estimators are\ncompared with descriptive statistics, graphical displays and with a random\neffects meta-analysis.

Ten sponsor\norganisations provided 17 trials including 186 types of AEs. The one minus KME\nwas on average about 1.2-fold larger than the AJE. Leading forces influencing\nbias were the amount of censoring and of CEs. As a consequence, the average\nbias using the incidence proportion was less than 5%. Assuming constant hazards\nusing incidence densities was hardly an issue provided that CEs were accounted\nfor. There is a need to improve the guidelines of reporting risks of AEs so\nthat the KME and the incidence proportion are replaced by the AJE with an\nappropriate definition of CEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 12:17:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

The goal of the\nproject is to reduce the uncertainties of observational estimates of mass-loss\nrates from Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. Line emission from 12CO J=2-1\nand 3-2 were mapped using the ACA. In this initial analysis, the emission\ndistribution was fit to a Gaussian distribution in the uv-plane. Detailed\nradiative transfer analysis will be presented in the future. The axes of the\nbest-fit Gaussian at the line center of the 12CO J=2-1 emission gives a first\nindication of the size of the emitting region. Furthermore, the fitting\nresults, such as the major and minor axis, center position, and the goodness of\nfit across both lines, constrain the symmetry of the emission distribution. We\nfind that the CO envelope sizes are, in general, larger for C-type than for\nM-type AGB stars, which is expected if the CO/H2 ratio is larger in C-type\nstars. Furthermore, a relation between the 12CO J=2-1 size and circumstellar\ndensity is shown that, while in broad agreement with photodissociation\ncalculations, reveals large scatter and systematic differences between the\nstellar types. The majority of the sources have CO envelopes that are\nconsistent with a spherically symmetric, smooth outflow. For about a third of\nthe sources, indications of strong asymmetries are found. This is consistent\nwith previous interferometric investigations of northern sources. Smaller scale\nasymmetries are found in a larger fraction of sources. These results for CO\nenvelope radii and shapes can be used to constrain detailed radiative transfer\nmodeling of the same stars so as to determine mass-loss rates that are\nindependent of photodissociation models. For a large fraction of the sources,\nobservations at higher spatial resolution will be necessary to further\ninvestigate the complex circumstellar dynamics revealed by our ACA\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 12:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

But, it requires more than one cardiovascular signals\ninvolving more than one sensing device. In this paper, we propose a method for\ncontinuous cuffless blood pressure measurement with the help of left\nventricular ejection time (LVET). The LVET is estimated using a signal obtained\nthrough a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)-based accelerometric sensor.\nThe sensor acquires a seismocardiogram (SCG) signal at the chest surface, and\nthe LVET information is extracted. Both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and\ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) are estimated by calibrating the system with the\noriginal arterial blood pressure values of the subjects. The proposed method is\nevaluated using different quantitative measures on the signals collected from\nten subjects under the supine position. The performance of the proposed method\nis also compared with two earlier approaches, where PTT intervals are estimated\nfrom electrocardiogram (ECG)-photoplethysmogram (PPG) and SCG-PPG,\nrespectively. The performance results clearly show that the proposed method is\ncomparable with the state-of-the-art methods. Also, the computed blood pressure\nis compared with the original one, measured through a CNAP system. It gives the\nmean errors of the estimated systolic BP and diastolic BP within the range of\n-0.19 +/- 3.3 mmHg and -1.29 +/- 2.6 mmHg, respectively. The mean absolute\nerrors for systolic BP and diastolic BP are 3.2 mmHg and 2.6 mmHg,\nrespectively. The accuracy of BPs estimated from the proposed method satisfies\nthe requirements of the IEEE standard of 5 +/- 8 mmHg deviation, and thus, it\nmay be used for ubiquitous long term blood pressure monitoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 12:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

Smart and automated\nelectric distribution systems are able to reconfigure as a response to changes\nin load levels to minimize active power losses.

Symmetry Based Disentangled Representation learning\nintroduced a robust mathematical framework that defined precisely what is meant\nby a \"linear disentangled representation\". This framework determined that such\nrepresentations would depend on a particular decomposition of the symmetry\ngroup acting on the data, showing that actions would manifest through\nirreducible group representations acting on independent representational\nsubspaces. Caselles-Dupre et al [2019] subsequently proposed the first model to\ninduce and demonstrate a linear disentangled representation in a VAE model. In\nthis work we empirically show that linear disentangled representations are not\ngenerally present in standard VAE models and that they instead require altering\nthe loss landscape to induce them. We proceed to show that such representations\nare a desirable property with regard to classical disentanglement metrics.\nFinally we propose a method to induce irreducible representations which forgoes\nthe need for labelled action sequences, as was required by prior work. We\nexplore a number of properties of this method, including the ability to learn\nfrom action sequences without knowledge of intermediate states and robustness\nunder visual noise. We also demonstrate that it can successfully learn 4\nindependent symmetries directly from pixels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 13:23:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 14:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-12"}

Specifically, one of\nthe intelligent agents - Q-BOT - is given two static frames from the beginning\nand the end of the video, as well as a finite number of opportunities to ask\nrelevant natural language questions before describing the unseen video. A-BOT,\nthe other agent who has already seen the entire video, assists Q-BOT to\naccomplish the goal by providing answers to those questions.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-BOT can\neffectively learn to describe an unseen video by the proposed model and the\ncooperative learning method, achieving the promising performance where Q-BOT is\ngiven the full ground truth history dialog.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 14:01:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 12:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

However, existing autoencoder recommenders use\nfully-connected neural network layers and do not employ structure learning.\nThis can lead to inefficient training, especially when the data is sparse as\ncommonly found in collaborative filtering. The aforementioned results in lower\ngeneralization ability and reduced performance. In this paper, we introduce\nstructure learning for autoencoder recommenders by taking advantage of the\ninherent item groups present in the collaborative filtering domain. Due to the\nnature of items in general, we know that certain items are more related to each\nother than to other items. Based on this, we propose a method that first learns\ngroups of related items and then uses this information to determine the\nconnectivity structure of an auto-encoding neural network. This results in a\nnetwork that is sparsely connected. This sparse structure can be viewed as a\nprior that guides the network training. Empirically we demonstrate that the\nproposed structure learning enables the autoencoder to converge to a local\noptimum with a much smaller spectral norm and generalization error bound than\nthe fully-connected network. The resultant sparse network considerably\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods like \\textsc{Mult-vae/Mult-dae} on\nmultiple benchmarked datasets even when the same number of parameters and flops\nare used.

However,\nsuch transferable capability may be impacted by the dataset bias, and this\nproblem has rarely been investigated before. Besides, most of few-shot learning\nmethods are biased to different datasets, which is also an important issue that\nneeds to be investigated deeply.

However, together with many advantages,\nbiometric systems are still vulnerable to presentation attacks (PAs). In\nparticular, this applies for unsupervised applications, where new attacks\nunknown to the system operator may occur. Therefore, presentation attack\ndetection (PAD) methods are used to determine whether samples stem from a bona\nfide subject or from a presentation attack instrument (PAI). In this context,\nmost works are dedicated to solve PAD as a two-class classification problem,\nwhich includes training a model on both bona fide and PA samples. In spite of\nthe good detection rates reported, these methods still face difficulties\ndetecting PAIs from unknown materials. To address this issue, we propose a new\nPAD technique based on autoencoders (AEs) trained only on bona fide samples\n(i.e. one-class), which are captured in the short wave infrared domain. On the\nexperimental evaluation over a database of 19,711 bona fide and 4,339 PA images\nincluding 45 different PAI species, a detection equal error rate (D-EER) of\n2.00% was achieved.

In this work, we formally establish that two recurring\ncharacteristics of real-world graphs, namely heavy-tailed degree distributions\nand large clustering coefficients, imply the existence of substantially large\nvertex neighborhoods with high edge-density. This observation suggests a very\nsimple approach for extracting large quasi-cliques: simply scan the vertex\nneighborhoods, compute the clustering coefficient of each vertex, and output\nthe best such subgraph. The implementation of such a method requires counting\nthe triangles in a graph, which is a well-studied problem in graph mining. When\nempirically tested across a number of real-world graphs, this approach reveals\na surprise: vertex neighborhoods include maximal cliques of non-trivial sizes,\nand the density of the best neighborhood often compares favorably to subgraphs\nproduced by dedicated algorithms for maximizing subgraph density. For graphs\nwith small clustering coefficients, we demonstrate that small vertex\nneighborhoods can be refined using a local-search method to ``grow'' larger\ncliques and near-cliques.

This result is consistent\nwith the inverse relation between the shadow radius and the real part of QNMs.\nIn addition, we have studied observational constraints on the EYM parameter\n$\\lambda$ via frequency analysis of QPOs and the EHT data of shadow cast by the\nM87 central black hole. We also find that the decaying rate of the EYM BH is\nslower than that of the neutral and ends up with a tail. We argue that the\nrotating EYM black hole can be distinguished from the Kerr-Newman black hole\nwith a magnetic charge based on the difference between the angular diameters of\ntheir shadows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 09:32:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-08"}

Even though such numerical errors are expected to be\nsmall, it is shown that in LES of buoyant convection the turbulent large-scale\nflow organization can modulate and amplify the error. Galilean invariance of\nglobal flow statistics is observed in well-resolved direct numerical\nsimulations (DNS). In LES of single-phase convection under an inversion, flow\nstatistics are nearly Galilean invariant and do not depend on the order of\naccuracy of the finite difference approximation. In contrast, in LES of cloudy\nconvection, flow statistics show strong dependence on the frame of reference\nand the order of approximation. The error with respect to the frame of\nreference becomes negligible as the order of accuracy is increased from second\nto sixth in the present LES. Schemes with low resolving power can produce large\ndispersion errors in the surface-fixed frame that can be amplified by\nlarge-scale flow anisotropies, such as strong updrafts rising in a\nnon-turbulent free troposphere in cumulus-cloud layers.

When mammograms are analyzed\nthrough a computational method, the presence of the pectoral muscle might\naffect the results of breast lesions detection. This problem is particularly\nevident in the mediolateral oblique view (MLO), where pectoral muscle occupies\na large part of the mammography. Therefore, identifying and eliminating the\npectoral muscle are essential steps for improving the automatic discrimination\nof breast tissue. In this paper, we propose an approach based on anatomical\nfeatures to tackle this problem. Our method consists of two steps: (1) a\nprocess to remove the noisy elements such as labels, markers, scratches and\nwedges, and (2) application of an intensity transformation based on the Beta\ndistribution. The novel methodology is tested with 322 digital mammograms from\nthe Mammographic Image Analysis Society (mini-MIAS) database and with a set of\n84 mammograms for which the area normalized error was previously calculated.\nThe results show a very good performance of the method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 20:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}
