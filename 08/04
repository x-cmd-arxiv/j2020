Based on fully resolved 3D\nsimulations, we describe the flow physics leading to breakup. Scaling\narguments, numerical simulation and experiments consistently show that for\nsmall initial offset, breakup always occurs with the droplet fragment volume\ndepending linearly on the offset. Above a critical offset, which increases with\nthe capillary number, the droplets enter the constriction sequentially without\nbreakup. Our results are relevant for understanding the breakup behavior in a\ndense emulsion flowing through a linearly converging channel leading to a\nconstriction. Such geometry is commonly used for the serial interrogation of\ndroplet content in droplet microfluidic applications, where droplet breakup can\nlimit the maximum throughput for such process. For capillary numbers up to\n$Ca\\simeq10^{-2}$, the results from the two-droplet system in a Y-junction are\nconsistent with breakup observations in dense emulsions flowing through a\nlinearly converging channel. The deterministic relation between initial offset\nand resulting breakup in the two-droplet system suggests that the stochasticity\nthat is observed in the breakup of a dense emulsion arises from multi-droplet\ninteractions. The numerical value of the prefactor in the linear relation\nbetween initial offset and droplet fragment volume determined from experiments\ndiffers slightly from the one extracted from fully resolved numerical\nsimulations. This discrepancy suggests that even at very high bulk surfactant\nconcentrations, the rate-limiting surfactant adsorption kinetics allows for\nMarangoni stresses to develop and modify the droplet dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 16:36:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

In doing so,\nwe also evaluate the degree to which linear response theory for solvent\npolarization is a reasonable approach for comparing the thermodynamics of bulk\nand interfacial ion solvation.

Many of\nthe stars and almost all of the most luminous have spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) with extended infrared excess radiation at the longest\nwavelengths.

At luminosities above 10^5 Solar luminosities there is a rapid\ntransition to higher mass loss rates that approximates and overlaps the de\nJager curve. We recommend that instead of using a linear relation or single\ncurve, the empirical mass loss rate -- luminosity relation is better\nrepresented by a broad band. Interestingly, the transition to much higher mass\nloss rates at about 10^5 Lsun corresponds approximately to an initial mass of\n18 --20 Msun which is close to the upper limit for RSGs becoming Type II SNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 18:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

We evaluate the\nperformance of computational and reconstruction accuracy for our proposed model\nwith extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Experimental results\nreveal that our proposed method uses fewer parameters and reduces the\ncomputational cost while maintaining reconstruction accuracy against\nstate-of-the-art SISR methods over well-known four SR benchmark datasets.

We separately consider the cases where gas circularizes\nrapidly into an accretion disc, as well as the case when shocked debris streams\nprovide the observable emission without having fully circularized. For the\nrapid circularization case, we describe how outflows, absorption by\nreprocessing layers, and Comptonization can cause the observed radiation to\ndepart from that of a bare disc, possibly giving rise to the observed\noptical/UV emission along with soft X-rays from the disc. If, instead, most of\nthe debris follows highly eccentric orbits for a significant time, many\nproperties of the observed optical/UV emission can be explained by the scale of\nthose eccentric orbits and the shocks embedded in the debris flow near orbital\napocenter. In this picture, soft X-ray emission at early times results from the\nsmaller amount of debris mass deflected into a compact accretion disc by weak\nshocks near the stellar pericenter. A general proposal for the near-constancy\nof the ultraviolet/optical color temperatures is provided, by linking it to\nincomplete thermalization of radiation in the atmosphere of the emitting\nregion. We also briefly discuss the radio signals from the interaction of\nunbound debris and jets with the black hole environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 18:16:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Characterising such complex behaviour under well\ncontrolled flows is key to understanding the microscopic mechanical properties\nof biological particles as well as the rheological properties of their\nsuspensions. While generating regions of simple shear flow in microfluidic\ndevices is relatively straightforward, generating straining flows in which the\nstrain rate is maintained constant for a sufficiently long time to observe the\nobjects' morphologic evolution is far from trivial. In this work, we propose an\ninnovative approach based on optimised design of microfluidic\nconverging-diverging channels coupled with a microscope-based tracking method\nto characterise the dynamic behaviour of individual bio-particles under\nhomogeneous straining flow. The tracking algorithm, combining a motorised stage\nand microscopy imaging system controlled by external signals, allows us to\nfollow individual bio-particles transported over long-distances with\nhigh-quality images.

This paper focuses on monocular pedestrian action recognition and 3D\nlocalization from an egocentric view for the purpose of predicting intention\nand forecasting future trajectory. A challenge in addressing this problem in\nurban traffic scenes is attributed to the unpredictable behavior of\npedestrians, whereby actions and intentions are constantly in flux and depend\non the pedestrians pose, their 3D spatial relations, and their interaction with\nother agents as well as with the environment. To partially address these\nchallenges, we consider the importance of pose toward recognition and 3D\nlocalization of pedestrian actions.

The problem is not only that they\nare difficult to identify and test, but also that it is believed that they may\nconstitute the bulk of the cases and could be crucial in the pandemic equation.\n  Methods: We present a novel algorithm to extract the number of these mild\ncases by correlating a COVID-line calls to reported cases in given districts.\nThe key assumption is to realize that, being a highly contagious disease, the\nnumber of calls by mild cases should be proportional to the number of reported\ncases. Whereas a background of calls not related to infected people should be\nproportional to the district population.\n  Results: We find that for Buenos Aires Province, in addition to the\nbackground, there are in signal 6.6 +/- 0.4 calls per each reported COVID-19\ncase. Using this we estimate in Buenos Aires Province 20 +/- 2 COVID-19\nsymptomatic cases for each one reported.\n  Conclusions: A very simple algorithm that models the COVID-line calls as sum\nof signal plus background allows to estimate the crucial number of the rate of\nsymptomatic to reported COVID-19 cases in a given district. The result from\nthis method is an early and inexpensive estimate and should be contrasted to\nother methods such as serology and/or massive testing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 20:17:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

However, it typically requires that demonstrations provide\nfull access to the state and action sequences. In contrast, learning from\nobservation offers a way to utilize unlabeled demonstrations (e.g., video) to\nperform imitation learning. One approach to this is behavioral cloning from\nobservation (BCO). The original implementation of BCO proceeds by first\nlearning an inverse dynamics model and then using that model to estimate action\nlabels, thereby reducing the problem to behavioral cloning. However, existing\napproaches to BCO require a large number of initial interactions in the first\nstep. Here, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of BCO, introduce a\nmodification BCO*, and show that in the semi-supervised setting, BCO* can\nconcurrently improve both its estimate for the inverse dynamics model and the\nexpert policy.

We show that\ncompared to other commonly used metrics, $m$-coherence is more interpretable,\ncheaper to compute ($O(m)$ instead of $O(m^2)$) and mathematically cleaner.

In this paper, we focus on an overloaded\nMultiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) Broadcast Channel (BC) with two groups of\nCSIT qualities, namely one group of users (representative of high-end devices)\nfor which the transmitter has partial knowledge of the CSI, the other group of\nusers (representative of IoT devices) for which the transmitter only has\nknowledge of the statistical CSI.

The\nmost fundamental elements are the concept of a macrostate in relation to the\nlarge-deviation entropy, and the decomposition of contributions to\nirreversibility among interacting subsystems, which is the origin of the\ndependence on a concept of heat in both classical and stochastic\nthermodynamics. A natural decomposition is shown to exist, into a relative\nentropy and a housekeeping entropy rate, which define respectively the\n\\textit{intensive} thermodynamics of a system and an \\textit{extensive}\nthermodynamic vector embedding the system in its context. Both intensive and\nextensive components are functions of Hartley information of the momentary\nsystem stationary state, which is information \\emph{about} the joint effect of\nsystem processes on its contribution to irreversibility.

For a given data set,\ntransient gravitational wave searches produce a corresponding list of triggers\nthat indicate the possible presence of a gravitational wave signal. These\ntriggers are often the result of glitches mimicking gravitational wave signal\ncharacteristics. To distinguish glitches from genuine gravitational wave\nsignals, search algorithms estimate a range of trigger attributes, with\nthresholds applied to these trigger properties to separate signal from noise.\nHere, we present the use of Gaussian mixture models, a supervised machine\nlearning approach, as a means of modelling the multi-dimensional trigger\nattribute space.

We are motivated in this pursuit by the fact that the physical world\nitself is mostly static, and multiview correspondence labels are relatively\ncheap to collect in static scenes, e.g., by triangulation. We propose to\nleverage multiview data of \\textit{static points} in arbitrary scenes (static\nor dynamic), to learn a neural 3D mapping module which produces features that\nare correspondable across time. The neural 3D mapper consumes RGB-D data as\ninput, and produces a 3D voxel grid of deep features as output. We train the\nvoxel features to be correspondable across viewpoints, using a contrastive\nloss, and correspondability across time emerges automatically. At test time,\ngiven an RGB-D video with approximate camera poses, and given the 3D box of an\nobject to track, we track the target object by generating a map of each\ntimestep and locating the object's features within each map. In contrast to\nmodels that represent video streams in 2D or 2.5D, our model's 3D scene\nrepresentation is disentangled from projection artifacts, is stable under\ncamera motion, and is robust to partial occlusions. We test the proposed\narchitectures in challenging simulated and real data, and show that our\nunsupervised 3D object trackers outperform prior unsupervised 2D and 2.5D\ntrackers, and approach the accuracy of supervised trackers. This work\ndemonstrates that 3D object trackers can emerge without tracking labels,\nthrough multiview self-supervision on static data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 02:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

By using archival images\nfrom the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we derive a set of parameters to describe\nthe dynamical state for 964 galaxy clusters. Three widely used indicators for\ndynamical state, the concentration index c, the centroid shift omega and the\npower ratio P3/P0 are calculated in the circular central region with a radius\nof 500 kpc. We also derive two adaptive parameters, the profile parameter kappa\nand the asymmetry factor alpha, in the best fitted elliptical region. The\nmorphology index delta is then defined by combining these two adaptive\nparameters, which indicates the dynamical state of galaxy clusters and has good\ncorrelations to the concentration index c, the centroid shift omega, the power\nratio P3/P0, and the optical relaxation factor Gamma. For a large sample of\nclusters, the dynamical parameters are continuously distributed from the\ndisturbed to relaxed states with a peak in the between, rather than the bimodal\ndistribution for the two states.

Here we\npresent how to overcome this problem by imposing a condition that everyone\nshould agree about the nature of the relativistic spin observable: it must be\nintrinsic. The intrinsicality concept is analyzed in the relativistic classical\nlimit and then it is extended to the quantum regime, the spin problem being\ntreated in the context of the irreducible unitary representations of the\nPoincar\\'{e} group. This approach rules out three-vector proposals of\nrelativistic spin observable and leads to a unique satisfactory spin definition\nthat, besides being intrinsic, also possesses interesting physical features\nsuch as covariance and consistency of predictions in the non relativistic\nlimit.

The existing eikonal methods for\ndiscrete-state processes including chemical reaction networks are based on the\nLiouville operator that evolves generating functions of the underlying\nprobability distribution.

Here, a\nhexagonal transverse coupled cavity VCSEL adiabatically coupled through the\ncenter cavity is proposed. A 3-dB roll-off modulation bandwidth of 45 GHz is\ndemonstrated, which is five times greater than a conventional VCSEL fabricated\non the same epi-wafer structure. While a parity time (PT) symmetry approaches\nadd loss to engineer the topological state of the laser system, here, a radical\nparadigm shift with gain introduces symmetry breaking. This idea, then enables\na single mode operation with a side-mode suppression-ratio (SMSR) of > 30\ndecibels and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of > 45 decibels. The energy\ndistribution inside the coupled cavity system is also redistributed to provide\na coherent gain in a spatially separated system.

To avoid this kind of\nsituation, this paper proposes an algorithm that deals with the localization\nproblem of the UAV in GNSS-denied environments.

The ratio of buildings that occupy in the\ncorresponding image frame is calculated and matched with the building\ninformation on the numerical map.

While the problem of POS tagging can essentially be considered\nas solved for modern languages, historical corpora turn out to be much more\ndifficult, especially due to the lack of native speakers and sparsity of\ntraining data. Moreover, most texts have no sentences as we know them today,\nnor a common orthography. These irregularities render the task of automated POS\ntagging more difficult and error-prone. Under these circumstances, instead of\nforcing the POS tagger to predict and commit to a single tag, it should be\nenabled to express its uncertainty. In this paper, we consider POS tagging\nwithin the framework of set-valued prediction, which allows the POS tagger to\nexpress its uncertainty via predicting a set of candidate POS tags instead of\nguessing a single one.

Since three perfect\nmatchings suffice only when the graph in question is $3$-edge-colourable, the\nrest of cubic graphs falls into two classes: those that can be covered with\nfour perfect matchings, and those that need at least five. Cubic graphs that\nrequire more than four perfect matchings to cover their edges are particularly\ninteresting as potential counterexamples to several profound and long-standing\nconjectures including the celebrated cycle double cover conjecture. However, so\nfar they have been extremely difficult to find.\n  In this paper we build a theory that describes coverings with four perfect\nmatch\\-ings as flows whose flow values and outflow patterns form a\nconfiguration of six lines spanned by four points of the 3-dimensional\nprojective space $\\mathbb{P}_3(\\mathbb{F}_2)$ in general position.

Recent works have shown that\nabstract interpretation can provide a unifying theory for various constraint\nsolvers.

We propose a modular\nframework in which solvers and cooperation schemes can be seamlessly added and\ncombined. This differs from existing approaches such as SMT where the\ncooperation scheme is usually fixed (e.g., Nelson-Oppen). We contribute to two\nnew cooperation schemes: (i) interval propagators completion that allows\nabstract domains to exchange bound constraints, and (ii) delayed product which\nexchanges over-approximations of constraints between two abstract domains.\nMoreover, the delayed product is based on delayed goal of logic programming,\nand it shows that abstract domains can also capture control aspects of\nconstraint solving. Finally, to achieve modularity, we propose the shared\nproduct to combine abstract domains and cooperation schemes.

Moreover, the channel-wise attention mechanism is adapted in\nthe 3D-FCN to grasp the most informative channels from redundant channel\ninformation. Finally, the CSPN is introduced to capture the spatial\ncorrelations of HSI via learning a local linear spatial propagation, which\nallows maintaining the HSI spatial consistency and further refining the\nclassification results.

The flare excited\nsmall-amplitude kink oscillation of a remote coronal loop. The oscillation\nlasted for $\\ge$4 cycles without significant damping. The amplitude and period\nare 0.3$\\pm$0.1 Mm and 207$\\pm$12 s. Interestingly, the flare also excited\ntransverse oscillation of a remote filament. The oscillation lasted for\n$\\sim$3.5 cycles with decaying amplitudes. The initial amplitude is 1.7$-$2.2\nMm. The period and damping time are 437$-$475 s and 1142$-$1600 s. The starting\ntimes of simultaneous oscillations of coronal loop and filament were concurrent\nwith the hard X-ray peak time. Though small in size and short in lifetime, the\nflare set off a chain reaction. It generated a bright secondary flare ribbon\n(SFR) in the chromosphere, remote brightening (RB) that was cospatial with the\nfilament, and intermittent, jet-like flow propagating in the northeast\ndirection. The loop oscillation is most probably excited by the flare-induced\nblast wave at a speed of $\\ge$1300 km s$^{-1}$. The excitation of the filament\noscillation is more complicated. The blast wave triggers secondary magnetic\nreconnection far from the main flare, which not only heats the local plasma to\nhigher temperatures (SFR and RB), but produces jet-like flow (i.e.,\nreconnection outflow) as well. The filament is disturbed by the secondary\nmagnetic reconnection and experiences transverse oscillation. The findings give\nnew insight into the excitation of transverse oscillations of coronal loops and\nfilaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 10:46:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

In this paper, we\nfocus on improving the efficiency of language pre-training methods through\nproviding better data utilization. It is well-known that in language data\ncorpus, words follow a heavy-tail distribution. A large proportion of words\nappear only very few times and the embeddings of rare words are usually poorly\noptimized. We argue that such embeddings carry inadequate semantic signals,\nwhich could make the data utilization inefficient and slow down the\npre-training of the entire model. To mitigate this problem, we propose Taking\nNotes on the Fly (TNF), which takes notes for rare words on the fly during\npre-training to help the model understand them when they occur next time.\nSpecifically, TNF maintains a note dictionary and saves a rare word's\ncontextual information in it as notes when the rare word occurs in a sentence.\nWhen the same rare word occurs again during training, the note information\nsaved beforehand can be employed to enhance the semantics of the current\nsentence. By doing so, TNF provides better data utilization since\ncross-sentence information is employed to cover the inadequate semantics caused\nby rare words in the sentences. We implement TNF on both BERT and ELECTRA to\ncheck its efficiency and effectiveness. Experimental results show that TNF's\ntraining time is $60\\%$ less than its backbone pre-training models when\nreaching the same performance. When trained with the same number of iterations,\nTNF outperforms its backbone methods on most of downstream tasks and the\naverage GLUE score.

However, existing hashing methods cannot\nachieve satisfactory retrieval performance for hash bucket search in complex\nscenarios, since they learn only one hash code for each image.

This work proposes a new\nformulation to achieve simultaneous maximum consensus and model estimation\n(MCME), which has two significant features compared with traditional MC robust\nfitting. First, it takes fitting residual into account in finding inliers,\nhence its lowest achievable residual in model fitting is lower than that of MC\nrobust fitting. Second, it has an unconstrained formulation involving binary\nvariables, which facilitates the use of the effective semidefinite relaxation\n(SDR) method to handle the underlying challenging combinatorial optimization\nproblem.

In the literature, phase distortion issues are generally circumvented by\nmeans of a background wave velocity model. However, it requires a prior\ntomography of the wave velocity distribution in the medium, which is often not\npossible, especially in depth. In this paper, a matrix approach of seismic\nimaging is developed to retrieve a three-dimensional image of the subsoil,\ndespite a rough knowledge of the background wave velocity. To do so, passive\nnoise cross-correlations between geophones of a seismic array are investigated\nunder a matrix formalism. More precisely, the detrimental effect of wave\nvelocity fluctuations on imaging is overcome by introducing a novel\nmathematical object: The distortion matrix. This operator essentially connects\nany virtual source inside the medium with the distortion that a wavefront,\nemitted from that point, experiences due to heterogeneities. A time reversal\nanalysis of the distortion matrix enables the estimation of the transmission\nmatrix that links each real geophone at the surface and each virtual geophone\nin depth. Phase distortions can then be compensated for any point of the\nunderground. Applied to seismic data recorded along the Clark branch of the San\nJacinto fault zone, the present method is shown to provide an image of the\nfault until a depth of 4 km with a transverse resolution of 80 m. Strikingly,\nthis resolution is almost one eighth below the diffraction limit imposed by the\ngeophone array aperture. The heterogeneities of the subsoil play the role of a\nscattering lens and of a transverse wave guide which increase drastically the\narray aperture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 14:45:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 10:50:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 10:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}

This enhancement -- resulting in a\nbreakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law with an anomalously large Lorenz ratio --\nhas been recently observed in two-dimensional monolayer and bilayer graphene\nnear the charge neutrality point. In contrast to this, three-dimensional\ncompensated semimetals such as WP$_2$ and Sb are typically found to show a\nreduced Lorenz ratio. This dramatic difference in behavior is generally\nattributed to different regimes of Fermi statistics in the two cases:\ndegenerate electron-hole liquid in compensated semimetals versus non-degenerate\nelectron-hole liquid in graphene. We show that this difference is not\nsufficient to explain the reduction of the Lorenz ratio in compensated\nsemimetals. We argue that the solution of the puzzle lies in the ability of\ncompensated semimetals to sustain sizeable regions of electron-hole\naccumulation near the contacts, which in turn is a consequence of the large\nseparation of electron and hole pockets in momentum space. These accumulations\nsuppress the ambipolar conduction mechanism and effectively split the system\ninto two independent electron and hole conductors. We present a quantitative\ntheory of the crossover from ambipolar to unipolar conduction as a function of\nthe size of the electron-hole accumulation regions, and show that it naturally\nleads to a sample-size-dependent thermal conductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 15:29:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

The benefits of this hybrid optimization are a high discriminative\npower and invariance to color and grayscale images.

It acts as a test\nbed for AI and motivator of research. The AI is given a random game description\nat runtime which it then plays. The framework includes repositories of game\nrules. The Inductive General Game Playing (IGGP) problem challenges machine\nlearning systems to learn these GGP game rules by watching the game being\nplayed. In other words, IGGP is the problem of inducing general game rules from\nspecific game observations. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) has shown to be a\npromising approach to this problem though it has been demonstrated that it is\nstill a hard problem for ILP systems. Existing work on IGGP has always assumed\nthat the game player being observed makes random moves. This is not\nrepresentative of how a human learns to play a game. With random gameplay\nsituations that would normally be encountered when humans play are not present.\nTo address this limitation, we analyse the effect of using intelligent versus\nrandom gameplay traces as well as the effect of varying the number of traces in\nthe training set. We use Sancho, the 2014 GGP competition winner, to generate\nintelligent game traces for a large number of games. We then use the ILP\nsystems, Metagol, Aleph and ILASP to induce game rules from the traces. We\ntrain and test the systems on combinations of intelligent and random data\nincluding a mixture of both. We also vary the volume of training data. Our\nresults show that whilst some games were learned more effectively in some of\nthe experiments than others no overall trend was statistically significant. The\nimplications of this work are that varying the quality of training data as\ndescribed in this paper has strong effects on the accuracy of the learned game\nrules; however one solution does not work for all games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 15:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

Moreover, time information of location visits is usually\ndropped, or its resolution is drastically reduced. In this paper we present a\nnovel technique for privately releasing a composite generative model and whole\nhigh-dimensional location datasets with detailed time information. To generate\nhigh-fidelity synthetic data, we leverage several peculiarities of vehicular\nmobility such as its language-like characteristics (\"you should know a location\nby the company it keeps\") or how humans plan their trips from one point to the\nother. We model the generator distribution of the dataset by first constructing\na variational autoencoder to generate the source and destination locations, and\nthe corresponding timing of trajectories. Next, we compute transition\nprobabilities between locations with a feed forward network, and build a\ntransition graph from the output of this model, which approximates the\ndistribution of all paths between the source and destination (at a given time).\nFinally, a path is sampled from this distribution with a Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo method. The generated synthetic dataset is highly realistic, scalable,\nprovides good utility and, nonetheless, provably private.

This paper\ninvestigates the network controllability robustness from the perspective of a\nmalicious attack. A framework of hierarchical attack is proposed, by means of\nedge- or node-removal attacks. Edges (or nodes) in a target network are\nclassified hierarchically into categories, with different priorities to attack.\nThe category of critical edges (or nodes) has the highest priority to be\nselected for attack. Extensive experiments on nine synthetic networks and nine\nreal-world networks show the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical attack\nstrategies for destructing the network controllability. From the protection\npoint of view, this study suggests that the critical edges and nodes should be\nhidden from the attackers.

To explore new energy sources, various\nstudies have been conducted to improve the drilling performance of drilling\nequipment for deep and strong ground. However, with better performance, the\nmodern drilling equipment is bulky and, furthermore, has become inconvenient in\nboth installation and operation, for it takes complex procedures for complex\nterrains. Moreover, environmental issues are also a concern because of the\nexcessive use of mud and slurry to remove excavated soil. To overcome these\nlimitations, a mechanism that combines an expandable drill bit and link\nstructure to simulate the function of the teeth and forelimbs of a mole is\nproposed. In this paper, the proposed expandable drill bit simplifies the\ncomplexity and high number of degrees of freedom of the animal head. In\naddition, a debris removal mechanism mimicking a shoulder structure and\nforefoot movement is proposed. For efficient debris removal, the proposed\nmechanism enables the simultaneous rotation and expanding/folding motions of\nthe drill bit by using a single actuator. The performance of the proposed\nsystem is evaluated by dynamic simulations and experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 08:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

It was Mendeleev who proposed a periodic table based on the extensive\nperiodic law and predicted a number of unknown elements at that time. The\nperiodic table currently used worldwide is of a long form pioneered by Werner\nin 1905. As the first topic, we describe the work of Pfeiffer (1920), who\nrefined Werner's work and rearranged the rare-earth elements in a separate\ntable below the main table for convenience. Today's widely used periodic table\nessentially inherits Pfeiffer's arrangements. Although long-form tables more\nprecisely represent electron orbitals around a nucleus, they lose some of the\nfeatures of Mendeleev's short-form table to express similarities of chemical\nproperties of elements when forming compounds. As the second topic, we compare\nvarious three-dimensional helical periodic tables that resolve some of the\nshortcomings of the long-form periodic tables in this respect. In particular,\nwe explain how the 3D periodic table \"Elementouch\" (Maeno 2001), which combines\nthe s- and p-blocks into one tube, can recover features of Mendeleev's periodic\nlaw. Finally we introduce a topic on the recently proposed nuclear periodic\ntable based on the proton magic numbers (Hagino and Maeno 2020). Here, the\nnuclear shell structure leads to a new arrangement of the elements with the\nproton magic-number nuclei treated like noble-gas atoms. We show that the\nresulting alignments of the elements in both the atomic and nuclear periodic\ntables are common over about two thirds of the tables because of a fortuitous\ncoincidence in their magic numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 07:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}
