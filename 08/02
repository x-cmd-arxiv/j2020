Experimental research in\nhow those reactions precisely contribute to detachment is limited. In this\nwork, we investigate a new spectroscopic technique to utilise Hydrogen Balmer\nline measurements to 1) disentangle the Balmer line emission from the various\nplasma-atom and plasma-molecule interactions; and 2) quantify their\ncontributions to ionisation, recombination and radiative power losses. During\ndetachment, the observed $H\\alpha$ emission often strongly increases, which\ncould be an indicator for plasma-molecule interactions involving $H_2^+$ and/or\n$H^-$. Our analysis technique quantifies the $H\\alpha$ emission due to\nplasma-molecule interactions and uses this to 1) quantify the Balmer line\nemission contribution due to $H_2^+$ and/or $H^-$; 2) subsequently estimate its\nresulting particle sinks/sources and radiative power losses. Its performance is\nverified using synthetic diagnostic techniques of both detached TCV and MAST-U\nSOLPS-ITER simulations. Experimental results of this technique on TCV data show\na bifurcation occurs between the measured total $H\\alpha$ and the atomic\nestimate of $H\\alpha$ emission, indicative of the presence of additional\n$H\\alpha$ due to plasma-molecule interactions with $H_2^+$ (and/or $H^-$).

This also constitutes the first\nfracture mechanics analysis of gradient plasticity theories adopting Nye's\ntensor as primal kinematic variable. First, the asymptotic nature of crack tip\nfields is analytically investigated. We show that an inner elastic region\nexists, adjacent to the crack tip, where elastic strains dominate plastic\nstrains and Cauchy stresses follow the linear elastic stress singularity. This\nfinding is verified by detailed finite element analyses using a new numerical\nframework, which builds upon a viscoplastic constitutive law that enables\ncapturing both rate-dependent and rate-independent behaviour in a\ncomputationally efficient manner. Numerical analysis is used to gain further\ninsight into the stress elevation predicted by distortion gradient plasticity,\nrelative to conventional J2 plasticity, and the influence of the plastic spin\nunder both mode I and mixed-mode fracture conditions. It is found that Nye's\ntensor contributions have a weaker effect in elevating the stresses in the\nplastic region, while predicting the same asymptotic behaviour as constitutive\nchoices based on the plastic strain gradient tensor. A minor sensitivity to X,\nthe parameter governing the dissipation due to the plastic spin, is observed.\nFinally, distortion gradient plasticity and suitable higher order boundary\nconditions are used to appropriately model the phenomenon of brittle failure\nalong elastic-plastic material interfaces. We reproduce paradigmatic\nexperiments on niobium-sapphire interfaces and show that the combination of\nstrain gradient hardening and dislocation blockage leads to interface crack tip\nstresses that are larger than the theoretical lattice strength, rationalising\ncleavage in the presence of plasticity at bi-material interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2020 16:14:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2020 06:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

Methods: Filaments\naround ~35000 HiGAL clumps that are detected using the DisPerSE algorithm. Hub\nis defined as a junction of three or more filaments. Column density maps were\nmasked by the filament skeletons and averaged for HFS and non-HFS samples to\ncompute the radial profile along the filaments into the clumps. Results:\n~3700~(11\\%) are candidate HFS of which, ~2150~(60\\%) are pre-stellar,\n~1400~(40\\%) are proto-stellar.

Though a large part of the literature on pattern formation\naddresses uniformly forced systems, nonuniform forcings are also observed in\nseveral natural systems, for instance, in developmental biology and in soft\nmatter applications. In these cases, an orientation effect due to forcing\ngradients is a new factor playing a role in the development of patterns,\nparticularly in the class of stripe patterns, which we investigate through the\nnonuniformly forced SH dynamics. The present work addresses amplitude\ninstability of stripe textures induced by forcing gradients, and the\ncompetition between the orientation effect of the gradient and other bulk,\nboundary, and geometric effects taking part in the selection of the emerging\npatterns. A weakly nonlinear analysis suggests that stripes are stable with\nrespect to small amplitude perturbations when aligned with the gradient, and\nbecome unstable to such perturbations when when aligned perpendicularly to the\ngradient. This analysis is vastly complemented by a numerical work that\naccounts for other effects, confirming that forcing gradients drive stripe\nalignment, or even reorient them from preexisting conditions. However, we\nobserve that the orientation effect does not always prevail in the face of\ncompeting effects, whose hierarchy is suggested to depend on the magnitude of\nthe forcing gradient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2020 19:07:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 05:28:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 28 Aug 2021 23:30:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

The need for reliable grasping imposes stringent\naccuracy requirements on pose estimation in cluttered, occluded scenes in\ndynamic environments. Modern methods employ large sets of training data to\nlearn features in order to find correspondence between 3D models and observed\ndata. However these methods require extensive annotation of ground truth poses.\nAn alternative is to use algorithms that search for the best explanation of the\nobserved scene in a space of possible rendered scenes. A recently developed\nalgorithm, PERCH (PErception Via SeaRCH) does so by using depth data to\nconverge to a globally optimum solution using a search over a specially\nconstructed tree. While PERCH offers strong guarantees on accuracy, the current\nformulation suffers from low scalability owing to its high runtime. In\naddition, the sole reliance on depth data for pose estimation restricts the\nalgorithm to scenes where no two objects have the same shape. In this work, we\npropose PERCH 2.0, a novel perception via search strategy that takes advantage\nof GPU acceleration and RGB data. We show that our approach can achieve a\nspeedup of 100x over PERCH, as well as better accuracy than the\nstate-of-the-art data-driven approaches on 6-DoF pose estimation without the\nneed for annotating ground truth poses in the training data.

The correct\nphoton-to-jet assignment efficiency improves by a factor of 3 with a\n$3\\%/\\sqrt{E}$ EM resolution. In addition, the technique of bremsstrahlung\nphoton recovery significantly improves electron momentum measurements. A high\nEM resolution calorimeter increases the Z boson recoil mass resolution in\nHiggstrahlung events for decays into electron pairs to 80% of that for muon\npairs. We present the design and optimization of a highly segmented crystal\ndetector concept that achieves the required energy resolution, and a time\nresolution better than 30 ps providing exceptional particle identification\ncapabilities. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous detector designs that\nsuffered from large neutral hadron resolution degradation from one interaction\nlength of crystals in front of a sampling hadron calorimeter, the\nimplementation of dual-readout on crystals permits to achieve a resolution\nbetter than $30\\%/\\sqrt{E}\\oplus 2\\%$ for neutral hadrons.

Sensitivity maps identify regions where small-amplitude\ncontrol is the most effective, i.e. yields the largest first-order (linear)\neigenvalue variation. In this study an adjoint method is proposed for computing\na second-order (quadratic) sensitivity operator, and applied to the flow past a\ncircular cylinder, controlled with a steady body force or a passive device\nmodel. Maps of second-order eigenvalue variations are obtained, without\ncomputing controlled base flows and eigenmodes. For finite control amplitudes,\nthe second-order analysis improves the accuracy of the first-order prediction,\nand informs about its range of validity, and whether it underestimates or\noverestimates the actual eigenvalue variation. Regions are identified where\ncontrol has little or no first-order effect but a second-order effect. In the\ncylinder wake, the effect of a control cylinder tends to be underestimated by\nthe first-order sensitivity, and including second-order effects yields larger\nregions of flow restabilisation. Second-order effects can be decomposed into\ntwo mechanisms: second-order base flow modification, and interaction between\nfirst-order modifications of the base flow and eigenmode. Both contribute\nequally in general in sensitive regions of the cylinder wake.

By contrast, electrical and thermal transport properties of\nHEAs/MEAs are less well studied. Here we investigate these two properties of\nsilicon (Si)-germanium (Ge)-tin (Sn) MEAs, where we keep the same content of Si\nand Ge while increasing the content of Sn from 0 to 1/3 to tune the\nconfigurational entropy and thus the degree of compositional disorder. We\npredict all SiyGeySnx MEAs to be semiconductors with a wide range of bandgaps\nfrom near-infrared (0.28 eV) to visible (1.11 eV) in the light spectrum. We\nfind that the bandgaps and effective carrier masses decrease with increasing Sn\ncontent. As a result, increasing the compositional disorder in SiyGeySnx MEAs\nenhances their electrical conductivity. For the thermal transport properties of\nSiyGeySnx MEAs, our molecular dynamics simulations show an opposite trend in\nthe thermal conductivity of these MEAs at room temperature, which decreases\nwith increasing compositional disorder, owing to enhanced Anderson localization\nand strong phonon-phonon anharmonic interactions. The enhanced electrical\nconductivity and weakened thermal conductivity make SiyGeySnx MEAs with high Sn\ncontent promising functional materials for thermoelectric applications.

This platform permits to engineer optical traps at the beam axis\nwith a response governed by nonconservative and giant recoil forces coming from\nthe directional excitation of ultra-confined surface plasmons during the light\nscattering process. Compared to optical traps set over bulk metals, the\nproposed traps are broadband in the sense that can be set with beams\noscillating at any frequency within the wide range in which the metasurface\nsupports surface plasmons. Over that range, the metasurface evolves from an\nanisotropic elliptic to a hyperbolic regime through a topological transition\nand enables optical traps with distinctive spatially asymmetric potential\ndistribution, local potential barriers arising from the momentum imbalance of\nthe excited plasmons, and an enhanced potential depth that permits the stable\ntrapping of nanoparticles using low-intensity laser beams. To investigate the\nperformance of this platform, we develop a rigorous formalism based on the\nLorentz force within the Rayleigh approximation combined with anisotropic\nGreen's functions and calculate the trapping potential of nonconservative\nforces using the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition method. Tailored anisotropic and\nhyperbolic metasurfaces, commonly implemented by nanostructuring thin metallic\nlayers, enables using low-intensity laser sources operating in the visible or\nthe IR to trap and manipulate particles at the nanoscale, and may enable a wide\nrange of applications in bioengineering, physics, and chemistry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2020 22:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

Motivated by the idea that HD images can be\ngenerated by adding high-frequency residuals to low-resolution results produced\nby a neural network, we propose a novel framework known as Animating Through\nWarping (ATW) to enable efficient animation of HD images.\n  Specifically, the proposed framework consists of two modules, a novel\ntwo-stage neural-network generator and a novel post-processing module known as\nAnimating Through Warping (ATW). It only requires the generator to be trained\non small images and can do inference on an image of any size. During inference,\nan HD input image is decomposed into a low-resolution component(128x128) and\nits corresponding high-frequency residuals. The generator predicts the\nlow-resolution result as well as the motion field that warps the input face to\nthe desired status (e.g., expressions categories or action units). Finally, the\nResWarp module warps the residuals based on the motion field and adding the\nwarped residuals to generates the final HD results from the naively up-sampled\nlow-resolution results. Experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of\nour method in generating high-resolution animations.

This work addresses this\nchallenge, accounting for changes in complex three-dimensional environments\nwith the creation of a probabilistic filter that operates on the features that\ngive rise to landmarks. To accomplish this, landmarks are clustered into\ncliques and a filter is developed to estimate their persistence jointly among\nobservations of the landmarks in a clique.

Ensemble\nforecasting has been used in numerical weather prediction for many years as a\nway to combine different predictions in order to obtain a more accurate result.\nHere we construct ensemble forecasts for major solar flares by linearly\ncombining the full-disk probabilistic forecasts from a group of operational\nforecasting methods (ASAP, ASSA, MAG4, MOSWOC, NOAA, and MCSTAT).

As training deep models usually consumes massive data and\ncomputational resources, trading the trained deep models is highly demanded and\nlucrative nowadays. Unfortunately, the naive trading schemes typically involves\npotential risks related to copyright and trustworthiness issues, e.g., a sold\nmodel can be illegally resold to others without further authorization to reap\nhuge profits. To tackle this problem, various watermarking techniques are\nproposed to protect the model intellectual property, amongst which the\nbackdoor-based watermarking is the most commonly-used one. However, the\nrobustness of these watermarking approaches is not well evaluated under\nrealistic settings, such as limited in-distribution data availability and\nagnostic of watermarking patterns. In this paper, we benchmark the robustness\nof watermarking, and propose a novel backdoor-based watermark removal framework\nusing limited data, dubbed WILD. The proposed WILD removes the watermarks of\ndeep models with only a small portion of training data, and the output model\ncan perform the same as models trained from scratch without watermarks\ninjected. In particular, a novel data augmentation method is utilized to mimic\nthe behavior of watermark triggers. Combining with the distribution alignment\nbetween the normal and perturbed (e.g., occluded) data in the feature space,\nour approach generalizes well on all typical types of trigger contents.

While the definition of interpretability of a classifier can\nvary from case to case, here, by a humanly interpretable classifier we restrict\nit to be expressed in simplistic mathematical terms. As a novel approach, we\nrepresent a classifier as an assembly of simple mathematical rules using a\nnon-linear decision tree (NLDT). Each conditional (non-terminal) node of the\ntree represents a non-linear mathematical rule (split-rule) involving features\nin order to partition the dataset in the given conditional node into two\nnon-overlapping subsets. This partitioning is intended to minimize the impurity\nof the resulting child nodes.

To address this issue, this paper suggests a deep face dictionary\nnetwork (termed as DFDNet) to guide the restoration process of degraded\nobservations. To begin with, we use K-means to generate deep dictionaries for\nperceptually significant face components (\\ie, left/right eyes, nose and mouth)\nfrom high-quality images. Next, with the degraded input, we match and select\nthe most similar component features from their corresponding dictionaries and\ntransfer the high-quality details to the input via the proposed dictionary\nfeature transfer (DFT) block. In particular, component AdaIN is leveraged to\neliminate the style diversity between the input and dictionary features (\\eg,\nillumination), and a confidence score is proposed to adaptively fuse the\ndictionary feature to the input. Finally, multi-scale dictionaries are adopted\nin a progressive manner to enable the coarse-to-fine restoration. Experiments\nshow that our proposed method can achieve plausible performance in both\nquantitative and qualitative evaluation, and more importantly, can generate\nrealistic and promising results on real degraded images without requiring an\nidentity-belonging reference.

The\nterrestrial temperature during Maunder Minimum was reduced by up to 1.0C that\nled to freezing rivers, cold winters and summers. The modern GSM started in\n2020 and will last for three solar cycles until 2053. During this GSM two\nprocesses will affect the input of solar radiation: a decrease of solar\nactivity and an increase in total solar irradiance because of solar inertial\nmotion (SIM). For evaluation of the latter this study uses daily ephemeris of\nthe Sun-Earth (SE) distances in two millennia from 600 to 2600 showing\nsignificant decreases of SE distances in the first 6 months of a year by 0.005\nau in 600 to 1600 and by more than 0.01 au in 1600 to 2600 with consequent\nincreases of SE distances in the second halves of a year. Although, these\nincreases are not fully symmetric in the second millennium (1600 to 2600),\nduring which the longest SE distances are gradually shifted from 21 June to 15\nJuly in 2600 while the shortest ones from 21 December to 15 January. These\ndistance variations impose significant increases of solar irradiance in the\nfirst six months of each year in the two millennia, which are not fully offset\nby the solar radiation decreases in the last six months in millennium 1600 to\n2600. This misbalance creates an annual surplus of solar radiation to be\nprocessed by the terrestrial atmosphere and ocean environments that can lead to\nan increase of terrestrial temperature.

The quick\nmechanical characterization is thus desired for the advanced design of\narchitectured materials.

The measure of elastic isotropy for\narchitectured materials is derived firstly in this paper to construct a\ndatabase with associated images of microstructures.

The local approach to this problem considers each\ntime series separately and fits a function or model to each series. The global\napproach fits a single function to all series. For groups of similar time\nseries, global methods outperform the more established local methods. However,\nrecent results show good performance of global models even in heterogeneous\ndatasets. This suggests a more general applicability of global methods,\npotentially leading to more accurate tools and new scenarios to study.\n  Formalizing the setting of forecasting a set of time series with local and\nglobal methods, we provide the following contributions:\n  1) Global methods are not more restrictive than local methods, both can\nproduce the same forecasts without any assumptions about similarity of the\nseries. Global models can succeed in a wider range of problems than previously\nthought.\n  2) Basic generalization bounds for local and global algorithms. The\ncomplexity of local methods grows with the size of the set while it remains\nconstant for global methods. In large datasets, a global algorithm can afford\nto be quite complex and still benefit from better generalization. These bounds\nserve to clarify and support recent experimental results in the field, and\nguide the design of new algorithms. For the class of autoregressive models,\nthis implies that global models can have much larger memory than local methods.\n  3) In an extensive empirical study, purposely naive algorithms derived from\nthese principles, such as global linear models or deep networks result in\nsuperior accuracy.\n  In particular, global linear models can provide competitive accuracy with two\norders of magnitude fewer parameters than local methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2020 10:22:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 07:37:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 23:34:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

In order to scale learning through interaction to\nmany objects and scenes, robots should be able to improve their own performance\nfrom real-world experience without requiring human supervision. To this end, we\npropose a novel approach for modeling the dynamics of a robot's interactions\ndirectly from unlabeled 3D point clouds and images. Unlike previous approaches,\nour method does not require ground-truth data associations provided by a\ntracker or any pre-trained perception network. To learn from unlabeled\nreal-world interaction data, we enforce consistency of estimated 3D clouds,\nactions and 2D images with observed ones. Our joint forward and inverse network\nlearns to segment a scene into salient object parts and predicts their 3D\nmotion under the effect of applied actions. Moreover, our object-centric model\noutputs action-conditioned 3D scene flow, object masks and 2D optical flow as\nemergent properties. Our extensive evaluation both in simulation and with\nreal-world data demonstrates that our formulation leads to effective,\ninterpretable models that can be used for visuomotor control and planning.\nVideos, code and dataset are available at http://hind4sight.cs.uni-freiburg.de\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2020 11:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

Recently, non-local self-attention based methods are proved to be\neffective for context information collection. Since the desired context\nconsists of spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions, 3D representation is an\nappropriate formulation. However, these non-local methods describe 3D context\ninformation based on a 2D similarity matrix, where space compression may lead\nto channel-wise attention missing. An alternative is to model the contextual\ninformation directly without compression. However, this effort confronts a\nfundamental difficulty, namely the high-rank property of context information.\nIn this paper, we propose a new approach to model the 3D context\nrepresentations, which not only avoids the space compression but also tackles\nthe high-rank difficulty. Here, inspired by tensor canonical-polyadic\ndecomposition theory (i.e, a high-rank tensor can be expressed as a combination\nof rank-1 tensors.), we design a low-rank-to-high-rank context reconstruction\nframework (i.e, RecoNet). Specifically, we first introduce the tensor\ngeneration module (TGM), which generates a number of rank-1 tensors to capture\nfragments of context feature. Then we use these rank-1 tensors to recover the\nhigh-rank context features through our proposed tensor reconstruction module\n(TRM). Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art on\nvarious public datasets. Additionally, our proposed method has more than 100\ntimes less computational cost compared with conventional non-local-based\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2020 14:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

It boosts the performance of a miniaturized student network with\nthe supervision of the output distribution and feature maps from a\nsophisticated teacher network. Some recent works introduce multi-teacher\ndistillation to provide more supervision to the student network. However, the\neffectiveness of multi-teacher distillation methods are accompanied by costly\ncomputation resources. To tackle with both the efficiency and the effectiveness\nof knowledge distillation, we introduce the feature aggregation to imitate the\nmulti-teacher distillation in the single-teacher distillation framework by\nextracting informative supervision from multiple teacher feature maps.\nSpecifically, we introduce DFA, a two-stage Differentiable Feature Aggregation\nsearch method that motivated by DARTS in neural architecture search, to\nefficiently find the aggregations. In the first stage, DFA formulates the\nsearching problem as a bi-level optimization and leverages a novel bridge loss,\nwhich consists of a student-to-teacher path and a teacher-to-student path, to\nfind appropriate feature aggregations. The two paths act as two players against\neach other, trying to optimize the unified architecture parameters to the\nopposite directions while guaranteeing both expressivity and learnability of\nthe feature aggregation simultaneously. In the second stage, DFA performs\nknowledge distillation with the derived feature aggregation.

This thesis develops such a\nsystem for Turkish language. This is accomplished by extending Open Source\nInformation Mining and Analysis (OPTIMA) research group's event extraction\nsoftware, by implementing appropriate extensions in the semantic representation\nformat, by adding a partial grammar which improves the TAM (Tense, Aspect and\nMood) marker, adverb analysis and matching functions of ExPRESS, and by\nconstructing an appropriate lexicon in the standard of CORLEONE.

Compared with the\ntraditional methods, the proposed schemes reduce the complexity of the RIS\nchannel estimation while outperforming the beam training method in terms of\nminimum square error, achievable rate, and outage probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2020 08:34:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 06:45:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-20"}

The full enumeration of a given\ngenotype-phenotype (GP) map is therefore a powerful technique in examining\nevolutionary landscapes. However, because the number of genotypes typically\ngrows exponentially with genome length, such calculations rapidly become\nintractable. Here I apply graphics processing unit(GPU) techniques to the\nhydrophobic-polar (HP)model for protein folding. This GP map is a simple and\nwell-studied model for the complex process of protein folding. Prior studies on\nrelatively small 2D and 3D lattices have been exclusively carried out using\nconventional central processing unit (CPU) approaches. By using GPU techniques,\nI was able to reproduce the pioneering calculations of Li et al.[1] with a\nspeed up of 580-700 fold over a CPU. I was also able to perform the largest\nenumeration to date of the 6x6 lattice. These novel calculations provide\nevidence that a popular \"plum-pudding\" metaphor that suggests that phenotypes\nare disconnected in genotype space does not describe the data. Instead a\n\"spaghetti\" metaphor of connected genotype networks may be more suitable.\nFurthermore, the data allows the relationships between designability and\ncomplexity within GP space to be explored. GPU approaches appear extremely well\nsuited toGP mapping and the success of this work provides a promising\nintroduction for its wider application in this field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2020 22:59:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 16:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

Despite this, Italy has suffered a huge human and social\ncost, especially in Lombardy. The aim of this paper is dual: i) first, to\ninvestigate the reasons of the case fatality rate (CFR) differences across\nItalian 20 regions and 107 provinces, using a multivariate OLS regression\napproach; and ii) second, to build a taxonomy of provinces with similar\nmortality risk of COVID-19, by using the Ward hierarchical agglomerative\nclustering method. I considered health system metrics, environmental pollution,\nclimatic conditions, demographic variables, and three ad hoc indexes that\nrepresent the health system saturation. The results showed that overall health\ncare efficiency, physician density, and average temperature helped to reduce\nthe CFR. By the contrary, population aged 70 and above, car and firm density,\nlevel of air pollutants (NO2, O3, PM10, and PM2.5), relative average humidity,\nCOVID-19 prevalence, and all three indexes of health system saturation were\npositively associated with the CFR. Population density, social vertical\nintegration, and altitude were not statistically significant. In particular,\nthe risk of dying increases with age, as 90 years old and above had a\nthree-fold greater risk than the 80 to 89 years old and four-fold greater risk\nthan 70 to 79 years old. Moreover, the cluster analysis showed that the highest\nmortality risk was concentrated in the north of the country, while the lowest\nrisk was associated with southern provinces. Finally, since prevalence and\nhealth system saturation indexes played the most important role in explaining\nthe CFR variability, a significant part of the latter may have been caused by\nthe massive stress of the Italian health system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2020 22:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-28"}

However, due to the lesser\nconsideration of temporal information, the image saliency deep models may\nbecome fragile in the video sequences dominated by temporal information. Thus,\nthe most recent video saliency detection approaches have adopted the network\narchitecture starting with a spatial deep model that is followed by an\nelaborately designed temporal deep model. However, such methods easily\nencounter the performance bottleneck arising from the single stream learning\nmethodology, so the overall detection performance is largely determined by the\nspatial deep model. In sharp contrast to the current mainstream methods, this\npaper proposes a novel plug-and-play scheme to weakly retrain a pretrained\nimage saliency deep model for video data by using the newly sensed and coded\ntemporal information. Thus, the retrained image saliency deep model will be\nable to maintain temporal saliency awareness, achieving much improved detection\nperformance. Moreover, our method is simple yet effective for adapting any\noff-the-shelf pre-trained image saliency deep model to obtain high-quality\nvideo saliency detection.
