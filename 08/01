In this paper, we propose HMCNAS, which is\ncomposed of two novel components: i) a method that leverages information about\nhuman-designed models to autonomously generate a complex search space, and ii)\nan Evolutionary Algorithm with Bayesian Optimization that is capable of\ngenerating competitive CNNs from scratch, without relying on human-defined\nparameters or small search spaces. The experimental results show that the\nproposed approach results in competitive architectures obtained in a very short\ntime.

However, the high accuracy of these models comes at\nthe expense of a tremendous computation cost. This aspect is almost always\noverlooked in evaluating the quality of proposed models. However, models should\nnot be evaluated without taking into account their complexity. This aspect is\nespecially critical in audio applications, which heavily relies on specialized\nembedded hardware with real-time constraints. In this paper, we build on recent\nobservations that deep models are highly overparameterized, by studying the\nlottery ticket hypothesis on deep generative audio models. This hypothesis\nstates that extremely efficient small sub-networks exist in deep models and\nwould provide higher accuracy than larger models if trained in isolation.\nHowever, lottery tickets are found by relying on unstructured masking, which\nmeans that resulting models do not provide any gain in either disk size or\ninference time. Instead, we develop here a method aimed at performing\nstructured trimming. We show that this requires to rely on global selection and\nintroduce a specific criterion based on mutual information. First, we confirm\nthe surprising result that smaller models provide higher accuracy than their\nlarge counterparts. We further show that we can remove up to 95% of the model\nweights without significant degradation in accuracy. Hence, we can obtain very\nlight models for generative audio across popular methods such as Wavenet, SING\nor DDSP, that are up to 100 times smaller with commensurate accuracy. We study\nthe theoretical bounds for embedding these models on Raspberry Pi and Arduino,\nand show that we can obtain generative models on CPU with equivalent quality as\nlarge GPU models.

While GPUs are an attractive platform in\nterms of performance, the security of these devices raises a number of\nconcerns. One vulnerability is the data-dependent timing information, which can\nbe exploited by adversary to recover the encryption key. Memory system features\nare frequently exploited since they create detectable timing variations. In\nthis paper, our attack model is a coalescing attack, which leverages a critical\nGPU microarchitectural feature -- the coalescing unit. As multiple concurrent\nGPU memory requests can refer to the same cache block, the coalescing unit\ncollapses them into a single memory transaction. The access time of an\nencryption kernel is dependent on the number of transactions. Correlation\nbetween a guessed key value and the associated timing samples can be exploited\nto recover the secret key. In this paper, a series of hardware/software\ncountermeasures are proposed to obfuscate the memory timing side channel,\nmaking the GPU more resilient without impacting performance.

Randomized SVD is adopted in the present analysis to relieve the\ncomputational cost associated with the high-Re global base flow. To examine the\nlocal physics over the LSB, we consider the use of exponential discounting to\nlimit the time horizon that allows for the instability to develop with respect\nto the base flow. With discounting, the gain distribution over frequency\naccurately captures the spectral content over the LSB obtained from flow\nsimulation. The peak-gain frequency also agrees with previous flow control\nresults on suppressing dynamic stall over a pitching airfoil. According to the\ngain distribution and the modal structures, we conclude that the dominant\nenergy-amplification mechanism is the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. In addition\nto discounting, we also examine the use of spatial windows for both the forcing\nand response. From the response-windowed analysis, we find that the LSB serves\nthe main role of energy amplifier, with the amplification saturating at the\nreattachment point. The input window imposes the constraint of surface forcing,\nand the results show that the optimal actuator location is slightly upstream of\nthe separation point.

The\nmodels' addresses challenges associated to different weather conditions,\nocclusion and low-light settings and efficiently extracts vehicle information\nand trajectories through its computationally rich training and feedback cycles.\nThe automatic vehicle counts resulting from all the model combinations are\nvalidated and compared against the manually counted ground truths of over 9\nhours' traffic video data obtained from the Louisiana Department of\nTransportation and Development. Experimental results demonstrate that the\ncombination of CenterNet and Deep SORT, Detectron2 and Deep SORT, and YOLOv4\nand Deep SORT produced the best overall counting percentage for all vehicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 17:49:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}

Examples include living systems, such as assemblies of bacteria and\nbiological tissues, biopolymers driven by molecular motors, and suspensions of\nsynthetic self-propelled particles. A central question in the field is to\nunderstand and control the self-organization of active assemblies in space and\ntime. Most active systems exhibit either spatial order mediated by interactions\nthat coordinate the spatial structure and the motion of active agents or the\ntemporal synchronization of individual oscillatory dynamics. The simultaneous\ncontrol of spatial and temporal organization is more challenging and generally\nrequires complex interactions, such as reaction-diffusion hierarchies or\ngenetically engineered cellular circuits. Here, we report a novel and simple\nmeans to simultaneously control the spatial and temporal self-organization of\nbacterial active matter. By confining an active bacterial suspension and\nmanipulating a single macroscopic parameter, namely the viscoelasticity of the\nsuspending fluid, we have found that the bacterial fluid first self-organizes\nin space into a millimeter-scale rotating vortex; then displays temporal\norganization as the giant vortex switches its global chirality periodically\nwith tunable frequency, reminiscent of a torsional pendulum - a self-driven\none. Combining experiments with an active matter model, we explain this\nstriking behavior in terms of the interplay between active forcing and\nviscoelastic stress relaxation. Our findings advance the understanding of\nbacterial behavior in complex fluids, and demonstrate experimentally for the\nfirst time that rheological properties can be harnessed to control active\nmatter flows. Coupled with actuation, our tunable self-oscillating bacterial\nvortex may be used as a \"clock\" for locomotion of soft robots and microfluidic\npumping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 17:58:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 15:00:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 05:56:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

In this work, we searched the first\n23 months of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data stream for candidate\nkilonovae in the form of rapidly evolving transients. We combined ZTF alert\nqueries with forced point-spread-function photometry and nightly flux stacking\nto increase our sensitivity to faint and fast transients. Automatic queries\nyielded $>11,200$ candidates, 24 of which passed quality checks and strict\nselection criteria based on a grid of kilonova models tailored for both binary\nneutron star and neutron star-black hole mergers. None of the candidates in our\nsample was deemed a possible kilonova after thorough vetting, catalog\ncross-matching, and study of their color evolution. The sources that passed our\nselection criteria are dominated by Galactic cataclysmic variables. In\naddition, we identified two fast transients at high Galactic latitude, one of\nwhich is the confirmed afterglow of long-duration GRB190106A, and the other is\na possible cosmological afterglow.

Computing has changed our world, in\npart, because our innovations can run on computers whose performance and\ncost-performance has improved a million-fold over the last few decades. A\ndriving force behind this has been a repeated doubling of the transistors per\nchip, dubbed Moore's Law. A concomitant enabler has been Dennard Scaling that\nhas permitted these performance doublings at roughly constant power, but, as we\nwill see, both trends face challenges. Consider for a moment the impact of\nthese two trends over the past 30 years. A 1980's supercomputer (e.g. a Cray 2)\nwas rated at nearly 2 Gflops and consumed nearly 200 KW of power. At the time,\nit was used for high performance and national-scale applications ranging from\nweather forecasting to nuclear weapons research. A computer of similar\nperformance now fits in our pocket and consumes less than 10 watts.

What is possible with such a computer in your pocket?\nHow would it change the landscape of high capacity computing?

As consequence, researchers and practitioners face the\nchallenge of how to set these values. Many users have limited knowledge about\nML algorithms and the effect of their HP values and, therefore, do not take\nadvantage of suitable settings. They usually define the HP values by trial and\nerror, which is very subjective, not guaranteed to find good values and\ndependent on the user experience. Tuning techniques search for HP values able\nto maximize the predictive performance of induced models for a given dataset,\nbut have the drawback of a high computational cost. Thus, practitioners use\ndefault values suggested by the algorithm developer or by tools implementing\nthe algorithm. Although default values usually result in models with acceptable\npredictive performance, different implementations of the same algorithm can\nsuggest distinct default values. To maintain a balance between tuning and using\ndefault values, we propose a strategy to generate new optimized default values.\nOur approach is grounded on a small set of optimized values able to obtain\npredictive performance values better than default settings provided by popular\ntools. After performing a large experiment and a careful analysis of the\nresults, we concluded that our approach delivers better default values.\nBesides, it leads to competitive solutions when compared to tuned values,\nmaking it easier to use and having a lower cost.

This problem is particularly pronounced in academic benchmarks like\nMNIST or CIFAR, for which the quality of the labels is high. For the special\ncase of Gaussian process regression, any positive temperature corresponds to a\nvalid posterior under a modified prior, and tuning this temperature is directly\nanalogous to empirical Bayes. On classification tasks, there is no direct\nequivalence between modifying the prior and tuning the temperature, however\nreducing the temperature can lead to models which better reflect our belief\nthat one gains little information by relabeling existing examples in the\ntraining set.

We find that its phase diagram is\nricher than in the Majorana case. In the grand canonical ensemble, we identify\na region of small chemical potential, and weak coupling between the two SYKs,\nfor which two first order thermodynamic phase transitions occur as a function\nof temperature. First, we observe a transition from a cold wormhole phase to an\nintermediate phase that may correspond to a charged wormhole. For a higher\ntemperature, there is another first order transition to the black hole phase.\nAs in the Majorana case, the low temperature wormhole phase is gapped and, for\nsufficiently large coupling between the two complex SYK, or chemical potential,\nthe first order transitions become crossovers. The total charge is good\nindicator to study the phase diagram of the model: it is zero in the cold\nwormhole phase and jumps discontinuously at the temperatures at which the\ntransitions take place. Based on the approximate conformal symmetry of the\nground state, expected to be close to a thermofield double state, we identify\nthe effective low energy action of the model. It is a generalized Schwarzian\naction with $SL(2,R)\\times U(1)$ symmetry with an additional potential and a\nextra degree of freedom related to the charge. In the large $N$ limit, results\nfrom this low energy action are consistent with those from the solution of the\nSD equations.

It consists of expensive, centralized generation via large plants,\nand a massive transmission and distribution system. It strives to deliver\nhigh-quality power to all subscribers simultaneously - no matter what their\ndemand - and must therefore be sized to the peak aggregate demand at each\ndistribution point. Ultimately, the system demands end-to-end synchronization,\nand it lacks a mechanism for storing (\"buffering\") energy, thus complicating\nsharing among grids or independent operation during an \"upstream\" outage.\nRecent blackouts demonstrate the existing grid's problems - failures are rare\nbut spectacular. Moreover, the structure cannot accommodate the highly variable\nnature of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. Many people are\npinning their hopes on the \"smart grid\" - i.e., a more distributed, adaptive,\nand market-based infrastructure for the generation, distribution, and\nconsumption of electrical energy. This new approach is designed to yield\ngreater efficiency and resilience, while reducing environmental impact,\ncompared to the existing electricity distribution system. Initial plans for the\nsmart grid suggest it will make extensive use of existing information\ntechnology. In particular, recent advances in data analytics - i.e., data\nmining, machine learning, etc. - have the potential to greatly enhance the\nsmart grid and, ultimately, amplify its impact, by helping us make sense of an\nincreasing wealth of data about how we use energy and the kinds of demands that\nwe are placing upon the current energy grid. Here we describe what the\nelectricity grid could look like in 10 years, and specifically how Federal\ninvestment in data analytics approaches are critical to realizing this vision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 19:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

Prior work on correlation perception has not\nconsidered how factors including prior beliefs and uncertainty representation\nimpact such judgements. The present work focuses on the impact of uncertainty\ncommunication when judging bivariate visualizations. Specifically, we model how\nusers update their beliefs about variable relationships after seeing a\nscatterplot with and without uncertainty representation. To model and evaluate\nthe belief updating, we present three studies. Study 1 focuses on a proposed\n''Line + Cone'' visual elicitation method for capturing users' beliefs in an\naccurate and intuitive fashion. The findings reveal that our proposed method of\nbelief solicitation reduces complexity and accurately captures the users'\nuncertainty about a range of bivariate relationships. Study 2 leverages the\n``Line + Cone'' elicitation method to measure belief updating on the\nrelationship between different sets of variables when seeing correlation\nvisualization with and without uncertainty representation. We compare changes\nin users beliefs to the predictions of Bayesian cognitive models which provide\nnormative benchmarks for how users should update their prior beliefs about a\nrelationship in light of observed data. The findings from Study 2 revealed that\none of the visualization conditions with uncertainty communication led to users\nbeing slightly more confident about their judgement compared to visualization\nwithout uncertainty information. Study 3 builds on findings from Study 2 and\nexplores differences in belief update when the bivariate visualization is\ncongruent or incongruent with users' prior belief. Our results highlight the\neffects of incorporating uncertainty representation, and the potential of\nmeasuring belief updating on correlation judgement with Bayesian cognitive\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 19:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

Most notably, at design time, FPGA designers commit to a fixed\nallocation of logic resources to modules in a design. At runtime, some of the\noccupied resources could be left idle or under-utilized due to hard-to-avoid\nsources of inefficiencies (e.g., operation dependencies). With partial\nreconfiguration (PR), FPGA resources can be re-allocated over time. Therefore,\nusing PR, a designer can attempt to reduce idleness and under-utilization with\nbetter area-time scheduling.\n  In this paper, we explain when, how, and why PR-style designs can improve\nover the performance-area Pareto front of ASIC-style designs (without PR). We\nfirst introduce the concept of area-time volume to explain why PR-style designs\ncan improve upon ASIC-style designs. We identify resource under-utilization as\nan opportunity that can be exploited by PR-style designs. We then present a\nfirst-order analytical model to help a designer decide if a PR-style design can\nbe beneficial. When it is the case, the model points to the most suitable PR\nexecution strategy and provides an estimate of the improvement.

However, many prostate cancers have subtle features which are\nnot easily identifiable on MRI, resulting in missed diagnoses and alarming\nvariability in radiologist interpretation. Machine learning models have been\ndeveloped in an effort to improve cancer identification, but current models\nlocalize cancer using MRI-derived features, while failing to consider the\ndisease pathology characteristics observed on resected tissue. In this paper,\nwe propose CorrSigNet, an automated two-step model that localizes prostate\ncancer on MRI by capturing the pathology features of cancer. First, the model\nlearns MRI signatures of cancer that are correlated with corresponding\nhistopathology features using Common Representation Learning.

Recently proposed neural excitation\nvocoders can realize qualified waveform generation by combining a vocal tract\nfilter with a WaveNet-based glottal excitation generator. However, when these\nvocoders are used in a TTS system, the quality of synthesized speech is often\ndegraded owing to a mismatch between training and synthesis steps.\nSpecifically, the vocoder is separately trained from an acoustic model\nfront-end. Therefore, estimation errors of the acoustic model are inevitably\nboosted throughout the synthesis process of the vocoder back-end. To address\nthis problem, we propose to incorporate an MbG structure into the vocoder's\ntraining process. In the proposed method, the excitation signal is extracted by\nthe acoustic model's generated spectral parameters, and the neural vocoder is\nthen optimized not only to learn the target excitation's distribution but also\nto compensate for the estimation errors occurring from the acoustic model.\nFurthermore, as the generated spectral parameters are shared in the training\nand synthesis steps, their mismatch conditions can be reduced effectively. The\nexperimental results verify that the proposed system provides high-quality\nsynthetic speech by achieving a mean opinion score of 4.57 within the TTS\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2020 00:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

The ER model is\ncomposed of three fundamental categories (i.e., entity, relationship and\nattribute), whereas TM is built from one ontological category called the\nthing/machine (thimac). Several ER diagrams are re-casted as TM diagrams,\ncreating a categorical collision with interesting implications regarding the\nstatus of the conception of relationship in a conceptual model. The re-modeling\nshows that the relational construct is dissipated into TM flows of things and\nchronology of events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2020 00:37:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

One interesting question that has yet to be fully explored is\nthe bias-variance relationship of adversarial machine learning, which can\npotentially provide deeper insights into this behaviour. The notion of bias and\nvariance is one of the main approaches to analyze and evaluate the\ngeneralization and reliability of a machine learning model. Although it has\nbeen extensively used in other machine learning models, it is not well explored\nin the field of deep learning and it is even less explored in the area of\nadversarial machine learning.\n  In this study, we investigate the effect of adversarial machine learning on\nthe bias and variance of a trained deep neural network and analyze how\nadversarial perturbations can affect the generalization of a network. We derive\nthe bias-variance trade-off for both classification and regression applications\nbased on two main loss functions: (i) mean squared error (MSE), and (ii)\ncross-entropy. Furthermore, we perform quantitative analysis with both\nsimulated and real data to empirically evaluate consistency with the derived\nbias-variance tradeoffs. Our analysis sheds light on why the deep neural\nnetworks have poor performance under adversarial perturbation from a\nbias-variance point of view and how this type of perturbation would change the\nperformance of a network. Moreover, given these new theoretical findings, we\nintroduce a new adversarial machine learning algorithm with lower computational\ncomplexity than well-known adversarial machine learning strategies (e.g., PGD)\nwhile providing a high success rate in fooling deep neural networks in lower\nperturbation magnitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2020 00:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

They often view an\napplication as a direct acyclic graph with streams flowing through pipelined\ninstances of various processing units. One key challenge that emerges is\ninstance placement, i.e., to decide the placement of instances across servers\nwith minimum traffic across servers and maximum resource utilization. The\nchallenge roots in not only its intrinsic complexity but also the impact\nbetween successive application deployments. Most updated engines such as Apache\nHeron exploits a more modularized scheduler design that decomposes the task\ninto two stages: One decides the instance-to-container mapping while the other\nfocuses on the container-to-server mapping that is delegated to standalone\nresource managers. The unaligned objectives and scheduler designs in the two\nstages may lead to long response times or low utilization. However, so far\nlittle work has appeared to address the challenge. Inspired by the recent\nsuccess of applications of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods in various\nfields, we develop a novel model to characterize such systems, formulate the\nproblem, and cast each stage of mapping into a sequential decision process. By\nadopting MCTS methods, we propose MIPS, an MCTS-based Instance Placement Scheme\nto decide the two-staged mapping in a timely yet efficient manner. In addition,\nwe discuss practical issues and refine MIPS to further improve its performance.\nResults from extensive simulations show, given mild-value of samples, MIPS\noutperforms existing schemes with a significant traffic reduction and\nutilization improvement. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to\nstudy the two-staged mapping problem and to apply MCTS to solving the\nchallenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2020 03:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

This interplay consequently serves as a potential platform\nfor interdisciplinary studies. To continue this line, we analyze the role of\ndynamical resources in a communication setup, and further apply our analysis to\nthermodynamics. To start with, we study classical communication scenarios\nconstrained by a given resource, in the sense that the information processing\nchannel is unable to supply additional amounts of the resource. We show that\nthe one-shot classical capacity is upper bounded by resource preservability,\nwhich is a measure of the ability to preserve the resource. A lower bound can\nbe further obtained when the resource is asymmetry. As an application,\nunexpectedly, under a recently-studied thermalization model, we found that the\nsmallest bath size needed to thermalize all outputs of a Gibbs-preserving\ncoherence-annihilating channel upper bounds its one-shot classical capacity.\nWhen the channel is coherence non-generating, the upper bound is given by a sum\nof coherence preservability and the bath size of the channel's incoherent\nversion. In this sense, bath sizes can be interpreted as the thermodynamic cost\nof transmitting classical information. This finding provides a dynamical\nanalogue of Landauer's principle, and therefore bridges classical communication\nand thermodynamics. As another implication, we show that, in bipartite\nsettings, classically correlated local baths can admit classical communication\neven when both local systems are completely thermalized. Hence, thermalizations\ncan transmit information by accessing only classical correlation as a resource.\nOur results demonstrate interdisciplinary applications enabled by dynamical\nresource theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2020 06:32:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 03:23:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 14:41:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 06:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Most existing methods either extract hand-crafted descriptors or\nlearn action representations by supervised learning paradigms that require\nmassive labeled data. In this paper, we for the first time propose a\ncontrastive action learning paradigm named AS-CAL that can leverage different\naugmentations of unlabeled skeleton data to learn action representations in an\nunsupervised manner. Specifically, we first propose to contrast similarity\nbetween augmented instances (query and key) of the input skeleton sequence,\nwhich are transformed by multiple novel augmentation strategies, to learn\ninherent action patterns (\"pattern-invariance\") of different skeleton\ntransformations. Second, to encourage learning the pattern-invariance with more\nconsistent action representations, we propose a momentum LSTM, which is\nimplemented as the momentum-based moving average of LSTM based query encoder,\nto encode long-term action dynamics of the key sequence. Third, we introduce a\nqueue to store the encoded keys, which allows our model to flexibly reuse\nproceeding keys and build a more consistent dictionary to improve contrastive\nlearning. Last, by temporally averaging the hidden states of action learned by\nthe query encoder, a novel representation named Contrastive Action Encoding\n(CAE) is proposed to represent human's action effectively.

The design is challenging because of various uncertainties\nmanifested in fog computing systems; e.g., tasks' resource demands remain\nunknown before their actual arrivals. Recent works have applied deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to conduct online task scheduling and\nimprove various objectives. However, they overlook the multi-resource fairness\nfor different tasks, which is key to achieving fair resource sharing among\ntasks but in general non-trivial to achieve.

Moreover, they are necessary\nand sufficient to get filtered interpolating polynomials with a near best\napproximation error, which tends to zero as the number $n$ of nodes tends to\ninfinity. In addition, the convergence rate is comparable with the error of\nbest polynomial approximation of degree $n$, hence the approximation order\nimproves with the smoothness of the sought function. Several numerical\nexperiments are given in order to test the theoretical results, to make a\ncomparison with the Lagrange interpolation at the same nodes and to show how\nthe Gibbs phenomenon can be strongly reduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2020 10:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

One way to construct a\ncooperative Nash equilibrium is to find a `friendly-rivalry' strategy, which\naims at full cooperation but never allows the co-players to be better off.\nRecently it has been shown that for the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma in the\npresence of error, a friendly rival can be designed with the following five\nrules: Cooperate if everyone did, accept punishment for your own mistake,\npunish defection, recover cooperation if you find a chance, and defect in all\nthe other circumstances. In this work, we construct such a friendly-rivalry\nstrategy for the iterated $n$-person public-goods game by generalizing those\nfive rules.

We compute the quantities relevant to\nsemiclassical exciton dynamics for several interesting examples of bilayer\nsystems with weak interlayer tunneling and Fermi energy in a gap, where the\nexciton may be sensibly described as a two-body problem. These quantities\ninclude the exciton dispersion, its dipole curvature, and Berry's curvature.\nFor two gapped-graphene layers in a vanishing magnetic field, we find the\ndipole curvature vanishes if the layers are identical, but may be non-zero when\nthe layers differ. We further analyze examples in the presence of magnetic\nfields, allowing us to examine cases involving graphene, in which a gap is\nopened by Landau level splitting. Heterostructures involving TMDs are also\nconsidered. In each case the dipole and/or Berry's curvatures play out\ndifferently. In some cases, the lowest energy exciton state is found to reside\nat finite momentum, with interesting possibilities for Bose condensation.

Synthetic Biology exploits gene\nor/and protein regulatory networks towards the design of oscillatory networks\nfor producing useful compounds.

It is known that\nnetwork-level interactions involve more than one type of biomolecule as well as\nbiological processes operating at multiple omic levels. Combining\nnetwork/pathway-level information with genetic information it is possible to\ndescribe well-understood or unknown bacterial mechanisms and organism-specific\ndynamics. Results: Network multi-omic integration has led to the discovery of\ninteresting oscillatory signals. Following the methodologies used in signal\nprocessing and communication engineering, a new methodology is introduced to\nidentify and quantify the extent of the multi-omic oscillations of the signal.\nNew signal metrics are designed to allow further biotechnological explanations\nand provide important clues about the oscillatory nature of the pathways and\ntheir regulatory circuits.

The motivation of our\nstudy is the log-rank conjecture for XOR functions and its connection to\nFourier analysis and parity decision tree complexity. Let f be a Boolean\nfunction with Fourier support S and Fourier sparsity k.\n  1) We prove via the probabilistic method that there exists a parity decision\ntree of depth O(sqrt k) that computes f. This matches the best known upper\nbound on the parity decision tree complexity of Boolean functions (Tsang, Wong,\nXie, and Zhang, FOCS 2013). Moreover, while previous constructions (Tsang et\nal., FOCS 2013, Shpilka, Tal, and Volk, Comput. Complex. 2017) build the trees\nby carefully choosing the parities to be queried in each step, our proof shows\nthat a naive sampling of the parities suffices.\n  2) We generalize the above result by showing that if the Fourier spectra of\nBoolean functions satisfy a natural \"folding property\", then the above proof\ncan be adapted to establish existence of a tree of complexity polynomially\nsmaller than O(sqrt k). We make a conjecture in this regard which, if true,\nimplies that the communication complexity of an XOR function is bounded above\nby the fourth root of the rank of its communication matrix, improving upon the\npreviously known upper bound of square root of rank (Tsang et al., FOCS 2013,\nLovett, J.

Particularly, existing\napproaches do not consider how to collect relevant source code samples from\nwhich to infer patterns. In fact, an inadequate collection can cause API usage\npattern miners to infer irrelevant patterns which leads to false alarms instead\nof finding true API misuses. In this paper, we target this problem (a) by\nproviding a method that increases the likelihood of finding relevant and\ntrue-positive patterns concerning a given set of code changes and agnostic to a\nconcrete static, intra-procedural mining technique and (b) by introducing a\nconcept for just-in-time API misuse detection which analyzes changes at the\ntime of commit. Particularly, we introduce different, lightweight code search\nand filtering strategies and evaluate them on two real-world API misuse\ndatasets to determine their usefulness in finding relevant intra-procedural API\nusage patterns. Our main results are (1) commit-based search with subsequent\nfiltering effectively decreases the amount of code to be analyzed, (2) in\nparticular method-level filtering is superior to file-level filtering, (3)\nproject-internal and project-external code search find solutions for different\ntypes of misuses and thus are complementary, (4) incorporating prior knowledge\nof the misused [...]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2020 15:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 07:25:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 16:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

We assume that\nagents have linear disutility (cost) functions. Like for the case of goods,\ncompetitive division is known to be arguably the best mechanism for the bads as\nwell. However, unlike goods, there are multiple competitive divisions with very\ndifferent disutility value profiles in bads. Although all competitive divisions\nsatisfy the standard notions of fairness and efficiency, some divisions are\nsignificantly fairer and efficient than the others. This raises two important\nnatural questions: Does there exist a competitive division in which no agent is\nassigned a chore that she hugely dislikes? Are there simple sufficient\nconditions for the existence and polynomial-time algorithms assuming them?\n  We investigate both these questions in this paper. We show that the first\nproblem is strongly NP-hard. Further, we derive a simple sufficient condition\nfor the existence, and we show that finding a competitive division is PPAD-hard\nassuming the condition. These results are in sharp contrast to the case of\ngoods where both problems are strongly polynomial-time solvable.

These effects are not well-captured with static travel demand\nmodels. We calibrate and validate the first open-source multi-agent simulation\nmodel for New York City, called MATSim-NYC, to support agencies in evaluating\npolicies such as congestion pricing. The simulation-based virtual test bed is\nloaded with an 8M+ synthetic 2016 population calibrated in a prior study. The\nroad network is calibrated to INRIX speed data and average annual daily traffic\nfor a screenline along the East River crossings, resulting in average speed\ndifferences of 7.2% on freeways and 17.1% on arterials, leading to average\ndifference of +1.8% from the East River screenline. Validation against transit\nstations shows an 8% difference from observed counts and median difference of\n29% for select road link counts. The model is used to evaluate a congestion\npricing plan proposed by the Regional Plan Association and suggests a much\nhigher (127K) car trip reduction compared to their report (59K). The pricing\npolicy would impact the population segment making trips within Manhattan\ndifferently from the population segment of trips outside Manhattan. The\nmultiagent simulation can show that 37.3% of the Manhattan segment would be\nnegatively impacted by the pricing compared to 39.9% of the non-Manhattan\nsegment, which has implications for redistribution of congestion pricing\nrevenues. The citywide travel consumer surplus decreases when the congestion\npricing goes up from $9.18 to $14 both ways even as it increases for the\nCharging-related population segment.
