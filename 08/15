In contrast to the most existing pair-wised temporal link annotation,\nReimers et al.(2016) proposed to annotate the time anchor (a.k.a. the exact\ntime) of each event. Their work represents time anchors with discrete\nrepresentations of Single-Day/Multi-Day and Certain/Uncertain. This increases\nthe complexity of modeling the temporal relations between two time anchors,\nwhich cannot be categorized into the relations of Allen's interval algebra\n(Allen, 1990).\n  In this paper, we propose an effective method to decompose such complex\ntemporal relations into sub-level relations by introducing a unified quadruple\nrepresentation for both Single-Day/Multi-Day and Certain/Uncertain time\nanchors. The temporal relation classifiers are trained in a multi-label\nclassification manner. The system structure of our approach is much simpler\nthan the existing decision tree model (Reimers et al., 2018), which is composed\nby a dozen of node classifiers. Another contribution of this work is to\nconstruct a larger event time corpus (256 news documents) with a reasonable\nInter-Annotator Agreement (IAA), for the purpose of overcoming the data\nshortage of the existing event time corpus (36 news documents). The empirical\nresults show our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art decision tree model\nand the increase of data size obtained a significant improvement of\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 16:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

The network learns a\nmapping from source to target subsets, and implicitly learns to consolidate the\npoint cloud. During inference, the network is fed with random subsets of points\nfrom the input, which it displaces to synthesize a consolidated point set. We\nleverage the inductive bias of neural networks to eliminate noise and outliers,\na notoriously difficult problem in point cloud consolidation.

Under this assumption, any\nbenefit from treatment would be mediated through the post-randomization\nvariable being conditioned upon, and would be directly attributable to neither\nthe randomization itself nor its latent descendants. Recently, there has been\ninterest in mobile health interventions to provide healthcare support; such\nstudies can feature one-way content and/or two-way content, the latter of which\nallowing subjects to engage with the intervention in a way that can be\nobjectively measured on a subject-specific level (e.g., proportion of text\nmessages receiving a response). It is hence highly likely that a benefit\nachieved by the intervention could be explained in part by receipt of the\nintervention content and in part by engaging with/responding to it. When\nseeking to characterize average causal effects conditional on\npost-randomization engagement, the exclusion restriction is therefore all but\nsurely violated. In this paper, we propose a conceptually intuitive sensitivity\nanalysis procedure for this setting that gives rise to sharp bounds on local\naverage treatment effects.

We find\nthat the signals from KK graviton are significantly different than in the\nstandard warped model. This is because the usually dominant decay modes of KK\ngravitons into top quark, Higgs and longitudinal $W/Z$ particles are suppressed\nby the above spatial separation between these two sets of particles, thus other\ndecay channels are allowed to shine themselves. In particular, we focus on two\nnovel decay channels of the KK graviton. The first one is the decay into a pair\nof radions, each of which decays (dominantly) into a pair of SM gluons,\nresulting in a resonant 4-jet final state consisting of two pairs of dijet\nresonance. On the other hand, if the radion is heavier and/or KK gluon is\nlighter, then the KK graviton mostly decays into a KK gluon and a SM gluon. The\nresulting KK gluon has a significant decay branching fraction into radion and\nSM gluon, thereby generating (again) a 4-jet signature, but with a different\nunderlying event topology, i.e., featuring now three different resonances.

Various studies from the classification\nliterature consider all unlabelled instances as negative examples. However, a\nclassification model that learns to classify binary instances with incomplete\npositive labels while assuming all unlabelled data to be negative examples will\noften generate a biased classifier. In this work, we propose a novel Negative\nConfidence-aware Weakly Supervised approach (NCWS), which customises a binary\nclassification loss function by discriminating the unlabelled examples with\ndifferent negative confidences during the classifier's training. We use the\nreview helpfulness classification as a test case for examining the\neffectiveness of our NCWS approach. We thoroughly evaluate NCWS by using three\ndifferent datasets, namely one from Yelp (venue reviews), and two from Amazon\n(Kindle and Electronics reviews). Our results show that NCWS outperforms strong\nbaselines from the literature including an existing SVM-based approach (i.e.\nSVM-P), the positive and unlabelled learning-based approach (i.e. C-PU) and the\npositive confidence-based approach (i.e. P-conf) in addressing the classifier's\nbias problem. Moreover, we further examine the effectiveness of NCWS by using\nits classified helpful reviews in a state-of-the-art review-based venue\nrecommendation model (i.e. DeepCoNN) and demonstrate the benefits of using NCWS\nin enhancing venue recommendation effectiveness in comparison to the baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 17:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

While for two-player zero-sum\ngames, coordinate-ascent approaches (optimizing one agent's policy at a time,\ne.g., self-play) work with guarantees, in multi-agent cooperative setting they\noften converge to sub-optimal Nash equilibrium. On the other hand, directly\nmodeling joint policy changes in imperfect information game is nontrivial due\nto complicated interplay of policies (e.g., upstream updates affect downstream\nstate reachability). In this paper, we show global changes of game values can\nbe decomposed to policy changes localized at each information set, with a novel\nterm named policy-change density. Based on this, we propose Joint Policy\nSearch(JPS) that iteratively improves joint policies of collaborative agents in\nimperfect information games, without re-evaluating the entire game. On\nmulti-agent collaborative tabular games, JPS is proven to never worsen\nperformance and can improve solutions provided by unilateral approaches (e.g,\nCFR), outperforming algorithms designed for collaborative policy learning (e.g.\nBAD). Furthermore, for real-world games, JPS has an online form that naturally\nlinks with gradient updates. We test it to Contract Bridge, a 4-player\nimperfect-information game where a team of $2$ collaborates to compete against\nthe other. In its bidding phase, players bid in turn to find a good contract\nthrough a limited information channel. Based on a strong baseline agent that\nbids competitive bridge purely through domain-agnostic self-play, JPS improves\ncollaboration of team players and outperforms WBridge5, a championship-winning\nsoftware, by $+0.63$ IMPs (International Matching Points) per board over 1k\ngames, substantially better than previous SoTA ($+0.41$ IMPs/b) under\nDouble-Dummy evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 17:58:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 02:35:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 17:14:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:09:48 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2020 01:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

While ablation itself is too weak to significantly\nreduce the mass of the companion star, the ablated wind couples to its magnetic\nfield, removes orbital angular momentum, and thus maintains stable Roche-lobe\noverflow. We use the MESA stellar evolution code, complemented by analytic\nestimates, to track initially main sequence companions as they are reduced to a\nfraction of their original mass by this ablation-driven magnetic braking.

The\ncavity-mediated electron-electron interactions are long range, which has two\nmain effects: firstly, within the standard BCS-type pairing mediated by\nadiabatic photons, the superconducting critical temperature depends\npolynomially on the coupling strength, instead of the exponential dependence\ncharacterizing the phonon-mediated pairing; secondly, as we show here, the\neffect of photon fluctuations is significantly enhanced. These mediate novel\nnon-BCS-type pairing processes, via non-adiabatic photons, which are not\nsensitive to the electron occupation but rather to the electron dispersion and\nlifetime at the Fermi surface. Therefore, while the leading temperature\ndependence of BCS pairing comes from the smoothening of the Fermi-Dirac\ndistribution, the temperature dependence of the fluctuation-induced pairing\ncomes from the electron lifetime. For realistic parameters, also including\ncavity loss, this results into a critical temperature which can be more than\none order of magnitude larger than the BCS prediction. Moreover, a finite\naverage number photons (as can be achieved by incoherently pumping the cavity)\nadds to the fluctuations and leads to a further enhancement of the critical\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 00:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-15"}

This\nmeans that the clogging phenomenon occurs at all the sites in the long-time\nstationary state, and we also discuss its origin.

Such a dynamic\noptimization framework has several benefits: (1) First, it can accurately\nidentify and aggressively remove per-input feature redundancy with considering\nthe model-input interaction; (2) Meanwhile, it can maximally remove the feature\nmap redundancy in various dimensions thanks to the multi-dimension flexibility;\n(3) The training-testing co-optimization favors the dynamic pruning and helps\nmaintain the model accuracy even with very high feature pruning ratio.\nExtensive experiments show that our method could bring 37.4% to 54.5% FLOPs\nreduction with negligible accuracy drop on various of test networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 18:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

We refer\nto this problem as sketch-guided object localization. This problem is\ndistinctively different from the traditional sketch-based image retrieval task\nwhere the gallery set often contains images with only one object. The\nsketch-guided object localization proves to be more challenging when we\nconsider the following: (i) the sketches used as queries are abstract\nrepresentations with little information on the shape and salient attributes of\nthe object, (ii) the sketches have significant variability as they are\nhand-drawn by a diverse set of untrained human subjects, and (iii) there exists\na domain gap between sketch queries and target natural images as these are\nsampled from very different data distributions. To address the problem of\nsketch-guided object localization, we propose a novel cross-modal attention\nscheme that guides the region proposal network (RPN) to generate object\nproposals relevant to the sketch query. These object proposals are later scored\nagainst the query to obtain final localization. Our method is effective with as\nlittle as a single sketch query. Moreover, it also generalizes well to object\ncategories not seen during training and is effective in localizing multiple\nobject instances present in the image. Furthermore, we extend our framework to\na multi-query setting using novel feature fusion and attention fusion\nstrategies introduced in this paper. The localization performance is evaluated\non publicly available object detection benchmarks, viz. MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC,\nwith sketch queries obtained from `Quick, Draw!'.

In such problems, it is the case that the smallest length-scale of\nthe systems dynamics controls the numerical resolution required to effectively\nresolve the embedded physics. In practice however, high numerical resolutions\nis only required in a confined region of the system where fast dynamics or\nlocalized material variability are exhibited, whereas a coarser discretization\ncan be sufficient in the rest majority of the system. To this end, a unified\ncomputational scheme with uniform spatio-temporal resolutions for uncertainty\nquantification can be very computationally demanding. Partitioning the complex\ndynamical system into smaller easier-to-solve problems based of the localized\ndynamics and material variability can reduce the overall computational cost.\nHowever, identifying the region of interest for high-resolution and intensive\nuncertainty quantification can be a problem dependent. The region of interest\ncan be specified based on the localization features of the solution, user\ninterest, and correlation length of the random material properties.

In this work we solved the Einstein equations\nfor the Alcubierre warp drive spacetime geometry considering the dust matter\ndistribution as source, since the Alcubierre metric was not originally advanced\nas a solution of the Einstein equations, but as a spacetime geometry proposed\nwithout a source gravity field. We found out that all Einstein equations\nsolutions of this geometry containing pressureless dust lead to vacuum\nsolutions. We also concluded that these solutions connect the Alcubierre metric\nto the Burgers equation, which describes shock waves moving through an inviscid\nfluid. Our results also indicated that these shock waves behave as plane waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 19:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

To this end, vorticity, particle\nresidence time (PRT), particle's final position (FP) and finite time Lyapunov's\nexponents (FTLE) were computed from the experimental fluid velocity fields\nacquired using ultrasonic particle imaging velocimetry (Echo-PIV). For the\nexperiments, CT-images were used to create morphological realistic models of\nthe descending aorta with 0%, 35% and 50% occlusion degree with same mechanical\nproperties as real arteries. Each model was connected to a circuit with a\npulsatile programmable pump which mimics physiological flow and pressure\nconditions. The pulsatile frequency was set to 0.9 Hz (55 bpm) and the upstream\npeak Reynolds number (Re) was changed from 1100 to 2000. Flow in the\npost-stenotic region was composed of two main structures: a high velocity jet\nover the stenosis throat and a recirculation region behind the stenosis where\nvortex form and shed. We characterized vortex kinematics showing that vortex\npropagation velocity increases with Re. Moreover, from the FTLE field we\nidentified Lagrangian Coherent Structures (i.e. material barriers) that dictate\ntransport behind the stenosis. The size and strength of those barriers\nincreased with Re and the occlusion degree. Finally, from the PRT and FP, we\nshowed that independently of Re, the same amount of fluid remains on the\nstenosis over more than a pulsatile period, which combined with large FTLE\nvalues may provide an alternative way to understand stenosis growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 21:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

The\ngraph is decomposed into two parts, one consisting of independent clusters of\nconnected components, and the other containing edges that connect different\nclusters.

Yet, existing attacks rely on\na set of assumptions that are unrealistic in practice: for example, they (i)\nrequire a large number of queries to be issued by the user, or (ii) assume\ncertain distributions on the queries or underlying data (e.g., that the queries\nare distributed uniformly at random, or that the database does not contain\nmissing values).\n  In this work, we present new attacks for recovering the content of individual\nuser queries, assuming no leakage from the system except the number of results\nand avoiding the limiting assumptions above. Unlike prior attacks, our attacks\nrequire only a single query to be issued by the user for recovering the\nkeyword. Furthermore, our attacks make no assumptions about the distribution of\nissued queries or the underlying data. Instead, our key insight is to exploit\nthe behavior of real-world applications.\n  We start by surveying 11 applications to identify two key characteristics\nthat can be exploited by attackers: (i) file injection, and (ii) automatic\nquery replay. We present attacks that leverage these two properties in concert\nwith volume leakage, independent of the details of any encrypted database\nsystem.

Two cases are addressed, that is, the global operator is sum\nseparable and block separable. For this first case, the global operator is the\nsum of local operators, which are assumed to be Lipschitz, and each local\noperator is privately known to each individual agent. To deal with this\nscenario, a distributed (or decentralized) algorithm, called Distributed\nquasi-averaged Operator Tracking algorithm (DOT), is proposed and rigorously\nanalyzed, and it is shown that the algorithm can converge to a fixed point of\nthe global operator at a linear rate under a linear regularity condition, which\nis strictly weaker than the strong convexity assumption on cost functions in\nexisting convex optimization literature.

Based on the\npredictions of nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration theory, we model the\ncosmic-ray proton (CRP) production by both pre-SN stellar winds (SWs) and\nsupernova remnants (SNRs) from core-collapse SNe inside the starburst nucleus.\nAdopting different models for the transport of CRPs, we estimate the\n$\\gamma$-ray and neutrino emissions due to $pp$ collisions from nearby SBGs\nsuch as M82, NGC253, and Arp220. We find that with the current $\\gamma$-rays\nobservations by Fermi-LAT, Veritas, and H.E.S.S., it would be difficult to\nconstrain CRP production and transport models. Yet, the observations are better\nreproduced with (1) the combination of the single power-law (PL) momentum\ndistribution for SNR-produced CRPs and the diffusion model in which the CRP\ndiffusion is mediated by the strong Kolmogorov-type turbulence of $\\delta\nB/B\\sim1$, and (2) the combination of the double PL model for SNR-produced CRPs\nand the diffusion model in which the scattering of CRPs is controlled mostly by\nself-excited waves rather than the pre-existing turbulence. The contribution of\nSW-produced CRPs could be substantial in Arp220, where the star formation rate\nis higher and the slope of the initial mass function would be flatter. We\nsuggest that M82 and NGC253 might be detectable as point sources of high-energy\nneutrinos in the upcoming KM3NET and IceCube-Gen2, when optimistic models are\napplied. Future observations of neutrinos as well as $\\gamma$-rays would\nprovide constraints for the production and diffusion of CRPs in SBGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 04:39:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 04:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

To overcome this difficulty, we propose\na novel method called BroadFace, which is a learning process to consider a\nmassive set of identities, comprehensively. In BroadFace, a linear classifier\nlearns optimal decision boundaries among identities from a large number of\nembedding vectors accumulated over past iterations. By referring more instances\nat once, the optimality of the classifier is naturally increased on the entire\ndatasets. Thus, the encoder is also globally optimized by referring the weight\nmatrix of the classifier.

BroadFace\ncan be easily applied on many existing methods to accelerate a learning process\nand obtain a significant improvement in accuracy without extra computational\nburden at inference stage. We perform extensive ablation studies and\nexperiments on various datasets to show the effectiveness of BroadFace, and\nalso empirically prove the validity of our compensation method.

This is arguably due to its attractive\nmodeling-grounding-solving workflow that provides an easy approach to problem\nsolving, even for laypersons outside computer science. Unlike this, the high\ndegree of sophistication of the underlying technology makes it increasingly\nhard for ASP experts to put ideas into practice.\n  For addressing this issue, this tutorial aims at enabling users to build\ntheir own ASP-based systems. More precisely, we show how the ASP system CLINGO\ncan be used for extending ASP and for implementing customized special-purpose\nsystems. To this end, we propose two alternatives. We begin with a traditional\nAI technique and show how meta programming can be used for extending ASP. This\nis a rather light approach that relies on CLINGO's reification feature to use\nASP itself for expressing new functionalities. Unlike this, the major part of\nthis tutorial uses traditional programming (in PYTHON) for manipulating CLINGO\nvia its application programming interface. This approach allows for changing\nand controlling the entire model-ground-solve workflow of ASP. Central to this\nis CLINGO's new Application class that allows us to draw on CLINGO's\ninfrastructure by customizing processes similar to the one in CLINGO. For\ninstance, we may engage manipulations to programs' abstract syntax trees,\ncontrol various forms of multi-shot solving, and set up theory propagators for\nforeign inferences.

An appropriate model of the\nspectral data leads to the concept of Compton scattering tomography (CST).\nMultiple-order scattering constitutes the major difficulty of CST. It is, in\ngeneral, impossible to know how many times a photon was scattered before being\nmeasured. In the literature, this nature of the spectral data has often been\neluded by considering only the first-order scattering in models of the spectral\ndata.

In\nthis paper we focus on preparing arbitrary spin eigenstates whose subset\ncontain important entangled resources like Dicke states as well as some other\nsub-radiant states that are difficult to prepare. Leveraging on the symmetry of\nthese states we consider uniform pairwise exchange coupling between every pair\nof qubits. Starting from a product state of a given spin eigenstate with a\nsingle qubit state, another spin eigenstate can be prepared using simple time\nevolutions. This expansion paves a deterministic approach to prepare arbitrary\nDicke states in linear steps. We discuss an improvement in this cost building\nup on a previous work for W states deterministic preparation in logarithmic\ncircuit depth. The modified algorithm requires several iterations of pumping\nspin angular momentum into the system and is akin to the amplitude\namplification in Grover search. As a use case to demonstrate the proposed\nscheme, we choose a system of non-interacting static spin qubits connected to a\nferromagnetic reservoir. The flying qubits emerging from the reservoir locally\ninteract with static qubits successively, mediating an in-direct exchange\ninteraction between all the pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 11:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

However, due to the\nresource-constrained nature of the sensor nodes, it is a challenge to process a\nlarge amount of sensed vibration data in real-time. Existing mechanisms of data\nprocessing are centralized and use cloud or remote servers to analyze the data\nto characterize the state of the bridge, i.e., healthy or damaged. These\nmethods are feasible for wired-SHM systems, however, transmitting huge\ndata-sets in WSNs has been found to be arduous. In this paper, we propose a\nmechanism named as ``in-network damage detection on edge (INDDE)\" which\nextracts the statistical features from raw acceleration measurements\ncorresponding to the healthy condition of the bridge and use them to train a\nprobabilistic model, i.e., estimating the probability density function (PDF) of\nmultivariate Gaussian distribution. The trained model helps to identify the\nanomalous behaviour of the new data points collected from the unknown condition\nof the bridge in real-time. Each edge device classifies the condition of the\nbridge as either \"healthy\" or \"damaged\" around its deployment region depending\non their respective trained model. Experimentation results showcase a promising\n96-100% damage detection accuracy with the advantage of no data transmission\nfrom sensor nodes to the cloud for processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 14:23:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

This makes them\nvery well suited for high-fidelity simulation based aerodynamic shape\noptimization of highly parametrized geometries such as aircraft wings. However,\nthe development of adjoint-based solvers involve careful mathematical treatment\nand their implementation require detailed software development. Furthermore,\nthey can become prohibitively expensive when multiple optimization problems are\nbeing solved, each requiring multiple restarts to circumvent local optima. In\nthis work, we propose a machine learning enabled, surrogate-based framework\nthat replaces the expensive adjoint solver, without compromising on predicting\npredictive accuracy. Specifically, we first train a deep neural network (DNN)\nfrom training data generated from evaluating the high-fidelity simulation model\non a model-agnostic, design of experiments on the geometry shape parameters.\nThe optimum shape may then be computed by using a gradient-based optimizer\ncoupled with the trained DNN. Subsequently, we also perform a gradient-free\nBayesian optimization, where the trained DNN is used as the prior mean. We\nobserve that the latter framework (DNN-BO) improves upon the DNN-only based\noptimization strategy for the same computational cost. Overall, this framework\npredicts the true optimum with very high accuracy, while requiring far fewer\nhigh-fidelity function calls compared to the adjoint-based method. Furthermore,\nwe show that multiple optimization problems can be solved with the same machine\nlearning model with high accuracy, to amortize the offline costs associated\nwith constructing our models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 15:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

Also, the presented method imposes upper bounds on the\ndamping of robots and notifies the sampling time importance on the transparency\nand stability of the system. Both simulation and experimental results are\nperformed to show the validity of the proposed conditions and verify the\neffectiveness of the sampling scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 09:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

The model has shown that the reopening plans and governmental\nmeasures directly affect the number of active cases of the disease. Also, it\nhas specified that even releasing a small portion of the population (about 2-3\npercent) can lead to a severe increase in active patients and consequently\nmultiple waves in the disease progress. The effects of the healthcare\ncapacities of the country have been obtained (quantitatively), which clearly\nspecify the importance of this context.
