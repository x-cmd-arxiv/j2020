Combined with three-dimensional point\ncloud data processing and assembly position matching algorithm, the\nhigh-precision measurement of shaft hole assembly posture in the process of\nturbine shaft docking is realized. Firstly, the screw thread curve on the bolt\nsurface is segmented based on PCA projection and edge point cloud clustering,\nand Hough transform is used to model fit the three-dimensional thread curve.\nThen the preprocessed two-dimensional convex hull is constructed to segment the\nkey hole location features, and the mounting surface and hole location obtained\nby segmentation are fitted based on RANSAC method. Finally, the geometric\nfeature matching is used the evaluation index of turbine shaft assembly is\nestablished to optimize the pose. The final measurement accuracy of mounting\nsurface matching is less than 0.05mm, and the measurement accuracy of mounting\nhole matching based on minimum ance optimization is less than 0.1 degree. The\nmeasurement algorithm is implemented on the automatic assembly test-bed of a\ncertain type of aero-engine low-pressure turbine rotor. In the narrow\ninstallation space, the assembly process of the turbine shaft assembly, such as\nthe automatic alignment and docking of the shaft hole, the automatic heating\nand temperature measurement of the installation seam, and the automatic\ntightening of the two guns, are realized in the narrow installation space\nGuidance, real-time inspection and assembly result evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 17:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

Often, however, clinical questions also arise\nregarding the treatment effect in subpopulations of patients, which would\nexperience clinical or disease related events post-randomization. Events that\noccur after treatment initiation and potentially affect the interpretation or\nthe existence of the measurements are called {\\it intercurrent events} in the\nICH E9(R1) guideline. If the intercurrent event is a consequence of treatment,\nrandomization alone is no longer sufficient to meaningfully estimate the\ntreatment effect. Analyses comparing the subgroups of patients without the\nintercurrent events for intervention and control will not estimate a causal\neffect. This is well known, but post-hoc analyses of this kind are commonly\nperformed in drug development. An alternative approach is the principal stratum\nstrategy, which classifies subjects according to their potential occurrence of\nan intercurrent event on both study arms. We illustrate with examples that\nquestions formulated through principal strata occur naturally in drug\ndevelopment and argue that approaching these questions with the ICH E9(R1)\nestimand framework has the potential to lead to more transparent assumptions as\nwell as more adequate analyses and conclusions. In addition, we provide an\noverview of assumptions required for estimation of effects in principal strata.\nMost of these assumptions are unverifiable and should hence be based on solid\nscientific understanding.

Such\nlocking effects arise for colloids and superconducting vortices moving over\nordered substrates when the direction of the external drive is varied. Here we\nstudy the directional locking of run-and-tumble active matter particles\ninteracting with a periodic array of obstacles. In the absence of an external\nbiasing force, we find that the active particle motion locks to various\nsymmetry directions of the substrate when the run time between tumbles is\nlarge. The number of possible locking directions depends on the array density\nand on the relative sizes of the particles and the obstacles. For a square\narray of large obstacles, the active particle only locks to the $x$, $y$, and\n$45^{\\circ}$ directions, while for smaller obstacles, the number of locking\nangles increases. Each locking angle satisfies $\\theta = \\arctan(p/q)$, where\n$p$ and $q$ are integers, and the angle of motion can be measured using the\nratio of the velocities or the velocity distributions in the $x$ and $y$\ndirections. When a biasing driving force is applied, the directional locking\nbehavior is affected by the ratio of the self-propulsion force to the biasing\nforce. For large biasing, the behavior resembles that found for directional\nlocking in passive systems. For large obstacles under biased driving, a\ntrapping behavior occurs that is non-monotonic as a function of increasing run\nlength or increasing self-propulsion force, and the trapping diminishes when\nthe run length is sufficiently large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 16:45:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

With masses in the super-Earth\nrange ($1-10$ M$_{\\oplus}$) and radii akin to those of giant planets ($>4$\nR$_{\\oplus}$), their large envelopes may have been accreted beyond the water\nsnow line and many appear to be susceptible to catastrophic mass loss. Both the\npresence of water and the importance of mass loss can be explored using\ntransmission spectroscopy. Here, we present new HST WFC3 spectroscopy and\nupdated Kepler transit depth measurements for the super-puff Kepler-79d. We do\nnot detect any molecular absorption features in the $1.1-1.7$ $\\mu$m WFC3\nbandpass and the combination of Kepler and WFC3 data are consistent with a flat\nline model, indicating the presence of aerosols in the atmosphere. We compare\nthe shape of Kepler-79d's transmission spectrum to predictions from a\nmicrophysical haze model that incorporates an outward particle flux due to\nongoing mass loss. We find that photochemical hazes offer an attractive\nexplanation for the observed properties of super-puffs like Kepler-79d, as they\nsimultaneously render the near-infrared spectrum featureless and reduce the\ninferred envelope mass loss rate by moving the measured radius (optical depth\nunity surface during transit) to lower pressures. We revisit the broader\nquestion of mass loss rates for super-puffs and find that the age estimates and\nmass loss rates for the majority of super-puffs can be reconciled if hazes move\nthe photosphere from the typically assumed pressure of $\\sim 10$ mbar to $\\sim\n10 \\; \\mu$bar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 13:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-16"}

In a description that includes\nonly spatial variation of Fermi velocity, we derive the\nincident-angle-dependent localization length for the case of\nquasi-one-dimensional disorder by mapping this problem onto one dimensional\nAnderson localization. The localization length diverges at normal incidence as\na consequence of Klein tunneling, leading to a power-law decay of the\ntransmission when averaged over incidence angle. In a minimal model of TBG, the\nmodulation of twist angle also shifts the location of the Dirac cones in\nmomentum space in a way that can be described by a random gauge field, and thus\nKlein tunneling is inexact. However, when the Dirac electron's incident\nmomentum is large compared to these shifts, the primary effect of twist\ndisorder is only to shift the incident angle associated with perfect\ntransmission away from zero. These results suggest a mechanism for\ndisorder-induced collimation, valley filtration, and energy filtration of Dirac\nelectron beams, so that TBG offers a promising new platform for Dirac fermion\noptics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

We study the spatial and\nspectral co-evolution of SDFs, SSUBs, and umbral flashes in Ca II 8542 spectral\nprofiles. We produce models that generate the spectral profiles for all classes\nof features using non-LTE radiative transfer with a recent version of the\nNICOLE inversion code.

Therefore,\nwhatever mergers occur are driven by other mechanisms, which we find to be\ncaptures induced by dynamical friction and compressive tides from other GCs.\nThe low merger rate inferred here makes it unlikely that the unusually large\nluminosities of the GCs can be explained as a result of past GC-GC mergers.

The\nintegration of nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique with MEC has been\nshown to provide applications with lower latency and higher energy efficiency.\nHowever, existing designs of this type have mainly focused on the transmission\ntechnique, which is still insufficient.

We run global planet formation simulations including\nthe evolution of dust by coagulation, drift and fragmentation; and the\nevolution of the gaseous disc by viscous accretion and photoevaporation.

For higher\ndimensional systems, we discuss some additional conditions under which an\noccupied subspace is spanned by a compactly supported orthogonal basis, and\nshow that the corresponding projectors are topologically trivial in many cases.\nWe also show that a projector in arbitrary dimensions is strictly local if and\nonly if for any chosen axis, its image is spanned by hybrid Wannier functions\nthat are compactly supported along that axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 18:59:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 19:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

The aim is not to\nprovide a comprehensive list of references as that number would be in the\nthousands, but to review the major results and contributions which have\nanimated these areas and to provide a unified framework from which to\nunderstand the developments in different fields. Towards these goals, we chart\nthe early history of the field through its dual beginnings in the analysis of\nthe Sellmeier equation and in Hilbert transforms, giving rise to the far\nreaching dispersion relations in the early works of Kramers, Kronig, and\nTitchmarsh. However, these early relations constitute a limited result as they\nonly apply to a restricted class of transfer functions. To understand how this\nrestriction can be lifted, we take a quick detour into the distributional\nanalysis of Schwartz. This approach expands the reach of the dispersion\nanalysis to distributional transfer functions and also to those functions which\nexhibit polynomial growth properties. To generalize the results even further to\ntensorial transfer functions, we consider the concept of passivity - originally\nstudied in the theory of electrical networks.

Recent works have shown that giant planet growth and\nmigration can shape the asteroid belt, but these works have not considered\ninteractions between planetesimals. We have calculated the evolution of\nplanetesimal disks, including planetesimal-planetesimal collisions, during gas\ngiant growth and migration. The numbers, locations, and impact velocities of\nthese collisions depend on the specific growth and migration path. We find that\ngiant planet growth alone has little effect on impact velocities, and most of\nthe planetesimals scattered by growing giants do not undergo collisions with\neach other during the growth period. In contrast, we find that giant planet\nmigration induces large numbers of high velocity collisions between\nplanetesimals. These impacts have sufficient velocities to cause shock-induced\nvaporization for both water ice and silicate components of planetesimals, and\nto cause catastrophic disruption of the bodies. New bodies may form from impact\ndebris. Collisional evolution reduces the efficiency of planetesimal\nimplantation into the asteroid belt via giant planet growth and migration. A\nsmall fraction of the largest planetesimals implanted into the asteroid belt\nwould have been processed via collisions. We identify important consequences of\nplanetesimal collisions that have not been considered in planet accretion\nmodels. The prevalence of high velocity collisions during giant planet\nmigration, and their potential links to the properties of meteorites, and the\nformation of chondrules, makes impact vaporization a critically important\nphenomenon. The consequences of vaporizing planetesimal constituents require\nfurther detailed study. New collision outcome models for impacts within the\nnebula, and models for new planetesimal formation are needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 19:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-14"}

Special interest has\nbeen given to the range of initial masses of their progenitors, but despite the\nefforts made, it is still uncertain. Direct imaging of progenitors in\npre-explosion images point out an upper initial mass cutoff of\n$\\sim$18$M_{\\odot}$. However, this is in tension with previous studies in which\nprogenitor masses inferred by light curve modelling tend to favour high-mass\nsolutions. Moreover, it has been argued that light curve modelling alone cannot\nprovide a unique solution for the progenitor and explosion properties of SNe\nII. We develop a robust method which helps us to constrain the physical\nparameters of SNe II by fitting simultaneously their bolometric light curve and\nthe evolution of the photospheric velocity to hydrodynamical models using\nstatistical inference techniques. Pre-supernova red supergiant models were\ncreated using the stellar evolution code MESA, varying the initial progenitor\nmass. The explosion of these progenitors was then processed through\nhydrodynamical simulations, where the explosion energy, synthesised nickel\nmass, and the latter's spatial distribution within the ejecta were changed. We\ncompare to observations via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We apply this\nmethod to a well-studied set of SNe with an observed progenitor in\npre-explosion images and compare with results in the literature. Progenitor\nmass constraints are found to be consistent between our results and those\nderived by pre-SN imaging and the analysis of late-time spectral modelling. We\nhave developed a robust method to infer progenitor and explosion properties of\nSN II progenitors which is consistent with other methods in the literature,\nwhich suggests that hydrodynamical modelling is able to accurately constrain\nphysical properties of SNe II.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 21:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

This result\nprovides solid evidence that the forward shock of RX J1713.7$-$3946 is indeed\ncolliding with dense gas discovered through radio observations reported in the\nliterature. The locations and velocity differences of the two blobs lead to an\nestimate that the shock encountered with the dense gas $\\sim 100~\\mathrm{yr}$\nago. The shock velocities, together with cutoff energies of the synchrotron\nX-ray spectra of the blobs, indicate that particle acceleration in these\nregions is close to the Bohm limit. Blob B, in particular, is almost at the\nlimit, accelerating particles at the fastest possible rate.

The optical spectrum is typical of a 03fg-like SN Ia, but the light\ncurves are unlike those of any SNe Ia observed. The light curves of LSQ14fmg\nrise extremely slowly. At -23 rest-frame days relative to B-band maximum,\nLSQ14fmg is already brighter than $M_V$=-19 mag before host extinction\ncorrection. The observed color curves show a flat evolution from the earliest\nobservation to approximately one week after maximum. The near-infrared light\ncurves peak brighter than -20.5 mag in the J and H bands, far more luminous\nthan any 03fg-like SNe Ia with near-infrared observations. At one month past\nmaximum, the optical light curves decline rapidly. The early, slow rise and\nflat color evolution are interpreted to result from an additional excess flux\nfrom a power source other than the radioactive decay of the synthesized\n$^{56}Ni$. The excess flux matches the interaction with a typical superwind of\nan asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star in density structure, mass-loss rate, and\nduration. The rapid decline starting at around one month past B-band maximum\nmay be an indication of rapid cooling by active carbon monoxide (CO) formation,\nwhich requires a low temperature and high density environment. These\npeculiarities point to an AGB progenitor near the end of its evolution and the\ncore degenerate scenario as the likely explosion mechanism for LSQ14fmg.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 00:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-14"}

Here we propose a non-Markovian Majority-Vote model (NMMV)\nthat introduces non-Markovian effects in the standard (Markovian) Majority-Vote\nmodel (SMV). The SMV model is one of the simplest two-state stochastic models\nfor studying opinion dynamics, and displays a continuous order-disorder phase\ntransition at a critical noise. In the NMMV model we assume that the\nprobability that an agent changes state is not only dependent on the majority\nstate of his neighbors but it also depends on his {\\em age}, i.e. how long the\nagent has been in his current state. The NMMV model has two regimes: the aging\nregime implies that the probability that an agent changes state is decreasing\nwith his age, while in the anti-aging regime the probability that an agent\nchanges state is increasing with his age. Interestingly, we find that the\ncritical noise at which we observe the order-disorder phase transition is a\nnon-monotonic function of the rate $\\beta$ of the aging (anti-aging) process.\nIn particular the critical noise in the aging regime displays a maximum as a\nfunction of $\\beta$ while in the anti-aging regime displays a minimum. This\nimplies that the aging/anti-aging dynamics can retard/anticipate the transition\nand that there is an optimal rate $\\beta$ for maximally perturbing the value of\nthe critical noise.

Despite the traditional representation\nencoder and response generation modules, an additional ranking module is\nintroduced to model the ranking relation between the former utterance and\nconsecutive utterances.

For this aim, a simple and efficient\none-dimensional (1D) lattice gas automaton (LGA) is presented for wealth\ndistribution of agents with or without saving propensity. The LGA comprises two\nstages, i.e., random propagation and economic transaction. During the former\nphase, an agent either remains motionless or travels to one of its neighboring\nempty sites with a certain probability. In the subsequent procedure, an\neconomic transaction takes place between a pair of neighboring agents randomly.\nIt requires at least 4 neighbors to present correct simulation results. The LGA\nreduces to the simplest model with only random economic transaction if all\nagents are neighbors and no empty sites exist. The 1D-LGA has a higher\ncomputational efficiency than the 2D-LGA and the famous Chakraborti-Chakrabarti\neconomic model. Finally, the LGA is validated with two benchmarks, i.e., the\nwealth distributions of individual agents and dual-earner families. With the\nincreasing saving fraction, both the Gini coefficient and Kolkata index (for\nindividual agents or two-earner families) reduce, while the deviation degree\n(defined to measure the difference between the probability distributions with\nand without saving propensities) increases. It is demonstrated that the wealth\ndistribution is changed significantly by the saving propensity which alleviates\nwealth inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 03:22:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 13:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

In this paper, we exploit prior knowledge\nof the relations among object categories to cluster fine-grained classes into\ncoarser parent classes, and construct a classification tree that is responsible\nfor parsing an object instance into a fine-grained category via its parent\nclass. In the classification tree, as the number of parent class nodes are\nsignificantly less, their logits are less noisy and can be utilized to suppress\nthe wrong/noisy logits existed in the fine-grained class nodes. As the way to\nconstruct the parent class is not unique, we further build multiple trees to\nform a classification forest where each tree contributes its vote to the\nfine-grained classification.

To address the localization\nchallenges of urban settings, we propose a novel feature voting technique for\nvisual localization. Different from the conventional front-view-based method,\nour approach employs views from three directions (front, left, and right) and\nthus significantly improves the robustness of location prediction. In our work,\nwe craft the proposed feature voting method into three state-of-the-art visual\nlocalization networks and modify their architectures properly so that they can\nbe applied for vehicular operation.

The\nmission includes two key elements: (1) an orbiter spacecraft, which also acts\nas a data relay, and (2) one or more small probes to directly investigate\nTitan's seas and make the first direct measurements of their liquid composition\nand physical environment. The orbiter would carry a sophisticated remote\nsensing payload, including a novel topographic lidar, a long-wavelength\nsurface-penetrating radar, a sub-millimeter sounder for winds and for\nmesospheric/thermospheric composition, and a camera and near-infrared\nspectrometer. An instrument suite to analyze particles and fields would include\na mass spectrometer to focus on the interactions between Titan's escaping upper\natmosphere and the solar wind and Saturnian magnetosphere.

The calculated values of bandgaps by using PBEsol and\n$G_0W_0$ methods are found to be in good agreement with the experiment, whereas\nmBJ underestimates the bandgap. The estimated value of fully screened Coulomb\ninteraction ($W$) for Sn (Te) 5$p$ orbitals is $\\sim$1.39 ($\\sim$1.70) eV. The\nnature of frequency dependent $W$ reveals that the correlation strength of this\ncompound is relatively weaker and hence the excited electronic state can be\nproperly studied by full-$GW$ many-body technique. The plasmon excitation is\nfound to be important in understanding this frequency dependent $W$. In order\nto describe the experimental phonon modes, the long range Coulomb forces using\nnonanalytical term correction is considered. The temperature dependent\nelectron-electron interactions (EEI) reduces the bandgaps with increasing\ntemperature. The value of bandgap at 300 K is obtained to be $\\sim$161 meV.

By training on the entire\ncamera rig, we provide evidence that our model is able to learn not only how to\nrepresent images but how to fuse predictions from all cameras into a single\ncohesive representation of the scene while being robust to calibration error.\nOn standard bird's-eye-view tasks such as object segmentation and map\nsegmentation, our model outperforms all baselines and prior work.

However, in real applications, a\npretrained pose estimation model usually need be adapted to a novel domain with\nno labels or sparse labels. Such domain adaptation for 2D pose estimation\nhasn't been explored. The main reason is that a pose, by nature, has typical\ntopological structure and needs fine-grained features in local keypoints. While\nexisting adaptation methods do not consider topological structure of\nobject-of-interest and they align the whole images coarsely. Therefore, we\npropose a novel domain adaptation method for multi-person pose estimation to\nconduct the human-level topological structure alignment and fine-grained\nfeature alignment. Our method consists of three modules: Cross-Attentive\nFeature Alignment (CAFA), Intra-domain Structure Adaptation (ISA) and\nInter-domain Human-Topology Alignment (IHTA) module. The CAFA adopts a\nbidirectional spatial attention module (BSAM)that focuses on fine-grained local\nfeature correlation between two humans to adaptively aggregate consistent\nfeatures for adaptation. We adopt ISA only in semi-supervised domain adaptation\n(SSDA) to exploit the corresponding keypoint semantic relationship for reducing\nthe intra-domain bias. Most importantly, we propose an IHTA to learn more\ndomain-invariant human topological representation for reducing the inter-domain\ndiscrepancy. We model the human topological structure via the graph convolution\nnetwork (GCN), by passing messages on which, high-order relations can be\nconsidered. This structure preserving alignment based on GCN is beneficial to\nthe occluded or extreme pose inference.

The\nproblem can be mitigated by using active learning (AL) techniques which, under\na given annotation budget, allow to select a subset of data that yields maximum\naccuracy upon fine tuning. State of the art AL approaches typically rely on\nmeasures of visual diversity or prediction uncertainty, which are unable to\neffectively capture the variations in spatial context. On the other hand,\nmodern CNN architectures make heavy use of spatial context for achieving highly\naccurate predictions. Since the context is difficult to evaluate in the absence\nof ground-truth labels, we introduce the notion of contextual diversity that\ncaptures the confusion associated with spatially co-occurring classes.\nContextual Diversity (CD) hinges on a crucial observation that the probability\nvector predicted by a CNN for a region of interest typically contains\ninformation from a larger receptive field.

Event cameras, also called Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVSs),\ngenerate highly asynchronous streams of events triggered upon illumination\nchanges for each individual pixel. This novel paradigm presents advantages in\nlow illumination conditions and high-speed motions. Nonetheless, this\nunconventional sensing modality brings new challenges to perform scene\nreconstruction or motion estimation. The proposed method offers to leverage a\ncontinuous-time representation of the inertial readings to associate each event\nwith timely accurate inertial data. The method's front-end extracts event\nclusters that belong to line segments in the environment whereas the back-end\nestimates the system's trajectory alongside the lines' 3D position by\nminimizing point-to-line distances between individual events and the lines'\nprojection in the image space. A novel attraction/repulsion mechanism is\npresented to accurately estimate the lines' extremities, avoiding their\nexplicit detection in the event data. The proposed method is benchmarked\nagainst a state-of-the-art frame-based visual-inertial odometry framework using\npublic datasets. The results show that IDOL performs at the same order of\nmagnitude on most datasets and even shows better orientation estimates.

We aim to compare observations from RESIK and RHESSI\nspectrometers and cross-correlate these instruments. Observations are compared\nwith synthetic spectra calculated based on the results of one-dimensional\nhydrodynamical (1D-HD) modelling. The analysis was performed for the flare on\n20 September 2002. We estimated the geometry of the flaring loop, necessary for\n1D-HD modelling, based on images from RHESSI and SOHO/EIT. The distribution of\nnon-thermal electrons (NTEs) was determined from RHESSI spectra. The 1D-HD\nmodel assumes that non-thermal electrons with a power-law spectrum were\ninjected at the apex of the flaring loop. The NTEs then heat and evaporate the\nchromosphere, filling the loop with hot and dense plasma radiating in soft\nX-rays. The total energy of electrons was constrained by comparing observed and\ncalculated fluxes from GOES 1 - 8 A data. We determined the temperature and\ndensity at every point of the flaring loop throughout the evolution of the\nflare, calculating the resulting X-ray spectra. The synthetic spectra\ncalculated based on the results of hydrodynamic modelling for the 20 September\n2002 flare are consistent within a factor of two with the observed RESIK\nspectra during most of the duration of the flare. This discrepancy factor is\nprobably related to the uncertainty on the cross-calibration between RESIK and\nRHESSI instruments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 08:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Since the\nunderlying data distribution is unknown a priori, a closed-form solution is\ngenerally not available, and classical deterministic optimization paradigms are\nnot applicable. State-of-the-art approaches, such as those using the saddle\npoint framework, can ensure that the optimality gap as well as the constraint\nviolation decay as $\\O\\left(T^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)$ where $T$ is the number of\nstochastic gradients.

When singlet-triplet energy gaps are comparable to thermal\nenergies (~tens of millielectronvolts), RISC is fast and limited only by\nbottlenecks due to spin-selection rules. We have studied this phenomenon under\ndevice operating conditions using pulsed electrically detected magnetic\nresonance spectroscopy (pEDMR) in OLEDs based on the donor:acceptor combination\nm MTDATA:BPhen (4,4',4''-tris[phenyl(m-tolyl)amino]triphenylamine : 4,7\ndiphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline).

They also connect\nmany sub-areas of mathematics like game theory, optimization, and matrix\ntheory. Despite their close relation to optimization, the protection of LCPs\nagainst uncertainties -- especially in the sense of robust optimization -- is\nstill in its infancy. During the last years, robust LCPs have only been studied\nusing the notions of strict and $\\Gamma$-robustness. Unfortunately, both\nconcepts lead to the problem that the existence of robust solutions cannot be\nguaranteed. In this paper, we consider affinely adjustable robust LCPs. In the\nlatter, a part of the LCP solution is allowed to adjust via a function that is\naffine in the uncertainty. We show that this notion of robustness allows to\nestablish strong characterizations of solutions for the cases of uncertain\nmatrix and vector, separately, from which existence results can be derived.\n  Our main results are valid for the case of an uncertain LCP vector. Here, we\nadditionally provide sufficient conditions on the LCP matrix for the uniqueness\nof a solution. Moreover, based on characterizations of the affinely adjustable\nrobust solutions, we derive a mixed-integer programming formulation that allows\nto solve the corresponding robust counterpart. If, in addition, the certain LCP\nmatrix is positive semidefinite, we prove polynomial-time solvability and\nuniqueness of robust solutions. If the LCP matrix is uncertain,\ncharacterizations of solutions are developed for every nominal matrix, i.e.,\nthese characterizations are, in particular, independent of the definiteness of\nthe nominal matrix. Robust solutions are also shown to be unique for positive\ndefinite LCP matrix but both uniqueness and mixed-integer programming\nformulations still remain open problems if the nominal LCP matrix is not psd.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 10:00:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 07:49:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 11:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

Since then, an\nimpressive amount of research has been dedicated to identifying classes of\ngraphs that allow Hamiltonian cycles, and to related questions. The\ncorresponding decision problem, that asks whether a given graph is Hamiltonian\n(i.\\,e.\\ admits a Hamiltonian cycle), is one of Karp's famous NP-complete\nproblems. In this paper we study graphs of bounded degree that are \\emph{far}\nfrom being Hamiltonian, where a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is \\emph{far} from\nbeing Hamiltonian, if modifying a constant fraction of $n$ edges is necessary\nto make $G$ Hamiltonian. We give an explicit deterministic construction of a\nclass of graphs of bounded degree that are locally Hamiltonian, but (globally)\nfar from being Hamiltonian. Here, \\emph{locally Hamiltonian} means that every\nsubgraph induced by the neighbourhood of a small vertex set appears in some\nHamiltonian graph. More precisely, we obtain graphs which differ in $\\Theta(n)$\nedges from any Hamiltonian graph, but non-Hamiltonicity cannot be detected in\nthe neighbourhood of $o(n)$ vertices. Our class of graphs yields a class of\nhard instances for one-sided error property testers with linear query\ncomplexity. It is known that any property tester (even with two-sided error)\nrequires a linear number of queries to test Hamiltonicity (Yoshida, Ito, 2010).\nThis is proved via a randomised construction of hard instances. In contrast,\nour construction is deterministic. So far only very few deterministic\nconstructions of hard instances for property testing are known.

Past studies have investigated style\nconversion in TTS synthesis, yet degraded synthesized quality often leads to\nworse intelligibility. To overcome such limitations, we proposed a novel\ntransfer learning approach using Tacotron and WaveRNN based TTS synthesis. The\nproposed speech system exploits two modification strategies: (a) Lombard\nspeaking style data and (b) Spectral Shaping and Dynamic Range Compression\n(SSDRC) which has been shown to provide high intelligibility gains by\nredistributing the signal energy on the time-frequency domain. We refer to this\nextension as Lombard-SSDRC TTS system. Intelligibility enhancement as\nquantified by the Intelligibility in Bits (SIIB-Gauss) measure shows that the\nproposed Lombard-SSDRC TTS system shows significant relative improvement\nbetween 110% and 130% in speech-shaped noise (SSN), and 47% to 140% in\ncompeting-speaker noise (CSN) against the state-of-the-art TTS approach.\nAdditional subjective evaluation shows that Lombard-SSDRC TTS successfully\nincreases the speech intelligibility with relative improvement of 455% for SSN\nand 104% for CSN in median keyword correction rate compared to the baseline TTS\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 10:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-14"}

The network contains: (\\textit{i}) a mutual enhancement module\nto simultaneously complement the representation of the few trimmed support\nvideos and the untrimmed query video; (\\textit{ii}) a progressive alignment\nmodule that iteratively fuses the support videos into the query branch; and\n(\\textit{iii}) a pairwise matching module to weigh the importance of different\nsupport videos. Evaluation of few-shot common action localization in untrimmed\nvideos containing a single or multiple action instances demonstrates the\neffectiveness and general applicability of our proposal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 11:31:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 12:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Echelle spectrographs are typical instruments in\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy, but attempts to improve the wavelength coverage\nand versatility of these instruments results in a complicated and variable\nfootprint of the entrance slit projection onto the science detector.\nTraditional spectral extraction methods fail to perform a truly optimal\nextraction, when the slit image is not aligned with the detector columns but\ninstead is tilted or even curved.\n  We here present the mathematical algorithms and examples of their application\nto the optimal extraction and the following reduction steps for echelle\nspectrometers equipped with an entrance slit, that is imaged with various\ndistortions, such as variable tilt and curvature. The new method minimizes the\nloss of spectral resolution, maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio, and\nefficiently identifies local outliers.

Recent studies have\nshown that these heads exhibit syntactic, semantic, or local behaviour. Some\nstudies have also identified promise in restricting this attention to be local,\ni.e., a token attending to other tokens only in a small neighbourhood around\nit. However, no conclusive evidence exists that such local attention alone is\nsufficient to achieve high accuracy on multiple NLP tasks. In this work, we\nsystematically analyse the role of locality information in learnt models and\ncontrast it with the role of syntactic information. More specifically, we first\ndo a sensitivity analysis and show that, at every layer, the representation of\na token is much more sensitive to tokens in a small neighborhood around it than\nto tokens which are syntactically related to it. We then define an attention\nbias metric to determine whether a head pays more attention to local tokens or\nto syntactically related tokens. We show that a larger fraction of heads have a\nlocality bias as compared to a syntactic bias. Having established the\nimportance of local attention heads, we train and evaluate models where varying\nfractions of the attention heads are constrained to be local. Such models would\nbe more efficient as they would have fewer computations in the attention layer.\nWe evaluate these models on 4 GLUE datasets (QQP, SST-2, MRPC, QNLI) and 2 MT\ndatasets (En-De, En-Ru) and clearly demonstrate that such constrained models\nhave comparable performance to the unconstrained models. Through this\nsystematic evaluation we establish that attention in Transformer-based models\ncan be constrained to be local without affecting performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 11:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-14"}

Therefore, there may exist GDPR compliance violations in existing\napps, which would pose severe privacy threats to app users. In this paper, we\ntake mobile health applications (mHealth apps) as a peephole to examine the\nstatus quo of GDPR compliance in Android apps. We first propose an automated\nsystem, named \\mytool, to bridge the semantic gap between the general rules of\nGDPR and the app implementations by identifying the data practices declared in\nthe app privacy policy and the data relevant behaviors in the app code. Then,\nbased on \\mytool, we detect three kinds of GDPR compliance violations,\nincluding the incompleteness of privacy policy, the inconsistency of data\ncollections, and the insecurity of data transmission. We perform an empirical\nevaluation of 796 mHealth apps. The results reveal that 189 (23.7\\%) of them do\nnot provide complete privacy policies. Moreover, 59 apps collect sensitive data\nthrough different measures, but 46 (77.9\\%) of them contain at least one\ninconsistent collection behavior. Even worse, among the 59 apps, only 8 apps\ntry to ensure the transmission security of collected data. However, all of them\ncontain at least one encryption or SSL misuse. Our work exposes severe privacy\nissues to raise awareness of privacy protection for app users and developers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 12:50:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 09:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

First, we present a new large-scale 'in-the-wild' dynamic facial\nexpression database, DFEW (Dynamic Facial Expression in the Wild), consisting\nof over 16,000 video clips from thousands of movies. These video clips contain\nvarious challenging interferences in practical scenarios such as extreme\nillumination, occlusions, and capricious pose changes. Second, we propose a\nnovel method called Expression-Clustered Spatiotemporal Feature Learning\n(EC-STFL) framework to deal with dynamic FER in the wild. Third, we conduct\nextensive benchmark experiments on DFEW using a lot of spatiotemporal deep\nfeature learning methods as well as our proposed EC-STFL. Experimental results\nshow that DFEW is a well-designed and challenging database, and the proposed\nEC-STFL can promisingly improve the performance of existing spatiotemporal deep\nneural networks in coping with the problem of dynamic FER in the wild.

Depending on whether we start with Type II or\n11-dimensional supergravity, we obtain double and exceptional field theory\nrespectively which we collectively refer to as ExFTs. At the cost of being\nforced into a generalised notion of diffeomorphisms that fail to close onto an\nalgebra, ExFTs embody a powerful paradigm built on the idea of unification-of\nsymmetries, of fields and of solutions.\n  However, ExFTs are much more than just a rewriting of supergravities.

A team\nfrom MIT Media Lab was able to locate them all within 9 hours using social\nmedia and a novel reward scheme that rewarded viral recruitment. This\nachievement was rightly seen as proof of the remarkable ability of social\nmedia, then relatively nascent, to solve real world problems such as\nlarge-scale spatial search. Upon reflection, however, the challenge was also\nremarkable as it succeeded despite many efforts to provide false information on\nthe location of the balloons.

However, the\npicture from gas observations is much less clear and constraints on the radial\ngas density structure (i.e. gas gaps) remain rare and uncertain. We want to\ninvestigate the importance of thermo-chemical processes for the interpretation\nof high-spatial-resolution gas observations of planet-forming disks and their\nimpact on derived gas properties. We apply the radiation thermo-chemical disk\ncode ProDiMo (PROtoplanetary DIsk MOdel) to model self-consistently the dust\nand gas disk of HD 163296, using the DSHARP gas and dust observations. With\nthis model we investigate the impact of dust gaps and gas gaps, considering\nchemistry and heating/cooling processes, on the observables and the derived gas\nproperties. We find distinct peaks in the radial line intensity profiles of the\nCO line data of HD 163296 at the location of the dust gaps. Our model indicates\nthat those peaks are not only a consequence of a gas temperature increase\nwithin the gaps but are mainly caused by the absorption of line emission from\nthe back side of the disk by the dust rings. For two of the three prominent\ndust gaps in HD 163296, we find that thermo-chemical effects are negligible for\nderiving density gradients via measurements of the rotation velocity. However,\nfor the gap with the highest dust depletion, the temperature gradient can be\ndominant and needs to be considered to derive accurate gas density profiles.\nSelf-consistent gas and dust thermo-chemical modelling in combination with\nhigh-quality observations of multiple molecules are necessary to accurately\nderive gas gap depths and shapes. This is crucial to determine the origin of\ngaps and rings in planet-forming disks and to improve the mass estimates of\nforming planets if they are the cause of the gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 14:50:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 14:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have been performed to\nquestion the nature of the topological barriers at play, leading to several\npredictions on possible molecular actors. Here, we address the question of\ntopological barriers using polymer models of supercoiled DNA chains. More\nspecifically, we determine under which conditions DNA-bridging proteins may act\nas topological barriers. To this end, we developed a coarse-grained\nbead-and-spring model and investigated its properties through Brownian dynamics\nsimulations. As a result, we find that DNA-bridging proteins must exert rather\nstrong constraints on their binding sites: they must block the diffusion of the\nexcess of twist through the two binding sites on the DNA molecule and,\nsimultaneously, prevent the rotation of one DNA segment relative to the other\none. Importantly, not all DNA-bridging proteins satisfy this second condition.\nFor example, single bridges formed by proteins that bind DNA non-specifically,\nlike H-NS dimers, are expected to fail with this respect. Our findings might\nalso explain, in the case of specific DNA-bridging proteins like LacI, why\nmultiple bridges are required to create stable independent topological domains.\nStrikingly, when the relative rotation of the DNA segments is not prevented,\nrelaxation results in complex intrication of the two domains.

Two key factors that hinder\nthe practical applicability of learning methods in control are their high\ncomputational complexity and limited generalization capabilities to unseen\nconditions. Meta-learning is a powerful tool that enables efficient learning\nacross a finite set of related tasks, easing adaptation to new unseen tasks.\nThis paper makes use of a meta-learning approach for adaptive model predictive\ncontrol, by learning a system model that leverages data from previous related\ntasks, while enabling fast fine-tuning to the current task during closed-loop\noperation. The dynamics is modeled via Gaussian process regression and,\nbuilding on the Karhunen-Lo{\\`e}ve expansion, can be approximately reformulated\nas a finite linear combination of kernel eigenfunctions. Using data collected\nover a set of tasks, the eigenfunction hyperparameters are optimized in a\nmeta-training phase by maximizing a variational bound for the log-marginal\nlikelihood. During meta-testing, the eigenfunctions are fixed, so that only the\nlinear parameters are adapted to the new unseen task in an online adaptive\nfashion via Bayesian linear regression, providing a simple and efficient\ninference scheme.

In the receiver, the respective\ndemodulation/despreading restores the information-carrying narrowband signal.\nIn this paper, we introduce an alternative approach, where the low-rate\ninformation is encoded directly into a wideband waveform of a given bandwidth,\nwithout physical \"spreading\" of the carrier's frequency. The main advantages of\nthis approach lie in extended options for encoding the information, and in\nretaining a reversible control over the temporal and amplitude structures of\nthe modulating wideband waveforms. Significant \"excess bandwidth\" (over that\nneeded to carry the information) enables us to use allpass filters to manage\nstatistical properties and time-domain appearances of these waveforms without\nchanging their spectral composition. For example, a mixture of transmitted\nwaveforms can be shaped as a low-crest-factor signal (e.g. to reduce the burden\non the power amplifier), and/or made statistically indistinguishable from\nGaussian noise (e.g. for covert transmissions and physical layer\nsteganography), while the selected components of the received waveform can be\ntransformed into high-crest-factor pulse trains suitable for multiplexing\nand/or low-SNR communications. Further, control over the temporal and amplitude\nstructures of wideband waveforms carrying low-rate information enables\neffective use of nonlinear filtering techniques. Such techniques can be\nemployed for robust real-time asynchronous extraction of the information, as\nwell as for separation of wideband signal components with identical spectral\ncontent from each other. This can facilitate development of a large variety of\nlow-SNR and covert communication configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 15:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

Given the challenges related\nto subjective variations of facial expressions, and operational capture\nconditions, the accuracy of state-of-the-art DL models for recognizing facial\nexpressions may decline. Domain adaptation has been widely explored to\nalleviate the problem of domain shifts that typically occur between video data\ncaptured across various source and target domains. Moreover, given the\nlaborious task of collecting and annotating videos, and subjective bias due to\nambiguity among adjacent intensity levels, weakly-supervised learning is\ngaining attention in such applications. State-of-the-art WSL models are\ntypically formulated as regression problems, and do not leverage the ordinal\nrelationship among pain intensity levels, nor temporal coherence of multiple\nconsecutive frames. This paper introduces a new DL model for weakly-supervised\nDA with ordinal regression that can be adapted using target domain videos with\ncoarse labels provided on a periodic basis. The WSDA-OR model enforces ordinal\nrelationships among intensity levels assigned to target sequences, and\nassociates multiple relevant frames to sequence-level labels. In particular, it\nlearns discriminant and domain-invariant feature representations by integrating\nmultiple instance learning with deep adversarial DA, where soft Gaussian labels\nare used to efficiently represent the weak ordinal sequence-level labels from\ntarget domain. The proposed approach was validated using RECOLA video dataset\nas fully-labeled source domain data, and UNBC-McMaster shoulder pain video\ndataset as weakly-labeled target domain data. We have also validated WSDA-OR on\nBIOVID and Fatigue datasets for sequence level estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 15:42:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 02:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

To obtain the phonetic information, we usually prepare a\nphoneme-based acoustic model, which is trained using speech waveforms and\nphoneme labels.

The combination from both is\ngiven to a discriminator which tells whether the generated image is correct or\nnot. We evaluate our network on 3 different datasets: MNIST, LSUN and CelebA\ndataset. Our network beats the previous state of the art using MMD, SSIM, log\nlikelihood, reconstruction error, ELBO and KL divergence as the evaluation\nmetrics while generating much sharper images.

While the neural transformers\nconsistently deliver the best performance among the state-of-the-art neural\narchitectures in field of natural language processing (NLP), their merits in a\nclosely related field, i.e., spoken language understanding (SLU) have not beed\ninvestigated. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end neural\ntransformer-based SLU model that can predict the variable-length domain,\nintent, and slots vectors embedded in an audio signal with no intermediate\ntoken prediction architecture. This new architecture leverages the\nself-attention mechanism by which the audio signal is transformed to various\nsub-subspaces allowing to extract the semantic context implied by an utterance.\nOur end-to-end transformer SLU predicts the domains, intents and slots in the\nFluent Speech Commands dataset with accuracy equal to 98.1 \\%, 99.6 \\%, and\n99.6 \\%, respectively and outperforms the SLU models that leverage a\ncombination of recurrent and convolutional neural networks by 1.4 \\% while the\nsize of our model is 25\\% smaller than that of these architectures.\nAdditionally, due to independent sub-space projections in the self-attention\nlayer, the model is highly parallelizable which makes it a good candidate for\non-device SLU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 22:58:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Here\nit is argued that inside small isolated quantum systems, time does not pass as\nwe are used to, and it is primarily in this sense that quantum objects enjoy\nonly limited reality.

Their preparation as well as their measurement-phases\nleave durable records and traces in the entropy of the environment. The\nLandauer Principle then gives a quantitative threshold for irreversibility.\nWith double slit experiments and tunneling as paradigmatic examples, it is\nproposed that a label of timelessness offers clues for rendering a Copenhagen\ntype interpretation of quantum physics more realistic and acceptable by\nproviding a coarse but viable link from the fundamental quantum realm to the\nclassical world which humans directly experience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 09:38:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 12:18:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}
