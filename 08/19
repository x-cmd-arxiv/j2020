In our field experiments, a\npre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) is deployed at the UAV to\nidentify a target (a vehicle) from the captured video frames and enable the UAV\nto keep tracking. However, this kind of visual target tracking demands a lot of\ncomputational resources due to the desired high inference accuracy and\nstringent delay requirement. This motivates us to consider offloading this type\nof deep learning (DL) tasks to a mobile edge computing (MEC) server due to\nlimited computational resource and energy budget of the UAV, and further\nimprove the inference accuracy. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical\nDL tasks distribution framework, where the UAV is embedded with lower layers of\nthe pre-trained CNN model, while the MEC server with rich computing resources\nwill handle the higher layers of the CNN model. An optimization problem is\nformulated to minimize the weighted-sum cost including the tracking delay and\nenergy consumption introduced by communication and computing of the UAVs, while\ntaking into account the quality of data (e.g., video frames) input to the DL\nmodel and the inference errors. Analytical results are obtained and insights\nare provided to understand the tradeoff between the weighted-sum cost and\ninference error rate in the proposed framework. Numerical results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed offloading framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 16:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

A crucial element in this phenomenology is vortex pinning by material\ndefects, e.g., immobilizing vortices at small drives and thereby guaranteeing\ndissipation-free current flow. Pinning models for vortices and other\ntopological defects, such as domain walls in magnets or dislocations in\ncrystals, come in two standard variants: i) weak collective pinning, where\nindividual weak defects are unable to pin, while the random accumulation of\nmany force centers within a collective pinning volume combines into an\neffective pin, and ii) strong pinning, where strong defects produce large\nvortex displacements and bistabilities that lead to pinning on the level of\nindividual defects. The transition between strong and weak pinning is\nquantified by the Labusch criterion $\\kappa \\approx f_p/\\bar{C}\\xi = 1$, where\n$f_p$ and $\\bar{C}$ are the force of one defect and the effective elasticity of\nthe vortex lattice, respectively ($\\xi$ is the coherence length). Here, we show\nthat a third generic type of pinning becomes dominant when the pinning force\n$f_p$ enters the weak regime, the pinning by rare events. We find that within\nan intermediate regime $1/2 < \\kappa < 1$, compact pairs of weak defects define\nstrong pinning clusters that extend the mechanism of strong pinning into the\nweak regime. We present a detailed analysis of this cluster-pinning mechanism\nand show that its pinning-force density parametrically dominates over the weak\npinning result. The present work is a first attempt to include correlations\nbetween defects into the discussion of strong pinning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 16:27:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

The line strength of the Ca II triplet (CaT) lines are a\nproxy to measure metallicity from individual stellar spectra of bright red\ngiant stars. It is a mandatory step to remove the magnitude (proxy for gravity,\ntemperature and luminosity) dependence from the equivalent width (EW) of the\nlines before converting them into metallicities. The working empirical\nprocedure used for decades is to use the relative magnitude with respect to the\nhorizontal branch level. Aims. The V filter is broadly adopted as the reference\nmagnitude, although a few works have used different filters (I and Ks, for\nexample). In this work we investigate the dependence of the CaT calibration\nusing griz filters from the DECam and the GMOS, G from Gaia, BVI filters from\nthe MCPS, YJKs filters from VIRCAM.

If the same line profile function is used with the same\nbandpasses and continuum regions, and the total EW comes from the same number\nof lines (2 or 3), then the reduced EW is the same regardless the filter used.\nTherefore, any filter can be used to convert the CaT equivalent widths into\nmetallicity for a given CaT calibration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 17:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

This phenomenon is particularly\nimportant in reservoirs with abundant fractures and faults because the induced\nslip and opening of the fractures may significantly alter their hydraulic\nproperties. Modeling strongly coupled poro-mechanical processes in naturally\nfractured reservoirs is a challenging problem. The Discrete Fracture Model\n(DFM) is a state-of-art method for modeling coupled flow and mechanics in\nfractured reservoirs. This method requires constructing computational grids\nthat comform to fractures, which is very challenging in complex 3D settings.\nThe objective of this study is to develop a numerical method that does not\nrequire gridding near fractures and can efficiently model hydromechanical\ninteractions in fractured reservoirs. We utilize formulations based on the\nStrong Discontinuity Approach (SDA) for mechanics and Embedded Discrete\nFracture Model (EDFM) for flow.

We then introduce\na series of mechanical tests that investigate the spatial convergence of the\nmodel and compare its accuracy with the Discrete Fracture Model (DFM). We\nfinally consider a synthetic coupled case of a reservoir with several fractures\nand compare the performance of the SDA and DFM methods.

NGC\n2770 was dubbed a SN factory, because it hosted four core-collapse SNe in 20\nyears (three type Ib and one type IIn). Its star formation rate (SFR) was\nreported not to be enhanced and therefore not compatible with such a high SN\nrate. We aim at explaining the high SN rate of NGC 2770. We used archival HI\nline data for NGC 2770 and reinterpret the Halpha and optical continuum data.\nEven though the continuum-based SFR indicators do not yield high values, the\ndust-corrected Halpha luminosity implies a high SFR, consistent with the high\nSN rate. Such disparity between the SFR estimators is an indication of recently\nenhanced star formation activity, because the continuum indicators trace long\ntimescale of the order of 100 Myr, unlike the line indicators, which trace\ntimescales of the order of 10 Myr. Hence, the unique feature of NGC 2770\ncompared to other galaxies is the fact that it is observed very recently after\nthe enhancement of the SFR. It also has high dust extinction, E(B-V) above 1\nmag. We provide support for the hypothesis that the increased SFR in NGC 2770\nis due to the interaction with its companion galaxies. We report an HI bridge\nbetween NGC 2770 and its closest companion and the existence of a total of four\ncompanions within 100 kpc (one identified for the first time).

In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the use of a critically-coupled 16m optical cavity to diminish\nanti-squeezing at frequencies below 90Hz where it exacerbates QRPN, while\npreserving beneficial squeezing at higher frequencies. This is called an\namplitude filter cavity, and it is useful for avoiding degradation of detector\nsensitivity at low frequencies. The attenuation from the cavity also provides\ntechnical advantages such as mitigating backscatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 01:10:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-16"}

Their observed orbital properties do not correspond to\nmodel predictions: Neither the periods nor the high eccentricities are\nexpected. Our goal is to investigate if interactions between a binary and its\ncircumbinary disc during the post-AGB phase can result in their eccentric\norbits, while simultaneously explaining the chemical anomaly known as\ndepletion. For this paper, we selected three binaries (EP Lyr, RU Cen, HD\n46703) with well-constrained orbits, luminosities, and chemical abundances. We\nused the MESA code to evolve post-AGB models, while including the accretion of\nmetal-poor gas. This allows us to constrain the evolution of the stars and\nstudy the impact of circumbinary discs on the orbital properties of the models.\nWe investigate the effect of torques produced by gas inside the binary cavity\nand the effect of Lindblad resonances on the orbit, while also including the\ntidal interaction following the equilibrium tide model. We find that none of\nour models are able to explain the high orbital eccentricities of the binaries\nin our sample. The accretion torque does not significantly impact the binary\norbit, while Lindblad resonances can pump the eccentricity up to only $e\n\\approx 0.2$. At higher eccentricities, the tidal interaction becomes too\nstrong, so the high observed eccentricities cannot be reproduced. However, even\nif we assume tides to be ineffective, the eccentricities in our models do not\nexceed $\\approx 0.25$. We conclude that either our knowledge of disc-binary\ninteractions is still incomplete, or the binaries must have left their phase of\nstrong interaction in an eccentric orbit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Among these approaches are splitting methods. Standard\nsplitting schemes are based on one or another additive splitting of the\noperator into \"simpler\" operators that are more convenient/easier for the\ncomputer implementation and use inhomogeneous (explicitly-implicit) time\napproximations. In this paper, a new class of splitting schemes is proposed\nthat is characterized by an additive representation of the solution instead of\nthe operator corresponding to the problem (called problem operator). A specific\nfeature of the proposed splitting is that the resulting coupled equations for\nindividual solution components consist of the time derivatives of the solution\ncomponents. The proposed approaches are motivated by various applications,\nincluding multiscale methods, domain decomposition, and so on, where spatially\nlocal problems are solved and used to compute the solution. Unconditionally\nstable splitting schemes are constructed for a first-order evolution equation,\nwhich is considered in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. In our splitting\nalgorithms, we consider the decomposition of both the main operator of the\nsystem and the operator at the time derivative. Our goal is to provide a\ngeneral framework that combines temporal splitting algorithms and spatial\ndecomposition and its analysis.

In such systems, AVs are\ncentrally coordinated by the operator, and the HVs might strategically respond\nto the coordination of AVs. We devise computationally tractable strategies to\ncoordinate mixed fleets in MoD systems. Specifically, we model an MoD system\nwith a mixed fleet using a Stackelberg framework where the MoD operator serves\nas the leader and human-driven vehicles serve as the followers. We develop two\nmodels: 1) a steady-state model to analyze the properties of the problem and\ndetermine the planning variables (e.g., compensations, prices, and the fleet\nsize of AVs), and 2) a time-varying model to design a real-time coordination\nalgorithm for AVs.

LiDAR measurements are much less\nsensitive to the aforementioned conditions but LiDAR features are in general\nunsuitable for matching tasks due to their sparse nature. Hence, using both\nLiDAR and RGB can potentially overcome the individual disadvantages of each\nsensor by mutual improvement and yield robust features which can improve the\nmatching process.

In this paper, we consider correcting duplication errors for both\nexact and noisy tandem duplications of a given length k. An exact duplication\ninserts a copy of a substring of length k of the sequence immediately after\nthat substring, e.g., ACGT to ACGACGT, where k = 3, while a noisy duplication\ninserts a copy suffering from substitution noise, e.g., ACGT to ACGATGT.\nSpecifically, we design codes that can correct any number of exact duplication\nand one noisy duplication errors, where in the noisy duplication case the copy\nis at Hamming distance 1 from the original. Our constructions rely upon\nrecovering the duplication root of the stored codeword. We characterize the\nways in which duplication errors manifest in the root of affected sequences and\ndesign efficient codes for correcting these error patterns.

Thus, it\nis sensible to discover high-utility itemsets (HUIs) in transaction databases\nwhile utilizing not only the quantity but also the predefined utility.

These\nparameters are fixed to a gold standard value or adjusted through hit and\ntrial. This paper presents a first study to analyze and optimize A5 parameters\nfor jointly maximizing two key performance indicators (KPIs): Reference signal\nreceived power (RSRP) and handover success rate (HOSR). As analytical modeling\ncannot capture the system-level complexity, a data driven approach is used. By\ndeveloping XGBoost based model, that outperforms other models in terms of\naccuracy, we first analyze the concurrent impact of the three parameters on the\ntwo KPIs. The results reveal three key insights: 1) there exist optimal\nparameter values for each KPI; 2) these optimal values do not necessarily\nbelong to the current gold standard; 3) the optimal parameter values for the\ntwo KPIs do not overlap. We then leverage the Sobol variance-based sensitivity\nanalysis to draw some insights which can be used to avoid the parametric\nconflict while jointly maximizing both KPIs. We formulate the joint RSRP and\nHOSR optimization problem, show that it is non-convex and solve it using the\ngenetic algorithm (GA).

First\nunconstrained methods are revisited and they are shown to correspond to the\napplication of a linear filter followed by a nonlinear estimate of the\neffective reproduction number after a change-of-coordinates. Unconstrained\nmethods often fail to keep the estimated variables within their physical range\nand can lead to unreliable estimates that require aggressively smoothing the\nraw data. In order to overcome these shortcomings a constrained estimation\nmethod is proposed that keeps the model variables within pre-specified\nboundaries and can also promote smoothness of the estimates. Constrained\nestimation can be directly applied to raw data without the need of\npre-smoothing and the associated loss of information and additional lag. It can\nalso be easily extended to handle additional information, such as the number of\ninfected individuals. The resulting problem is cast as a convex quadratic\noptimization problem with linear and convex quadratic constraints.

Fully\nautomated treatment planning processes could reduce a planner's active\ntreatment planning time and remove inter-planner variability, with the\npotential to tremendously improve patient turnover and quality of care. In\ndeveloping fully automated algorithms for treatment planning, we have two main\nobjectives: to produce plans that are 1) Pareto optimal and 2) clinically\nacceptable. Here, we propose the Pareto optimal projection search (POPS)\nalgorithm, which provides a general framework for directly searching the Pareto\nfront. Methods: Our POPS algorithm is a novel automated planning method that\ncombines two main search processes: 1) gradient-free search in the decision\nvariable space and 2) projection of decision variables to the Pareto front\nusing the bisection method. We demonstrate the performance of POPS by comparing\nwith clinical treatment plans. As one possible quantitative measure of\ntreatment plan quality, we construct a clinical acceptability scoring function\n(SF) modified from the previously developed general evaluation metric (GEM).\nResults: On a dataset of 21 prostate cases collected as part of clinical\nworkflow, our proposed POPS algorithm produces Pareto optimal plans that are\nclinically acceptable in regards to dose conformity, dose homogeneity, and\nsparing of organs-at-risk. Conclusion: Our proposed POPS algorithm provides a\ngeneral framework for fully automated treatment planning that achieves\nclinically acceptable dosimetric quality without requiring active planning from\nhuman planners. Significance: Our fully automated POPS algorithm addresses many\nkey limitations of other automated planning approaches, and we anticipate that\nit will substantially improve treatment planning workflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 00:27:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 00:34:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2021 08:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

In this work, we facilitate this task by providing a synthesis\nof, and a roadmap to this ever-expanding analytical landscape and highlighting\nits major landmarks and pathways.

Herein, starting\nfrom the basic concepts, for a general solid-liquid crystallization system, we\nexpand the Gibbs-Thomson (GT) equation to second order, and derive the\nsecond-order analytical formulas of $\\Delta \\mu$, $\\gamma$ and nucleation\nbarrier $\\Delta G$ with combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These\nformulas describe well the temperature dependence of these thermodynamic\nparameters. Our results can provide a method of estimating $\\Delta \\mu$,\n$\\gamma$ and $\\Delta G$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 03:17:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 03:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

We study\nthe relationship between rainfall and Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR,\nconvective cloud cover) for monsoon between 2004-2010. To identify, classify\nand visualize spatial patterns of rainfall and OLR we use a discrete and\nspatio-temporally coherent representation of the data, created using a\nstatistical model based on Markov Random Field. Our approach clusters the days\nwith similar spatial distributions of rainfall and OLR into a small number of\nspatial patterns. We find that eight daily spatial patterns each in rainfall\nand OLR, and seven joint patterns of rainfall and OLR, describe over 90\\% of\nall days. Through these patterns, we find that OLR generally has a strong\nnegative correlation with precipitation, but with significant spatial\nvariations. In particular, peninsular India (except west coast) is under\nsignificant convective cloud cover over a majority of days but remains\nrainless. We also find that much of the monsoon rainfall co-occurs with low\nOLR, but some amount of rainfall in Eastern and North-western India in June\noccurs on OLR days, presumably from shallow clouds. To study day-to-day\nvariations of both quantities, we identify spatial patterns in the temporal\ngradients computed from the observations. We find that changes in convective\ncloud activity across India most commonly occur due to the establishment of a\nnorth-south OLR gradient which persists for 1-2 days and shifts the convective\ncloud cover from light to deep or vice versa. Such changes are also accompanied\nby changes in the spatial distribution of precipitation. The present work thus\nprovides a highly reduced description of the complex spatial patterns and their\nday-to-day variations, and could form a useful tool for future simplified\ndescriptions of this process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 04:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

Like the single channel Euler's elastica model and the total\nvariation (TV) models, geometric measures that involve high order derivatives\ncould help when considering image formation models that minimize elastic\nproperties. In the past, the Polyakov action from high energy physics has been\nsuccessfully applied to color image processing.

Since the optimal solution of\ndistributionally robust optimization is required to be feasible for all\nuncertain distributions in a given ambiguity distribution set and so the\nconservatism of the optimal solution is inevitable. To address this issue, we\nintroduce the globalized distributionally robust counterpart (GDRC) which\nallows constraint violations controlled by functional distance of the true\ndistribution to the inner uncertainty distribution set. We obtain the\ndeterministic equivalent forms for several GDRCs under the moment-based\nframework. To be specific, we show the deterministic equivalent system of\ninequalities for the GDRCs under second order moment information with a\nseparable distance function and a jointly convex distance function,\nrespectively. Moreover, the feasible set of the system is convex. We also\ndevelop the deterministic equivalent inequality for the GDRC under first order\nmoment and support information. The computationally tractable examples are\npresented for these GDRCs. A numerical tests of a portfolio optimization\nproblem is given to show the efficiency of our methods and the results\ndemonstrate that the globalized distributionally robust solutions is\nnon-conservative and flexible compared to the distributionally robust\nsolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 04:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-20"}

In the last few years, deep learning based semantic\nsegmentation methods have significantly advanced the skin lesion segmentation\nresults. However, the current performance is still unsatisfactory due to some\nchallenging factors such as large variety of lesion scale and ambiguous\ndifference between lesion region and background. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple yet effective framework, named Dual Objective Networks (DONet), to\nimprove the skin lesion segmentation. Our DONet adopts two symmetric decoders\nto produce different predictions for approaching different objectives.\nConcretely, the two objectives are actually defined by different loss\nfunctions. In this way, the two decoders are encouraged to produce\ndifferentiated probability maps to match different optimization targets,\nresulting in complementary predictions accordingly. The complementary\ninformation learned by these two objectives are further aggregated together to\nmake the final prediction, by which the uncertainty existing in segmentation\nmaps can be significantly alleviated. Besides, to address the challenge of\nlarge variety of lesion scales and shapes in dermoscopic images, we\nadditionally propose a recurrent context encoding module (RCEM) to model the\ncomplex correlation among skin lesions, where the features with different scale\ncontexts are efficiently integrated to form a more robust representation.\nExtensive experiments on two popular benchmarks well demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed DONet. In particular, our DONet achieves 0.881\nand 0.931 dice score on ISIC 2018 and $\\text{PH}^2$, respectively.

However, although ripples are\nfairly well understood, less is known about their origin and controlled\nmodification. Here, motivated by recent reports of laser-controlled creation of\nline defects in graphene, we investigate how line defects could be used to\ncontrol rippling in graphene and other two-dimensional materials. By sequential\nmulti-scale coupling of density-functional tight-binding and continuum\nelasticity simulations, we quantify the amount of rippling when the number and\nthe cumulative length of the line defects increase. Simulations show that\nelastic sheets with networks of line defects create rippling that induces\nconsiderable out-of-plane rigidification and in-plane softening with non-linear\nelastic behavior. We hope that these insights help to guide experimental\nattempts to modify the mechanical properties of graphene and other\ntwo-dimensional materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 06:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-20"}

It is challenging as the intent of the agent and the\ncorresponding behavior is unknown and intrinsically multimodal. Our key insight\nis that for prediction within a moderate time horizon, the future modes can be\neffectively captured by a set of target states. This leads to our target-driven\ntrajectory prediction (TNT) framework. TNT has three stages which are trained\nend-to-end. It first predicts an agent's potential target states $T$ steps into\nthe future, by encoding its interactions with the environment and the other\nagents. TNT then generates trajectory state sequences conditioned on targets. A\nfinal stage estimates trajectory likelihoods and a final compact set of\ntrajectory predictions is selected. This is in contrast to previous work which\nmodels agent intents as latent variables, and relies on test-time sampling to\ngenerate diverse trajectories. We benchmark TNT on trajectory prediction of\nvehicles and pedestrians, where we outperform state-of-the-art on Argoverse\nForecasting, INTERACTION, Stanford Drone and an in-house\nPedestrian-at-Intersection dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 06:52:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 07:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-24"}

To study people's preferences,\neconomics researchers have proposed the hypothesis of Expected Utility (EU)\nthat models the subject value associated with an individual's choice as the\nstatistical expectations of that individual's valuations of the outcomes of\nthis choice. Despite its success in studies of game theory and decision theory,\nthe effectiveness of EU, however, is mostly unknown in e-commerce\nrecommendation systems. Previous research on e-commerce recommendation\ninterprets the utility of purchase decisions either as a function of the\nconsumed quantity of the product or as the gain of sellers/buyers in the\nmonetary sense. As most consumers just purchase one unit of a product at a time\nand most alternatives have similar prices, such modeling of purchase utility is\nlikely to be inaccurate in practice. In this paper, we interpret purchase\nutility as the satisfaction level a consumer gets from a product and propose a\nrecommendation framework using EU to model consumers' behavioral patterns. We\nassume that consumer estimates the expected utilities of all the alternatives\nand choose products with maximum expected utility for each purchase.

In order to avoid a strong computational cost scaling with the\nnetwork size, we aggregate consumer constraints with a constraint aggregation\nstrategy. Moreover, to align this continuous optimization strategy with the\ndiscrete nature of topology optimization and pipe size choices, we present a\nnumerical continuation strategy that gradually forces the design variables\ntowards discrete design choices. As such, optimal network topology and pipe\nsizes are determined simultaneously. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of\nthe algorithm by designing a fictitious district heating network with 160\nconsumers. As a proof-of-concept, the network is optimized for minimal\ninvestment cost and pumping power, while keeping the heat supplied to the\nconsumers within a thermal comfort range of 5 %. Starting from a uniform\ndistribution of 15 cm wide piping throughout the network, the novel algorithm\nfinds a network lay-out that reduces piping investment by 23 % and pump-related\ncosts by a factor of 14 in less than an hour on a standard laptop. Moreover,\nthe importance of embedding the non-linear transport model is clear from a\ntemperature-induced variation in the consumer flow rates of 72 %.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 08:37:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 17:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-19"}

In contrast to the centralized data storage and processing in CLNs,\nFLNs exploit a number of edge devices (EDs) to store data and perform training\ndistributively. In this way, the EDs in FLNs can keep training data locally,\nwhich preserves privacy and reduces communication overheads. However, since the\nmodel training within FLNs relies on the contribution of all EDs, the training\nprocess can be disrupted if some of the EDs upload incorrect or falsified\ntraining results, i.e., poisoning attacks. In this paper, we review the\nvulnerabilities of FLNs, and particularly give an overview of poisoning attacks\nand mainstream countermeasures. Nevertheless, the existing countermeasures can\nonly provide passive protection and fail to consider the training fees paid for\nthe contributions of the EDs, resulting in a unnecessarily high training cost.\nHence, we present a smart security enhancement framework for FLNs. In\nparticular, a verify-before-aggregate (VBA) procedure is developed to identify\nand remove the non-benign training results from the EDs.

We show that this phenomenon is caused neither by surface\nerosion effect nor by a non-uniform volumetric expansion. Rather, atomic\nredistribution in the bulk of the material is the only drive for the ripple\nsurface. Furthermore, the deformation of the Ge layer likely occurs to largest\nextend after irradiation, as indicated by the very flat interface around the\nend-of-range region.

Because this last question is\nunanswerable with classical link prediction, here we investigate the use of\ngraph association rules to inform multiplex link prediction. We derive such\nrules by identifying all frequent patterns in a network via multiplex graph\nmining, and then score each unobserved link's likelihood by finding the\noccurrences of each rule in the original network.

In our experiments, we show that, exploiting graph association\nrules, we are able to achieve a prediction performance close to an ideal\nensemble classifier.

This\nquantitative and qualitative device-to-device variation is described in terms\nof continuous and discontinuous nonlinear transitions between linear current\nintervals. The thin film grain microstructure in our samples is determined\nusing atomic force and scanning electron microscopy to be on the scale of 30\nnm.

However, the scalability of such applications is\nlargely limited by the entanglement decoherence caused by photon loss. One\npromising method to combat such losses is noiseless linear amplification.\nHowever, while there have been various procedures that implement noiseless\nlinear amplification on single-mode states, no realization has thus far been\nproposed for noiseless linear amplification on quantum states carrying a\nmultimode structure. In this work we close this gap, proposing a novel\nNoiseless Linear Amplifier (NLA) with Photon Catalysis (PC), namely, the\nPC-NLA.

A system of the form\n$\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t)=f(\\mathbf{x})$ has an additional term\n$G(\\mathbf{x}(t)-\\mathbf{x}(t-T))$ introduced where $G$ is some `gain matrix'\nand $T$ a time delay. The form of the delay term is such that it will vanish\nfor any orbit of period $T,$ therefore making it also an orbit of the\nuncontrolled system. This non-invasive feature makes the method attractive for\nstabilising exact coherent structures in fluid turbulence. Here we begin by\nvalidating the method for the basic flow in Kolmogorov flow; a two-dimensional\nincompressible Navier-Stokes flow with a sinusoidal body force. The linear\npredictions for stabilisation are well captured by direct numerical simulation.\nBy applying an adaptive method to adjust the streamwise translation of the\ndelay, a known travelling wave solution is able to be stabilised up to\nrelatively high Reynolds number. We discover that the famous `odd-number'\nlimitation of this time-delayed feedback method can be overcome in the fluid\nproblem by using the symmetries of the system. This leads to the discovery of 8\nadditional exact coherent structures which can be stabilised with this\napproach. This means that certain unstable exact coherent structures can be\nobtained by simply time-stepping a modified set of equations, thus\ncircumventing the usual convergence algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 11:45:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 14:12:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 16:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

However, in previous methods, label\ncorrelation is computed based on statistical information of data and therefore\nthe same for all samples, and this makes graph inference on labels insufficient\nto handle huge variations among numerous image instances. In this paper, we\npropose an instance-aware graph convolutional neural network (IA-GCN) framework\nfor multi-label classification. As a whole, two fused branches of sub-networks\nare involved in the framework: a global branch modeling the whole image and a\nregion-based branch exploring dependencies among regions of interests (ROIs).\nFor label diffusion of instance-awareness in graph convolution, rather than\nusing the statistical label correlation alone, an image-dependent label\ncorrelation matrix (LCM), fusing both the statistical LCM and an individual one\nof each image instance, is constructed for graph inference on labels to inject\nadaptive information of label-awareness into the learned features of the model.\nSpecifically, the individual LCM of each image is obtained by mining the label\ndependencies based on the scores of labels about detected ROIs. In this\nprocess, considering the contribution differences of ROIs to multi-label\nclassification, variational inference is introduced to learn adaptive scaling\nfactors for those ROIs by considering their complex distribution.

We also construct polygons with maximal compatible matchings\nwith n/7 edges, demonstrating the tightness of this bound. Tight bounds on the\nsize of a minimal maximal compatible matching are also obtained for the\nfamilies of d-regular geometric graphs for each d in {0,1,2}. Finally we\nconsider a related problem.

Two events often\nobserved in those experiments are the excitation of the $m=2, n=1$\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) mode, and the formation of cold bubble structure in\nthe temperature distribution before the thermal quench (TQ). Here $m$ is the\npoloidal mode number, $n$ the toroidal mode number. The physics mechanisms\nunderlying those phenomena, however, have not been entirely clear. In this\nwork, our recent NIMROD simulations of the MGI process in a tokamak have\nreproduced the main features of both events, which has allowed us to examine\nand establish the causal relation between them. In these simulations, the $3/1$\nand $2/1$ islands are found to form successively after the arrival of impurity\nion cold front at the corresponding $q = 3$ and $q = 2$ rational surfaces. At\nthe interface between impurity and plasma, a local thin current sheet forms due\nto an enhanced local pressure gradient and moves inward following the gas cold\nfront, this may contribute to the formation of a dominant $2/1$ mode.

Unsupervised domain\nadaptation is a promising avenue which transfers knowledge from a source domain\nto a target domain without using any labels in the target domain. Contemporary\ntechniques focus on extracting domain-invariant features using domain\nadversarial training. However, these techniques neglect to learn discriminative\nclass boundaries in the latent representation space on a target domain and\nyield limited adaptation performance. To address this problem, we propose\ndistance metric guided feature alignment (MetFA) to extract discriminative as\nwell as domain-invariant features on both source and target domains. The\nproposed MetFA method explicitly and directly learns the latent representation\nwithout using domain adversarial training. Our model integrates class\ndistribution alignment to transfer semantic knowledge from a source domain to a\ntarget domain. We evaluate the proposed method on fetal ultrasound datasets for\ncross-device image classification.

We perform an indirect detection analysis to study\nhow the $\\nu$MSM parameter-space constraints are affected by said interactions.\nWe compute the X-ray fluxes considering a DM profile that self-consistently\naccounts for the particle physics model by using an updated version of the\nRuffini-Arg\\\"uelles-Rueda (RAR) fermionic (\"ino\") model, instead of\nphenomenological profiles such as the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) distribution.\nWe show that the RAR profile accounting for interacting DM, is compatible with\nmeasurements of the Galaxy rotation curve and constraints on the DM\nself-interacting cross section from the Bullet cluster. A new analysis of the\nX-ray NuSTAR data in the central parsec of the Milky Way, is here performed to\nderive constraints on the self-interacting sterile neutrino parameter-space.\nSuch constraints are stronger than those obtained with commonly used DM\nprofiles, due to the dense DM core characteristic of the RAR profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 17:40:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 11:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}

One such exciting possibility\nis cannibalistic dark matter (CanDM), which has exothermal number-changing\ninteractions allowing it to stay warm far into its non-relativistic regime.\nHere we investigate the cosmological implications of CanDM and how it impacts\nCMB anisotropies and the matter power spectrum, by implementing the model\nwithin a linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver. We show that CanDM suppresses the\nsmall scale matter power spectrum in a way very similar to light Warm Dark\nMatter or Hot Dark Matter.

We\nput strong constraints on the interaction strength of CanDM as a function of\nits abundance for both constant and temperature-dependent thermally-averaged\ncross sections. We find that the CanDM model can easily solve the $S_8$ tension\n(but has no impact on the Hubble tension). Indeed, it can accommodate values of\n$S_8$ of the order of 0.76 while being compatible with CMB+BAO data.

Yet, the fate of the impactors and their\neffects on Mercury's surface through the bombardment epoch are not clear. Using\nMonte-Carlo and analytical approaches of cratering impacts, we investigate the\nphysical and thermodynamical outcomes of late accretion on Mercury. Considering\nthe uncertainties in late accretion, we develop scaling laws for the following\nparameters as a function of impact velocity and total mass of late accretion:\n(1) depth of crustal erosion, (2) the degree of resurfacing, and (3) mass\naccreted from impactor material. Existing dynamical models indicate that\nMercury experienced an intense impact bombardment (a total mass of $\\sim 8\n\\times 10^{18} - 8 \\times 10^{20}$ kg with a typical impact velocity of $30-40$\nkm s$^{-1}$) after $4.5$ Ga. With this, we find that late accretion could\nremove 50 m to 10 km of the early crust of Mercury, but the change to its\ncore-to-mantle ratio is negligible. Alternatively, the mantles of putative\ndifferentiated planetesimals in the early solar system could be more easily\nremoved and their respective core fraction increased, if Mercury ultimately\naccreted from such objects. Although the cratering is notable for erasing the\nolder geological surface records on Mercury, we show that $\\sim 40-50$ wt% of\nthe impactor's exogenic materials, including the volatile-bearing materials,\ncan be heterogeneously implanted on Mercury's surface as a late veneer\n($>3\\times 10^{18}-1.6 \\times 10^{19}$ kg in total). About half of the accreted\nimpactor's materials are vaporized, and the rest is completely melted upon the\nimpact.

First, in order to validate the proposed approach, the\nsolution found in a (deterministic) unperturbed scenario is compared with the\noptimal one provided by an indirect technique. Then, the robustness and\noptimality of the obtained closed-loop guidance laws is assessed by means of\nMonte Carlo campaigns performed in the considered uncertain scenarios. These\npreliminary results open up new horizons for the use of reinforcement learning\nin the robust design of interplanetary missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 15:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-20"}

But a lack of annotations makes\nthe existing approaches not applicable to movie key moment detection. To get\nrid of human annotations, we leverage the officially-released trailers as the\nweak supervision to learn a model that can detect the key moments from\nfull-length movies. We introduce a novel ranking network that utilizes the\nCo-Attention between movies and trailers as guidance to generate the training\npairs, where the moments highly corrected with trailers are expected to be\nscored higher than the uncorrelated moments. Additionally, we propose a\nContrastive Attention module to enhance the feature representations such that\nthe comparative contrast between features of the key and non-key moments are\nmaximized. We construct the first movie-trailer dataset, and the proposed\nCo-Attention assisted ranking network shows superior performance even over the\nsupervised approach.

The ultrafast laser ablation is accomplished\nwith the insertion of a transition metal interlayer that offers high\nelectron-phonon coupling to trigger vaporization in a picosecond timescale.\nThis contained form of heat transfer permits lifting off the metal thin-film\nlayer while blocking heat conduction to the substrate.

It is central in data compression, as well as in efficient query\nalgorithms for sequence data, such as webpages, genomic and other biological\nsequences, or indeed any textual data. The BWT lends itself well to compression\nbecause its number of equal-letter-runs (usually referred to as $r$) is often\nconsiderably lower than that of the original string; in particular, it is well\nsuited for strings with many repeated factors. In fact, much attention has been\npaid to the $r$ parameter as measure of repetitiveness, especially to evaluate\nthe performance in terms of both space and time of compressed indexing data\nstructures.\n  In this paper, we investigate $\\rho(v)$, the ratio of $r$ and of the number\nof runs of the BWT of the reverse of $v$.

A\ncommon model of such a system is a network of $N$ parallel queues in which\nincoming jobs with independent and identically distributed service times are\nrouted on arrival using the join-the-shortest-of-$d$-queues routing algorithm.\nUnder fairly general conditions, it was shown by Aghajani and Ramanan that as\n$N\\rightarrow\\infty$, the state dynamics converges to the unique solution of a\ncountable system of coupled deterministic measure-valued equations called the\nhydrodynamic equations. In this article, a characterization of invariant states\nof these hydrodynamic equations is obtained and, when $d=2$, used to construct\na numerical algorithm to compute the queue length distribution and mean virtual\nwaiting time in the invariant state. Additionally, it is also shown that under\na suitable tail condition on the service distribution, the queue length\ndistribution of the invariant state exhibits a doubly exponential tail decay,\nthus demonstrating a vast improvement in performance over the case $d=1$, which\ncorresponds to random routing, when the tail decay could even be polynomial.\nFurthermore, numerical evidence is provided to support the conjecture that the\ninvariant state is the limit of the steady-state distributions of the\n$N$-server models.

Their extreme proximity (0.50\", 0.27\") to a\nbright optical source and their extreme faintness prevented them from being\nincluded in the H-band catalog. We present the spectroscopic scan follow-up of\nfive of the six sources with ALMA band 4. All are detected in the 2mm continuum\nwith signal-to-noise ratios higher than eight. One emission line is detected in\nAGS4 (\\nu_{obs} =151.44GHz with a S/N=8.58) and AGS17 (\\nu_{obs} =154.78GHz\nwith a S/N=10.23), which we interpret in both cases as being due to the CO(6-5)\nline at z^{AGS4}_{spec}=3.556 and z^{AGS4}_{spec}=3.467, respectively. These\nredshifts match both the probability distribution of the photometric redshifts\nderived from the UV to near-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and\nthe far-infrared SEDs for typical dust temperatures of galaxies at these\nredshifts. We present evidence that nearly 70% (4/6 of galaxies) of the\noptically dark galaxies belong to the same overdensity of galaxies at z~3.5.\noverdensity The most massive one, AGS24 (M_{\\star} = 10^{11.32^{+0.02}_{-0.19}}\nM_{\\odot}), is the most massive galaxy without an active galactic nucleus (AGN)\nat $z$\\,>\\,3 in the GOODS-ALMA field.

Batching orders\ntogether in the picking process to form a single picking route, reduces travel\ndistance. The reason for its importance is that order picking is a labor\nintensive process and, by using good batching methods, substantial savings can\nbe obtained. The BOBP is a NP-hard combinational optimization problem and\ndesigning a good problem-specific heuristic under the quasi-real-time system\nresponse requirement is non-trivial. In this paper, rather than designing\nheuristics, we propose an end-to-end learning and optimization framework named\nBalanced Task-orientated Graph Clustering Network (BTOGCN) to solve the BOBP by\nreducing it to balanced graph clustering optimization problem. In BTOGCN, a\ntask-oriented estimator network is introduced to guide the type-aware\nheterogeneous graph clustering networks to find a better clustering result\nrelated to the BOBP objective.

We propose a simulated environment\nin which continuous or discrete control policies can be trained to control the\ncomplete behavior of soccer agents and a sim-to-real method based on domain\nadaptation to adapt the obtained policies to real robots. Our results show that\nthe trained policies learned a broad repertoire of behaviors that are difficult\nto implement with handcrafted control policies. With VSSS-RL, we were able to\nbeat human-designed policies in the 2019 Latin American Robotics Competition\n(LARC), achieving 4th place out of 21 teams, being the first to apply\nReinforcement Learning (RL) successfully in this competition.

Existing state-of-the-art graph embedding based methods such as\npredictive text embedding (PTE) and TextGCN have shortcomings in terms of\npredictive performance, scalability and inductive capability. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a heterogeneous graph convolutional network (HeteGCN)\nmodeling approach that unites the best aspects of PTE and TextGCN together. The\nmain idea is to learn feature embeddings and derive document embeddings using a\nHeteGCN architecture with different graphs used across layers. We simplify\nTextGCN by dissecting into several HeteGCN models which (a) helps to study the\nusefulness of individual models and (b) offers flexibility in fusing learned\nembeddings from different models. In effect, the number of model parameters is\nreduced significantly, enabling faster training and improving performance in\nsmall labeled training set scenario. Our detailed experimental studies\ndemonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 12:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

An important breakthrough for\nindustrial applications has been made with the development of industrial\napproaches to velocity model building. We propose an extension of these\napproaches, sampling an equi-probable contour of the tomography posterior\nprobability density function (pdf) rather than the full pdf, and using\nnon-linear slope tomography (rather than standard tomographic migration\nvelocity analysis as in previous publications). Our approach allows to assess\nthe quality of uncertainty-related assumptions (linearity and Gaussian\nhypothesis within the Bayesian theory) and estimate volumetric migration\npositioning uncertainties (a generalization of horizon uncertainties), in\naddition to the advantages in terms of efficiency. We derive the theoretical\nconcepts underlying this approach and unify our derivations with those of\nprevious publications. As the method works in the full model space rather than\nin a preconditioned model space, we split the analysis into the resolved and\nunresolved tomography spaces. We argue that the resolved space uncertainties\nare to be used in further steps leading to decision-making and can be related\nto the output of methods that work in a preconditioned model space. The\nunresolved space uncertainties represent a qualitative byproduct specific to\nour method, strongly highlighting the most uncertain gross areas, thus useful\nfor QCs. These concepts are demonstrated on a synthetic data. Complementarily,\nthe industrial viability of the method is illustrated on two different 3D field\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 10:17:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 10:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}
