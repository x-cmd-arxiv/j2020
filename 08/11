An attention condenser is a self-attention mechanism that learns and\nproduces a condensed embedding characterizing joint local and cross-channel\nactivation relationships, and performs selective attention accordingly. To\nillustrate its efficacy, we introduce TinySpeech, low-precision deep neural\nnetworks comprising largely of attention condensers tailored for on-device\nspeech recognition using a machine-driven design exploration strategy, with one\ntailored specifically with microcontroller operation constraints. Experimental\nresults on the Google Speech Commands benchmark dataset for limited-vocabulary\nspeech recognition showed that TinySpeech networks achieved significantly lower\narchitectural complexity (as much as $507\\times$ fewer parameters), lower\ncomputational complexity (as much as $48\\times$ fewer multiply-add operations),\nand lower storage requirements (as much as $2028\\times$ lower weight memory\nrequirements) when compared to previous work. These results not only\ndemonstrate the efficacy of attention condensers for building highly efficient\nnetworks for on-device speech recognition, but also illuminate its potential\nfor accelerating deep learning on the edge and empowering TinyML applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:34:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 01:37:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 14:46:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 00:28:33 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 04:07:50 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 19:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Hence, it is important\nto understand the influence of testing on treatment selection in general\npractice. Most statistical methods focus on average effects of testing on\ntreatment decisions. However, this may be ill-advised, particularly for patient\nsubgroups that tend not to benefit from such tests. Furthermore, missing data\nare common, representing large and often unaddressed threats to the validity of\nstatistical methods. Finally, it is desirable to conduct analyses that can be\ninterpreted causally. We propose to classify patients into four potential\noutcomes subgroups, defined by whether or not a patient's treatment selection\nis changed by the test result and by the direction of how the test result\nchanges treatment selection. This subgroup classification naturally captures\nthe differential influence of medical testing on treatment selections for\ndifferent patients, which can suggest targets to improve the utilization of\nmedical tests. We can then examine patient characteristics associated with\npatient potential outcomes subgroup memberships. We used multiple imputation\nmethods to simultaneously impute the missing potential outcomes as well as\nregular missing values. This approach can also provide estimates of many\ntraditional causal quantities. We find that explicitly incorporating causal\ninference assumptions into the multiple imputation process can improve the\nprecision for some causal estimates of interest. We also find that bias can\noccur when the potential outcomes conditional independence assumption is\nviolated; sensitivity analyses are proposed to assess the impact of this\nviolation.

Typically, the forward flux through the creatine-kinase\nreaction is investigated by observing the decrease in phosphocreatine (PCr)\nafter saturation of $\\gamma$-ATP. The quantification of total ATP utilisation\nis currently under-explored, as it requires simultaneous saturation of\ninorganic phosphate (Pi) and PCr. This is challenging, as currently available\nsaturation pulses reduce the already-low $\\gamma$-ATP signal present.\n  Methods: Using a hybrid optimal-control and Shinnar-Le-Roux method, a\nquasi-adiabatic RF pulse was designed for the dual-saturation of PCr and Pi to\nenable determination of total ATP utilisation. The pulses were evaluated in\nBloch equation simulations, compared with a conventional hard-cosine DANTE\nsaturation sequence, before application to perfused rat hearts at 11.7 Tesla.\n  Results: The quasi-adiabatic pulse was insensitive to a $>2.5$-fold variation\nin $B_1$, producing equivalent saturation with a 53% reduction in delivered\npulse power and a 33-fold reduction in spillover at the minimum effective\n$B_1$.

Beside their broad applicability and well-known success,\ntransport maps suffer from several drawbacks such as numerical inaccuracies\ninduced by the optimization process and the fact that sampling schemes have to\nbe employed when quantities of interest, e.g. moments are to compute. This\npaper presents a novel method for the accurate functional approximation of\nprobability density functions (PDF) that copes with those issues. By\ninterpreting the pull-back result of a target PDF through an inexact transport\nmap as a perturbed reference density, a subsequent functional representation in\na more accessible format allows for efficient and more accurate computation of\nthe desired quantities. We introduce a layer-based approximation of the\nperturbed reference density in an appropriate coordinate system to split the\nhigh-dimensional representation problem into a set of independent\napproximations for which separately chosen orthonormal basis functions are\navailable. This effectively motivates the notion of h- and p-refinement (i.e.\n``mesh size'' and polynomial degree) for the approximation of high-dimensional\nPDFs. To circumvent the curse of dimensionality and enable sampling-free access\nto certain quantities of interest, a low-rank reconstruction in the tensor\ntrain format is employed via the Variational Monte Carlo method. An a priori\nconvergence analysis of the developed approach is derived in terms of Hellinger\ndistance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

To address the scatter problem, we\nhave been investigating the feasibility of a two dimensional antiscatter grid\n(2D ASG) concept for FPDs. Although a 2D ASG can potentially provide high\nscatter rejection capability, primary transmission characteristics of a 2D ASG\nand its implications in image quality plays a more critical role in\nimplementation of the 2D ASG concept. Thus, in this work, a computational model\nwas developed to investigate the primary transmission properties of the 2D ASG\nfor various grid and FPD pixel geometries, and the improvement in signal to\nnoise ratio,SNR, was calculated analytically to demonstrate the impact of 2D\nASG's transmission characteristics on image quality. Computational model showed\nthat average primary transmission fraction (Tp) strongly depends on the septal\nthickness of 2D ASG, and 2D ASG can provide higher Tp than existing\nradiographic ASGs at a septal thickness of 0.1 mm. Due to the higher Tp, 2D ASG\nwas also predicted to provide SNR improvements in projections in low to\nmoderate scatter environments typically observed in CBCT imaging. On the other\nhand, the model also indicated that the shadow or footprint of the 2D ASG leads\nto spatially nonuniform variations in primary signal in FPD pixels. Reduction\nof septal thickness and optimization of 2D ASG's pitch may play an essential\nrole in reducing such variations in primary image signal, and avoiding\npotential image artifacts associated with 2D ASG's footprint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 17:13:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

Though originally measured in lower\nenergy fixed target experiments, they have been found to persist in collisions\nwith momentum transfer well into the perturbative regime of quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD) and yet their origin remains poorly understood. TSSA\nmeasurements have allowed for the development of both transverse momentum\ndependent and collinear twist-3 descriptions of nonperturbative spin-momentum\ncorrelations for both initial- and final-state effects.

Our simulated atmospheric HCN profile agrees very\nwell with the Cassini observations. CRAHCN contains 104 reactions however\nnearly all of the simulated atmospheric HCN profile can be obtained using a\nscaled down network of only 19 dominant reactions.

Their effect on the redshifted 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen is\nusually neglected, as it is assumed that the associated background is small.\nRecently, an excess radio background above the level of the CMB has been\nproposed as one of the possible explanations for the unusually strong 21-cm\nsignal from redshift $z\\sim 17$ reported by the EDGES collaboration. As a\nresult, the implications of a smooth and extremely strong excess radio\nbackground on both the sky-averaged (global) 21-cm signal and its fluctuations\nhave been considered.

However,\nat PeV (10$^{15}$ eV) energies and above, most of the universe is impenetrable\nto photons. New messengers, namely cosmic neutrinos, are needed to explore the\nmost extreme environments of the universe where black holes, neutron stars, and\nstellar explosions transform gravitational energy into non-thermal cosmic rays.\nThe discovery of cosmic neutrinos with IceCube has opened this new window on\nthe universe. In this white paper, we present an overview of a next-generation\ninstrument, IceCube-Gen2, which will sharpen our understanding of the processes\nand environments that govern the universe at the highest energies. IceCube-Gen2\nis designed to: 1) Resolve the high-energy neutrino sky from TeV to EeV\nenergies; 2) Investigate cosmic particle acceleration through multi-messenger\nobservations; 3) Reveal the sources and propagation of the highest energy\nparticles in the universe; 4) Probe fundamental physics with high-energy\nneutrinos. IceCube-Gen2 will increase the annual rate of observed cosmic\nneutrinos by a factor of ten compared to IceCube, and will be able to detect\nsources five times fainter than its predecessor. Furthermore, through the\naddition of a radio array, IceCube-Gen2 will extend the energy range by several\norders of magnitude compared to IceCube. Construction will take 8 years and\ncost about \\$350M. The goal is to have IceCube-Gen2 fully operational by 2033.\nIceCube-Gen2 will play an essential role in shaping the new era of\nmulti-messenger astronomy, fundamentally advancing our knowledge of the\nhigh-energy universe. This challenging mission can be fully addressed only in\nconcert with the new survey instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum and\ngravitational wave detectors which will be available in the coming years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-06"}

We\nfind adjusted masses, $M_\\mathrm{500c},$ that are $\\lesssim$15% higher and\nscaled pressures $P/P_\\mathrm{500c}$ that have $\\lesssim$35% lower\nnormalization than previously inferred. Our Debiased Pressure Profile (DPP) is\nwell-fit by a Generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (GNFW) function, with parameters\n$[P_0,c_{500},\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma]=[5.048,1.217,1.192,5.490,0.433]$ and does\nnot require a mass-dependent correction term. When the DPP is used to model the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, we find that the integrated Compton $Y-M$\nrelation has only minor deviations from self-similar scaling. The thermal SZ\nangular power spectrum is lower in amplitude by approximately 30%, assuming\nnominal cosmological parameters (e.g. $\\Omega_\\text{m}=0.3$, $\\sigma_8 = 0.8$),\nand is broadly consistent with recent Planck results without requiring\nadditional bias corrections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:01:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 21:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

Known as phantom jams, this phenomenon has been identified\nin the literature as one of the main causes of traffic congestion. This paper\nis based on the premise that vehicle automation and connectivity can help\nmitigate such jams. In the paper, we design a controller for use in a connected\nand autonomous vehicle (CAV) to stabilize the flow of human-driven vehicles\n(HDVs) that are upstream of the CAV, and consequently to lower collision risk\nin the upstream traffic environment. In modeling the HDV dynamics in the mixed\ntraffic stream, we duly consider HDV driver heterogeneity and the time delays\nassociated with their perception reaction time. We can find that the maximum\nnumber of HDVs that a CAV can stabilize is lower when human drivers potential\ntime delay and heterogeneity are considered, compared to the scenario where\nsuch are not considered. This result suggests that heterogeneity and time delay\nin HDV behavior impairs the CAVs capability to stabilize traffic. Therefore, in\ndesigning CAV controllers for traffic stabilization, it is essential to\nconsider such uncertainty-related conditions. In our demonstration, we also\nshow that the designed controller can significantly improve both the stability\nof the mixed traffic stream and the safety of both CAVs and HDVs in the stream.\nThe results are useful for real-time calibration of the model parameters that\ncharacterize HDV movements in the mixed stream.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:31:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 19:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

We observe that,\nwhen analyzing images, human eyes often compare images against each other\ninstead of examining images individually. In addition, they often pay attention\nto certain keypoints, image regions, or objects which are discriminative\nbetween image classes but highly consistent within classes. Even if the image\nis being transformed, the attention pattern will be consistent. Motivated by\nthis observation, we develop a new approach to unsupervised deep metric\nlearning where the network is learned based on self-supervision information\nacross images instead of within one single image. To characterize the\nconsistent pattern of human attention during image comparisons, we introduce\nthe idea of transformed attention consistency. It assumes that visually similar\nimages, even undergoing different image transforms, should share the same\nconsistent visual attention map. This consistency leads to a pairwise\nself-supervision loss, allowing us to learn a Siamese deep neural network to\nencode and compare images against their transformed or matched pairs. To\nfurther enhance the inter-class discriminative power of the feature generated\nby this network, we adapt the concept of triplet loss from supervised metric\nlearning to our unsupervised case and introduce the contrastive clustering\nloss.

A prototype application involving\nthe proportional odds model demonstrates advantages of symmetric divergence\nmeasures over asymmetric measures for assessing the efficacy of features and\nfor model averaging purposes. The advantages include providing unique ranks for\nmodels and unique information weights for model averaging with one-half as much\ncomputation requirement of asymmetric divergences.

Furthermore, we also observed a two-dimensional electron gas at\nthe interface between NdNiO$_2$ and SrTiO$_3$, caused by the polar\ndiscontinuity, in agreement with recent literature. For NdNiO$_2$/SrTiO$_3$ the\ntwo-dimensional electron gas extends over several layers, while for\nCaCuO$_2$/SrTiO$_3$ this electronic rearrangement is very localized at the\ninterface between CaCuO$_2$ and SrTiO$_3$.

When a process runs out of tasks, instead of\nbeing idle, it becomes a thief to steal tasks from a victim. Thus, a\nwork-stealing algorithm provides three high-level operations: Put and Take,\nwhich can be invoked only by the owner, and Steal, which can be invoked by a\nthief. One of the main targets when designing work-stealing algorithms is to\nmake Put and Take as simple and efficient as possible. Unfortunately, it has\nbeen shown that any work-stealing algorithm in the standard asynchronous model\nmust use expensive Read- After-Write synchronization patterns or atomic\nRead-Modify-Write instructions, which may be costly in practice. Thus, prior\nresearch has proposed idempotent work-stealing, a relaxation for which there\nare algorithms with Put and Take devoid of Read-Modify-Write atomic\ninstructions and Read-After-Write synchronization patterns; however, Put uses\nfences among Write instructions, and Steal uses Compare&Swap and fences among\nRead instructions. In the TSO model, in which Write (resp. Read) instructions\ncannot be reordered, there have been proposed fully fence-free work-stealing\nalgorithms whose Put and Take have similar properties but Steal uses\nCompare&Swap or a lock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 21:30:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 18:45:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

Thermodynamic properties expected to be roughly constant\nwith doping decrease towards zero, signalling that a growing fraction of\ncarriers remain in the normal state below Tc. Near Tc, the superconducting\nenergy gap fills in with temperature, contrary to the expectations of BCS\ntheory. Most recently a transition in the Hall number of some cuprates was\nfound to extend to a very high doping (x~0.27), far beyond the pseudogap\ncritical point identified by a peak in thermodynamic properties (x=0.19). This\npresents a challenge to the view that the pseudogap is a consequence of Fermi\nsurface reconstruction. In this paper we present a consistent explanation for\nall these observations by combining pair-breaking scattering with a Fermi\nsurface reconstruction model for the pseudogap. Notably, an increase in\npair-breaking with doping leads to a separation of the points where\nreconstruction begins and the thermodynamic properties peak.

A\nnumerical solution is obtained by enclosing the system in an outer cylinder of\nradius R_0>>1, on which different boundary conditions can be imposed. With a\ngap 2epsilon between the inner cylinders, attention is focused on the small gap\nsituation epsilon<<1 when lubrication theory becomes applicable. Good agreement\nwith the numerical solution is obtained for both counter-rotating and\nco-rotating cases. In the counter-rotating situation, the total force F acting\non the cylinders is determined. Numerical evidence is presented for the\nconclusion that F~log(R_0)^-1 as R_0->infty. An exact analytic solution is\nobtained in the contact limit epsilon=0, and a contact force in F_c is\nidentified, which contributes to the torque that each cylinder experiences\nabout its axis. The far-field torque doublet is also identified. The manner in\nwhich the flow topology adapts to the change in topology of the fluid domain\nwhen the cylinders are brought into contact is noted. The sliced-cylinder\nsituation when epsilon<0 is also considered, and in this case a distributed\ncontact force is identified, and a similarity solution is found that describes\nthe flow near the corner singularities. In the case of co-rotating cylinders,\nthe theory of Watson is elucidated and shown to agree well with the numerical\nsolution and with lubrication theory when epsilon<0.01. The torque generated by\nthe co-rotation of the cylinders is determined, with asymptotic value ~17.25 as\nepsilon->0. An alternative exact analytic solution in the contact limit is\nobtained, for which the torque is zero and the far-field flow is one of uniform\nrotation; in a rotating frame of reference in which the fluid at infinity is at\nrest, the relative flow in this case is identified as a `radial quadrupole'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 22:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

A detailed understanding of the surface textures via\ntactile sensing is essential for many of these tasks. Previous works on texture\nrecognition using camera based tactile sensors have been limited to treating\nall regions in one tactile image or all samples in one tactile sequence\nequally, which includes much irrelevant or redundant information. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Attention Model (STAM) for tactile\ntexture recognition, which is the very first of its kind to our best knowledge.\nThe proposed STAM pays attention to both spatial focus of each single tactile\ntexture and the temporal correlation of a tactile sequence. In the experiments\nto discriminate 100 different fabric textures, the spatially and temporally\nselective attention has resulted in a significant improvement of the\nrecognition accuracy, by up to 18.8%, compared to the non-attention based\nmodels. Specifically, after introducing noisy data that is collected before the\ncontact happens, our proposed STAM can learn the salient features efficiently\nand the accuracy can increase by 15.23% on average compared with the CNN based\nbaseline approach. The improved tactile texture perception can be applied to\nfacilitate robot tasks like grasping and manipulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 22:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

QR with Column Pivoting (QRCP) is\nusually suitable for these purposes, but it can be much slower than the\nunpivoted QR algorithm. For large matrices, the difference in performance is\ndue to increased communication between the processor and slow memory, which\nQRCP needs in order to choose pivots during decomposition. Our main algorithm,\nRandomized QR with Column Pivoting (RQRCP), uses randomized projection to make\npivot decisions from a much smaller sample matrix, which we can construct to\nreside in a faster level of memory than the original matrix. This technique may\nbe understood as trading vastly reduced communication for a controlled increase\nin uncertainty during the decision process. For rank-revealing purposes, the\nselection mechanism in RQRCP produces results that are the same quality as the\nstandard algorithm, but with performance near that of unpivoted QR (often an\norder of magnitude faster for large matrices). We also propose two formulas\nthat facilitate further performance improvements. The first efficiently updates\nsample matrices to avoid computing new randomized projections. The second\navoids large trailing updates during the decomposition in truncated low-rank\napproximations. Our truncated version of RQRCP also provides a key initial step\nin our truncated SVD approximation, TUXV.

One direction is to\nexplore the usage of sharding in which we partition the managed dataset over\nmany shards that independently operate as blockchains. Sharding requires an\nefficient fault-tolerant primitive for the ordering and execution of\nmulti-shard transactions, however.\n  In this work, we seek to design such a primitive suitable for distributed\nledger networks with high transaction throughput. To do so, we propose\nCerberus, a set of minimalistic primitives for processing single-shard and\nmulti-shard UTXO-like transactions. Cerberus aims at maximizing parallel\nprocessing at shards while minimizing coordination within and between shards.\nFirst, we propose Core-Cerberus, that uses strict environmental requirements to\nenable simple yet powerful multi-shard transaction processing.

Yet, human grasps are still difficult to synthesize realistically. There\nare several key reasons: (1) the human hand has many degrees of freedom (more\nthan robotic manipulators); (2) the synthesized hand should conform to the\nsurface of the object; and (3) it should interact with the object in a\nsemantically and physically plausible manner. To make progress in this\ndirection, we draw inspiration from the recent progress on learning-based\nimplicit representations for 3D object reconstruction. Specifically, we propose\nan expressive representation for human grasp modelling that is efficient and\neasy to integrate with deep neural networks. Our insight is that every point in\na three-dimensional space can be characterized by the signed distances to the\nsurface of the hand and the object, respectively. Consequently, the hand, the\nobject, and the contact area can be represented by implicit surfaces in a\ncommon space, in which the proximity between the hand and the object can be\nmodelled explicitly. We name this 3D to 2D mapping as Grasping Field,\nparameterize it with a deep neural network, and learn it from data. We\ndemonstrate that the proposed grasping field is an effective and expressive\nrepresentation for human grasp generation.

The extensive experiments demonstrate that our generative model\ncompares favorably with a strong baseline and approaches the level of natural\nhuman grasps.

Given object models, one approach is to\nperform object pose estimation and use the most likely candidate pose per\nobject to pick the target without collisions. This approach, however, ignores\nthe uncertainty of the perception process both regarding the target's and the\nsurrounding objects' poses. This work proposes first a perception process for\n6D pose estimation, which returns a discrete distribution of object poses in a\nscene. Then, an open-loop planning pipeline is proposed to return safe and\neffective solutions for moving a robotic arm to pick, which (a) minimizes the\nprobability of collision with the obstructing objects; and (b) maximizes the\nprobability of reaching the target item. The planning framework models the\nchallenge as a stochastic variant of the Minimum Constraint Removal (MCR)\nproblem. The effectiveness of the methodology is verified given both simulated\nand real data in different scenarios.

The strategy is to\nmatch an interior regular solution to an exterior electrovacuum solution. With\nthis purpose, we first write explicitly the Einstein field equations for the\ninterior regular region. We take an electrically charged nonisotropic fluid,\nwhich presents spherical symmetry and a de Sitter type equation of state, where\nthe radial pressure $p_r$ is equal to the negative of energy density $\\rho$,\n$p_r=-\\rho$. Then, two solutions for the Einstein equations are built, a\nregular interior solution for the region with matter satisfying a de Sitter\nequation of state, and an external solution for the region outside the matter,\nthat corresponds to the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om metric. To complete the solution\nwe apply the Darmois-Israel junction conditions with a timelike thin shell at\nthe matching surface. It is assumed that the matching surface is composed by a\nthin shell of matter, i.e., a surface layer in the form a perfect fluid obeying\na barotropic equation of state, $\\mathcal{P}=\\omega\\sigma$, $P$ and $\\sigma $\nbeing the intrinsic pressure and energy density of the shell, respectively, and\n$\\omega$ a constant parameter.

However, dynamic\ninstances of these code regions, called transactions, may fail to behave\natomically, resulting in transactional atomicity violations. Existing dynamic\nonline atomicity checkers incur either false positives or false negatives in\ndetecting transactions experiencing transactional atomicity violations. This\npaper proposes RegionTrack. RegionTrack tracks cross-thread dependences at the\nevent, dynamic subregion, and transaction levels. It maintains both dynamic\nsubregions within selected transactions and transactional happens-before\nrelations through its novel timestamp propagation approach. We prove that\nRegionTrack is sound and complete in detecting both transactional atomicity\nviolations and non-serializable traces.

For example, intracellular\ncargo is transported on tubular networks, news and rumors spread through online\nsocial networks, and the rapid global spread of infectious diseases occurs\nthrough passengers traveling on the airport network. To understand the\ntimescale of search/transport/spread, one commonly studies the first passage\ntime (FPT) of a single searcher (or ``spreader'') to a target. However, in many\nscenarios the relevant timescale is not the FPT of a single searcher to a\ntarget, but rather the FPT of the fastest searcher to a target out of many\nsearchers. For example, many processes in cell biology are triggered by the\nfirst molecule to find a target out of many, and the time it takes an\ninfectious disease to reach a particular city depends on the first infected\ntraveler to arrive out of potentially many infected travelers. Such fastest\nFPTs are called extreme FPTs. In this paper, we study extreme FPTs for a\ngeneral class of continuous-time random walks on networks (which includes\ncontinuous-time Markov chains). In the limit of many searchers, we find\nexplicit formulas for the probability distribution and all the moments of the\n$k$th fastest FPT. These rigorous formulas depend only on network parameters\nalong a certain geodesic path(s) from the starting location to the target since\nthe fastest searchers take a direct route to the target. Furthermore, our\nresults allow one to estimate if a particular system is in a regime\ncharacterized by fast extreme FPTs.

We illustrate our results with numerical simulations and\nuncover potential pitfalls of modeling diffusive or subdiffusive processes\ninvolving extreme statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 03:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

In the iterations of ADMM,\nmodel updates using local private data and model exchanges among agents impose\ncritical privacy concerns. Despite some pioneering works to relieve such\nconcerns, differentially private ADMM still confronts many research challenges.\nFor example, the guarantee of differential privacy (DP) relies on the premise\nthat the optimality of each local problem can be perfectly attained in each\nADMM iteration, which may never happen in practice. The model trained by DP\nADMM may have low prediction accuracy. In this paper, we address these concerns\nby proposing a novel (Improved) Plausible differentially Private ADMM\nalgorithm, called PP-ADMM and IPP-ADMM. In PP-ADMM, each agent approximately\nsolves a perturbed optimization problem that is formulated from its local\nprivate data in an iteration, and then perturbs the approximate solution with\nGaussian noise to provide the DP guarantee. To further improve the model\naccuracy and convergence, an improved version IPP-ADMM adopts sparse vector\ntechnique (SVT) to determine if an agent should update its neighbors with the\ncurrent perturbed solution. The agent calculates the difference of the current\nsolution from that in the last iteration, and if the difference is larger than\na threshold, it passes the solution to neighbors; or otherwise the solution\nwill be discarded. Moreover, we propose to track the total privacy loss under\nthe zero-concentrated DP (zCDP) and provide a generalization performance\nanalysis. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that under the same\nprivacy guarantee, the proposed algorithms are superior to the state of the art\nin terms of model accuracy and convergence rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 03:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

Models for plasma response to RMP are commonly\ncomposed of equations for the resonant magnetic field response (i.e. the\nmagnetic island) and the torque balance of plasma flow. However, in previous\nplasma response models, the magnetic island and the torque balance equations\nare often derived separately from reduced MHD and full MHD equations,\nrespectively. By contrast, in this work we derive both the magnetic island\nresponse and the torque balance equations in a quasi-linear model for plasma\nflow response entirely from a set of two-field reduced MHD equations. Such a\nquasi-linear model can recover previous plasma flow response models within\ncertain limits and approximations. Furthermore, the physical origins of\nquasi-linear forces and moments in the flow response equation are also\naccurately calculated and clarified self-consistently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 05:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Despite its industrial importance, the reaction\nmechanism of HPDS is still controversial, even for the prototypical catalyst\nPd. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a comprehensive\nconsideration of entropic and solvation effects reveal that the conventionally\naccepted Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism fails to explain why H2O2 production\ndominates over H2O production, which was experimentally reported. Inspired by\nthe recently suggested heterolytic mechanism that involves electron and proton\ntransfer at Pd catalysts, we propose a new electrochemical DFT model that is\napplicable for nonelectrochemical systems where a protonation intrinsically\noccurs. Our model is based on combining the Butler-Volmer equation and constant\npotential DFT with hybrid explicit-implicit solvent treatments. Application of\nthis model to Pd(111) surfaces produces accurate descriptions of the activation\nbarriers of both H2O2 and H2O production (within only ~0.1 eV of experimentally\nmeasured values). The heterolytic mechanism has a lower barrier for the\nprotonation steps for H2O2 production than the nonelectrochemical hydrogenation\nsteps, leading to advantageous kinetics for H2O2 production over H2O\nproduction. This work is the first theoretical and computational study\nsupporting the heterolytic H2O2 production mechanism, and it resolves the\nunanswered discrepancies between previous experimental and DFT results.

Hence, removing the thick\ncloud and cloud shadow as well as recovering the cloud-contaminated pixels is\nindispensable to make good use of remote sensing images. In this paper, a novel\nthick cloud removal method for remote sensing images based on temporal\nsmoothness and sparsity-regularized tensor optimization (TSSTO) is proposed.\nThe basic idea of TSSTO is that the thick cloud and cloud shadow are not only\nsparse but also smooth along the horizontal and vertical direction in images\nwhile the clean images are smooth along the temporal direction between images.\nTherefore, the sparsity norm is used to boost the sparsity of the cloud and\ncloud shadow, and unidirectional total variation (UTV) regularizers are applied\nto ensure the unidirectional smoothness. This paper utilizes alternation\ndirection method of multipliers to solve the presented model and generate the\ncloud and cloud shadow element as well as the clean element.

The benefits of automated contact tracing are two-fold.\nContact tracing promises to reduce the number of infections by being able to:\n1) systematically identify all of those that have been in contact with someone\nwho has had COVID; and, 2) ensure those that have been exposed to the virus do\nnot unknowingly infect others. \"COVI\" is the name of a recent contact tracing\napp developed by Mila and was proposed to help combat COVID-19 in Canada. The\napp was designed to inform each individual of their relative risk of being\ninfected with the virus, which Mila claimed would empower citizens to make\ninformed decisions about their movement and allow for a data-driven approach to\npublic health policy; all the while ensuring data is safeguarded from\ngovernments, companies, and individuals. This article will provide a critical\nresponse to Mila's COVI White Paper. Specifically, this article will discuss:\nthe extent to which diversity has been considered in the design of the app,\nassumptions surrounding users' interaction with the app and the app's utility,\nas well as unanswered questions surrounding transparency, accountability, and\nsecurity. We see this as an opportunity to supplement the excellent risk\nanalysis done by the COVI team to surface insights that can be applied to other\ncontact- and proximity-tracing apps that are being developed and deployed\nacross the world.

It also serves as a fundamental step towards multi-hop\nreasoning over learned knowledge. Previously, several rotation-based\ntranslational methods have been developed to model composite relations using\nthe product of a series of complex-valued diagonal matrices. However, these\nmethods tend to make several oversimplified assumptions on the composite\nrelations, e.g., forcing them to be commutative, independent from entities and\nlacking semantic hierarchy. To systematically tackle these problems, we have\ndeveloped a novel knowledge graph embedding method, named DensE, to provide an\nimproved modeling scheme for the complex composition patterns of relations. In\nparticular, our method decomposes each relation into an SO(3) group-based\nrotation operator and a scaling operator in the three dimensional (3-D)\nEuclidean space. This design principle leads to several advantages of our\nmethod: (1) For composite relations, the corresponding diagonal relation\nmatrices can be non-commutative, reflecting a predominant scenario in real\nworld applications; (2) Our model preserves the natural interaction between\nrelational operations and entity embeddings; (3) The scaling operation provides\nthe modeling power for the intrinsic semantic hierarchical structure of\nentities; (4) The enhanced expressiveness of DensE is achieved with high\ncomputational efficiency in terms of both parameter size and training time; and\n(5) Modeling entities in Euclidean space instead of quaternion space keeps the\ndirect geometrical interpretations of relational patterns. Experimental results\non multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DensE outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-art models for missing link prediction, especially on composite\nrelations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 06:45:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 04:18:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

While this allows for a conceptual re-use of methods, it\nrequires novel implementations for every new technique.\n  In this paper, we employ cooperative verification in order to avoid\nreimplementation and enable usage of novel tools as black-box components in\nverification. Specifically, cooperation is employed for the core ingredient of\nsoftware verification which is invariant generation. Finding an adequate loop\ninvariant is key to the success of a verification run. Our framework named\nCoVerCIG allows a master verification tool to delegate the task of invariant\ngeneration to one or several specialized helper invariant generators.

Many\napplications depend on matrix decomposition algorithms that provide accurate\nlow-rank representations of data. In modern problems, however, various factors\nmake this hard to accomplish. One solution to these problems is the use of\nrandom projections. Instead of directly computing the matrix factorization, we\nrandomly project the matrix onto a lower-dimensional subspace and then compute\nthe factorization. Often, we are able to do this without significant loss of\naccuracy. We describe how randomization can be used to create more efficient\nalgorithms to perform low-rank matrix approximation, as well as introducing a\nnovel randomized algorithm for matrix decomposition. Compared to standard\napproaches, random algorithms are often faster and more robust. With these\nrandomized algorithms, analyzing massive data sets becomes tractable.\n  Kernel methods are almost diametrically opposite from low-rank approximation.\nThe idea is to project low-dimensional data into a higher-dimensional 'feature\nspace,' such that it is linear separable in the feature space. This enables the\nmodel to learn a nonlinear separation of the data. As before, with large data\nmatrices, computing the kernel matrix can be expensive, so we use randomized\nmethods to approximate the matrix. In addition, we propose an extension of the\nrandom Fourier features kernel in which hyperparameter values are randomly\nsampled from an interval or Borel set.\n  The experiments discussed in this paper can be found on our website at\nhttps://rishi1999.github.io/random-projections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 07:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

To bring out the power of regularization,\nsophisticated layered modeling of mixed norms that can capture inherent signal\nstructure is a key ingredient, but the proximity operator of such a mixed norm\nis often unavailable (non-proximable).

The approach relies on using empirical information\nembedded in trajectories in order to infer, and then to solve, a so-called\nconditioning problem for some generating collection of polytopes. A\nconditioning problem consists of a series of requirements on the polytopes'\nlocalisation and on the dynamical transitions between these elements. The core\nelement of the approach is a reformulation of the problem as a set of piecewise\nlinear inequalities for some matrices which encapsulate geometric constraints.\nIn that way, the original topological puzzle is converted into a standard\nproblem in computational geometry. This transformation involves an optimization\nprocedure that ensures that both problems are equivalent.\n  As a proof of concept, the approach is applied to the study of the loss of\nergodicity in basic examples of globally coupled maps.

These special characteristics of model inference open new\nopportunities for its optimization. In this paper, we propose a hardware-aware\noptimization framework, namely Woodpecker-DL (WPK), to accelerate inference by\ntaking advantage of multiple joint optimizations from the perspectives of graph\noptimization, automated searches, domain-specific language (DSL) compiler\ntechniques and system-level exploration.

Existing methods are mostly designed for single-frame\ndetection trained with precise image-level labels or for video-level prediction\nby only modeling the inter-frame inconsistency, leaving potential high risks\nfor DeepFake attackers. In this paper, we introduce a new problem of partial\nface attack in DeepFake video, where only video-level labels are provided but\nnot all the faces in the fake videos are manipulated. We address this problem\nby multiple instance learning framework, treating faces and input video as\ninstances and bag respectively. A sharp MIL (S-MIL) is proposed which builds\ndirect mapping from instance embeddings to bag prediction, rather than from\ninstance embeddings to instance prediction and then to bag prediction in\ntraditional MIL. Theoretical analysis proves that the gradient vanishing in\ntraditional MIL is relieved in S-MIL. To generate instances that can accurately\nincorporate the partially manipulated faces, spatial-temporal encoded instance\nis designed to fully model the intra-frame and inter-frame inconsistency, which\nfurther helps to promote the detection performance. We also construct a new\ndataset FFPMS for partially attacked DeepFake video detection, which can\nbenefit the evaluation of different methods at both frame and video levels.\nExperiments on FFPMS and the widely used DFDC dataset verify that S-MIL is\nsuperior to other counterparts for partially attacked DeepFake video detection.\nIn addition, S-MIL can also be adapted to traditional DeepFake image detection\ntasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance on single-frame datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 08:52:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

In the presence of uncertainty, accurate prediction of the\nbehavior of these systems using the models requires understanding the effect of\nuncertainty in the response. In uncertainty quantification, statistics such as\nmean and variance of the response of these physical systems are sought. To\nestimate these statistics sampling-based methods like Monte Carlo often require\nmany evaluations of the models' governing equations for multiple realizations\nof the uncertainty. However, for large complex engineering systems, these\nmethods become computationally burdensome. In structural engineering, often an\notherwise linear structure contains spatially local nonlinearities with\nuncertainty present in them. A standard nonlinear solver for them with\nsampling-based methods for uncertainty quantification incurs significant\ncomputational cost for estimating the statistics of the response. To ease this\ncomputational burden of uncertainty quantification of large-scale locally\nnonlinear dynamical systems, a method is proposed herein, which decomposes the\nresponse into two parts -- response of a nominal linear system and a corrective\nterm. This corrective term is the response from a pseudoforce that contains the\nnonlinearity and uncertainty information.

This makes it more effective\nat discarding Byzantine workers inputs than existing methods that eliminate\noutliers in the parameter-space of the learned model. HoldOut SGD first\nrandomly selects a set of workers that use their private data in order to\npropose gradient updates. Next, a voting committee of workers is randomly\nselected, and each voter uses its private data as holdout data, in order to\nselect the best proposals via a voting scheme.

We consider a\nscenario in which the initially neutral particles on regular geodesic orbits in\nthe equatorial plane are destabilized by a charging process (e.g., by\nphotoionization).

This architecture is inspired by the next sentence prediction\ntask of bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT), and we\nfeed the s-vectors of two utterances to verify whether they belong to the same\nspeaker. We name this architecture the Transformer encoder speaker\nauthenticator (TESA). Our experiments show that the performance of s-vectors\nwith TESA is better than s-vectors with conventional PLDA-based speaker\nverification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 12:23:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 2021 09:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

The\ncontribution to GCE from super asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars (with\nM~8-10M_\\odot at solar metallicity) is negligible, unless hybrid white dwarfs\nfrom low-mass super-AGB stars explode as so-called Type Iax supernovae, or\nhigh-mass super-AGB stars explode as electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe).

Traditional OSC methods usually\ntrain discriminative or generative models with in-class data, then utilize the\npre-trained models to classify test data directly. However, these methods\nalways suffer from embedding confusion problem, i.e., partial out-of-class\ninstances are mixed with in-class ones of similar semantics, making it\ndifficult to classify. To solve this problem, we unify semi-supervised learning\nto develop a novel OSC algorithm, S2OSC, that incorporates out-of-class\ninstances filtering and model re-training in a transductive manner. In detail,\ngiven a pool of newly coming test data, S2OSC firstly filters distinct\nout-of-class instances using the pre-trained model, and annotates super-class\nfor them. Then, S2OSC trains a holistic classification model by combing\nin-class and out-of-class labeled data and remaining unlabeled test data in\nsemi-supervised paradigm, which also integrates pre-trained model for knowledge\ndistillation to further separate mixed instances. Despite its simplicity, the\nexperimental results show that S2OSC achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross a variety of OSC tasks, including 85.4% of F1 on CIFAR-10 with only 300\npseudo-labels. We also demonstrate how S2OSC can be expanded to incremental OSC\nsetting effectively with streaming data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 12:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

The optical flow estimator\nis applied on a sequence of images taken along an angular dimension of the\nlight field, which produces several disparity map estimates. Considering both\naccuracy and efficiency, we choose the feature flow method as our optical flow\nestimator. Thanks to its spatio-temporal edge-aware filtering properties, the\ndifferent disparity map estimates that we obtain are very consistent, which\nallows a fast and simple aggregation step to create a single disparity map,\nwhich can then converted into a depth map. Since the disparity map estimates\nare consistent, we can also create a depth map from each disparity estimate,\nand then aggregate the different depth maps in the 3D space to create a single\ndense depth map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 12:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

For instance, rebuffering during key moments of a sports\nvideo (e.g., before a goal is scored) is more annoying than rebuffering during\nnormal gameplay. Such dynamic quality sensitivity, however, is rarely captured\nby current approaches, which predict QoE (quality-of-experience) using\none-size-fits-all heuristics that are too simplistic to understand the nuances\nof video content. Instead of proposing yet another heuristic, we take a\ndifferent approach: we run a separate crowdsourcing experiment for each video\nto derive users' quality sensitivity at different parts of the video. Of\ncourse, the cost of doing this at scale can be prohibitive, but we show that\ncareful experiment design combined with a suite of pruning techniques can make\nthe cost negligible compared to how much content providers invest in content\ngeneration and distribution. Our ability to accurately profile time-varying\nuser sensitivity inspires a new approach: dynamically aligning higher (lower)\nquality with higher (lower) sensitivity periods. We present a new video\nstreaming system called SENSEI that incorporates dynamic quality sensitivity\ninto existing quality adaptation algorithms. We apply SENSEI to two\nstate-of-the-art adaptation algorithms. SENSEI can take seemingly unusual\nactions: e.g., lowering bitrate (or initiating a rebuffering event) even when\nbandwidth is sufficient so that it can maintain a higher bitrate without\nrebuffering when quality sensitivity becomes higher in the near future.\nCompared to state-of-the-art approaches, SENSEI improves QoE by 15.1% or\nachieves the same QoE with 26.8% less bandwidth on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 13:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

The goal is to get a\nbetter understanding of how information gaining for subsurface imaging works\nand how the spatial resolution limit can be overcome by using additional\ninformation. Here, the resolution limit in photoacoustic and photothermal\nimaging is derived from the irreversibility of attenuation of the pressure wave\nand of heat diffusion during propagation of the signals from the imaged\nsubsurface structures to the sample surface, respectively. The acoustic or\ntemperature signals are converted into so-called virtual waves, which are their\nreversible counterparts and which can be used for image reconstruction by\nwell-known ultrasound reconstruction methods. The conversion into virtual waves\nis an ill-posed inverse problem which needs regularization. The reason for that\nis the information loss during signal propagation to the sample surface, which\nturns out to be equal to the entropy production. As the entropy production from\nacoustic attenuation is usually small compared to the entropy production from\nheat diffusion, the spatial resolution in acoustic imaging is higher than in\nthermal imaging. Therefore, it is especially necessary to overcome this\nresolution limit for thermographic imaging by using additional information.\nIncorporating sparsity and non-negativity in iterative regularization methods\ngives a significant resolution enhancement, which was experimentally\ndemonstrated by one-dimensional imaging of thin layers with varying depth or by\nthree-dimensional imaging, either from a single detection plane or from three\nperpendicular detection planes on the surface of a sample cube.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 13:36:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 06:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Yet, the interrelations between the singularity\norder, lengthscale separation and edge-localized energy balance in frictional\nrupture are not fully understood, even in physical situations in which the\nconventional square root singularity remains approximately valid. Here we\ndevelop a macroscopic theory that shows that the generic rate-dependent nature\nof friction leads to deviations from the conventional singularity, and that\neven if this deviation is small, significant non-edge-localized rupture-related\ndissipation emerges. The physical origin of the latter, which is predicted to\nvanish identically in the crack analogy, is the breakdown of scale separation\nthat leads an accumulated spatially-extended dissipation, involving macroscopic\nscales.

In this work we attempt to apply this model for the first time\nto a Neutron Star (NS) LMXB, i.e. 4U 0614+091. We used the multi-wavelength\ndata set obtained in 2006, comprising data from radio to X-ray, and applied a\nmodel which includes an irradiated disc model for the accretion flow and an\nupdated version of the internal shocks code for the ejection. The new version\nof the code allows to change the geometry of the jet for the case of\nnon-conical jets. Only two alternative scenarios provide a satisfactory\ndescription of the data: using the X-ray PDS but in a non-conical geometry for\nthe jet, or either using a conical geometry but with a \"flicker-noise\" PDS.\nBoth scenarios would imply some differences with the results obtained with\nsimilar models on BH X-ray binaries, shedding light on the possibility that\njets in NS and BH binaries might somehow have a different geometry or a\ndifferent coupling with the accretion flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 14:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

Interpretation of our model is that the intrinsic citation\ncapacity, and hence the initial visibility of a paper, will be enhanced when\nmore people are intimately familiar with some work, favoring papers from larger\nteams. While the intrinsic citation capacity cannot depend only on the team\nsize, our model demonstrates that it must be to some degree correlated with it,\nand distributed in a similar way, i.e., having a power-law tail.

This paper aims to address some of these questions by\nfocusing on the key types of data which are used by cyber-insurance\npractitioners, particularly for decision-making in the insurance underwriting\nand claim processes. We further explore practitioners' perceptions of the\nchallenges they face in gathering and using data, and identify gaps where\nfurther data is required. We draw our conclusions from a qualitative study by\nconducting a focus group with a range of cyber-insurance professionals\n(including underwriters, actuaries, claims specialists, breach responders, and\ncyber operations specialists) and provide valuable contributions to existing\nknowledge. These insights include examples of key data types which contribute\nto the calculation of premiums and decisions on claims, the identification of\nchallenges and gaps at various stages of data gathering, and initial\nperspectives on the development of a pre-competitive dataset for the cyber\ninsurance industry. We believe an improved understanding of data gathering and\nusage in cyber insurance, and of the current challenges faced, can be\ninvaluable for informing future research and practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 14:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

The automatic segmentation is however still\nchallenging, due to the poor image quality, the various LA shapes, the thin\nwall, and the surrounding enhanced regions. Previous methods normally solved\nthe two tasks independently and ignored the intrinsic spatial relationship\nbetween LA and scars. In this work, we develop a new framework, namely\nAtrialJSQnet, where LA segmentation, scar projection onto the LA surface, and\nscar quantification are performed simultaneously in an end-to-end style. We\npropose a mechanism of shape attention (SA) via an explicit surface projection,\nto utilize the inherent correlation between LA and LA scars.

Before that this effect\nbe investigated, it is important to determine how wide and frequent the\ndiscrepancy between observed and N-body predicted profiles is and what its\nfeatures are. We used more than 3200 quite extended rotation curves (RCs) of\ngood quality and high resolution of disk systems. The curves cover all\nmagnitude ranges. These RCs were condensed into 26 coadded RCs, each of them\nbuilt with individual RCs of galaxies of similar luminosity and morphology. We\nperformed mass models of these 26 RCs using the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)\nprofile for the contribution of the DM halo to the circular velocity and the\nexponential Freeman disk for that of the stellar disk.

Firstly, the pseudo labels are\ngenerated using the model's prediction on the augmented set of unlabelled image\nwith averaging. The high entropy predictions are further sharpened to reduced\nthe entropy and are then mixed with the labelled set for training. The model is\ntrained in multi-task learning manner with noise tolerant joint loss for\nclassification localization and achieves better performance when given limited\ndata in contrast to a simple deep model. On DLBCL data it achieves 80\\%\naccuracy in contrast to simple CNN achieving 70\\% accuracy when given only 100\nlabelled examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 15:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

On short timescales, super-spreading events lead to\nburstiness and overdispersion, while long-term persistent heterogeneity in\nsusceptibility is expected to lead to a reduction in the infection peak and the\nherd immunity threshold (HIT). Here, we develop a general approach to encompass\nboth timescales, including time variations in individual social activity, and\ndemonstrate how to incorporate them phenomenologically into a wide class of\nepidemiological models through parameterization. We derive a non-linear\ndependence of the effective reproduction number Re on the susceptible\npopulation fraction S. We show that a state of transient collective immunity\n(TCI) emerges well below the HIT during early, high-paced stages of the\nepidemic. However, this is a fragile state that wanes over time due to changing\nlevels of social activity, and so the infection peak is not an indication of\nherd immunity: subsequent waves can and will emerge due to behavioral changes\nin the population, driven (e.g.) by seasonal factors. Transient and long-term\nlevels of heterogeneity are estimated by using empirical data from the COVID-19\nepidemic as well as from real-life face-to-face contact networks. These results\nsuggest that the hardest-hit areas, such as NYC, have achieved TCI following\nthe first wave of the epidemic, but likely remain below the long-term HIT.\nThus, in contrast to some previous claims, these regions can still experience\nsubsequent waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:40:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 17:41:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}
