We tackle the problem of\npredicting information cascades by presenting a novel variant of SEIZ\n(Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infected/ Skeptics) model that outperforms the original\nversion by taking into account the cognitive processing depth of users. We\ndefine an information cascade as the set of social media users' reactions to\nthe original content which requires at least minimal physical and cognitive\neffort; therefore, we considered retweet/ reply/ quote (mention) activities and\ntested our framework on the Syrian White Helmets Twitter data set from April\n1st, 2018 to April 30th, 2019. In the prediction of cascade pattern via\ntraditional compartmental models, all the activities are grouped, and their\nsummation is taken into account; however, transition rates between compartments\nshould vary according to the activity type since their requirements of physical\nand cognitive efforts are not same. Based on this assumption, we design a\ncognition-driven SEIZ (CD-SEIZ) model in the prediction of information cascades\non Twitter. We tested SIS, SEIZ, and CD-SEIZ models on 1000 Twitter cascades\nand found that CD-SEIZ has a significantly low fitting error and provides a\nstatistically more accurate estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

In this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware self-attention\nmodel for Knowledge Tracing (RKT). We introduce a relation-aware self-attention\nlayer that incorporates the contextual information. This contextual information\nintegrates both the exercise relation information through their textual content\nas well as student performance data and the forget behavior information through\nmodeling an exponentially decaying kernel function. Extensive experiments on\nthree real-world datasets, among which two new collections are released to the\npublic, show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge tracing\nmethods. Furthermore, the interpretable attention weights help visualize the\nrelation between interactions and temporal patterns in the human learning\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:47:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a novel FPGA-based\nDNN accelerator design paradigm and its automation tool, called DNNExplorer, to\nenable fast exploration of various accelerator designs under the proposed\nparadigm and deliver optimized accelerator architectures for existing and\nemerging DNN networks. Three key techniques are essential for DNNExplorer's\nimproved performance, better specificity, and scalability, including (1) a\nunique accelerator design paradigm with both high-dimensional design space\nsupport and fine-grained adjustability, (2) a dynamic design space to\naccommodate different combinations of DNN workloads and targeted FPGAs, and (3)\na design space exploration (DSE) engine to generate optimized accelerator\narchitectures following the proposed paradigm by simultaneously considering\nboth FPGAs' computation and memory resources and DNN networks' layer-wise\ncharacteristics and overall complexity.

Because density makes R0 a decreasing function of\nthe process extent, the infection curves are different and smaller than for the\nstandard SIR model.

However, the wide bandgap\nand band alignment of magnesium oxide-iron systems increases the\nresistance-area product and causes challenges of device-to-device variability\nand tunnel barrier degradation under high current. Here, we study using first\nprinciples narrower-bandgap scandium nitride tunneling properties and transport\nin magnetic tunnel junctions in comparison to magnesium oxide.

Here, we propose a protocol to\nparallelize the implementation of two-qubit entangling gates between multiple\nusers which are spatially separated, and use a commonly shared spin chain\ndata-bus. Our protocol works through inducing effective interaction between\neach pair of qubits without disturbing the others, therefore, it increases the\nrate of gate operations without creating crosstalk. This is achieved by tuning\nthe Hamiltonian parameters appropriately, described in the form of two\ndifferent strategies. The tuning of the parameters makes different bilocalized\neigenstates responsible for the realization of the entangling gates between\ndifferent pairs of distant qubits. Remarkably, the performance of our protocol\nis robust against increasing the length of the data-bus and the number of\nusers. Moreover, we show that this protocol can tolerate various types of\ndisorders and is applicable in the context of superconductor-based systems. The\nproposed protocol can serve for realizing two-way quantum communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 17:50:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 03:22:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 08:21:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 01:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Among the\nmost interesting objects in GCs are the cataclysmic variables (CVs), which are\ninteracting binaries harboring a white dwarf accreting from a low-mass\ncompanion. Since GC densities are sufficiently high that dynamical encounters\ninvolving binaries should be common, CV progenitors are expected to be affected\nby dynamics in some way in the early stages. In this article we review the\nformation channels and the influence of dynamics on the CV population in GCs.\nIn particular, we review recent progress in numerical simulations. Furthermore,\nwe discuss observational properties of CVs in GCs and the techniques used to\nidentify and study them. We focus the discussion on the multi-wavelength\nobservations carried out with HST and Chandra on the best-studied GCs NGC 6397,\nNGC 6752, 47 Tucanae and Omega Centauri; on the recent spectroscopic findings\nwith MUSE, and on updates regarding the correlation between the number of faint\nX-ray sources and the cluster stellar encounter rate.

Making the connection to Lyman alpha\nemission, we find that the observed extended surface brightness profile is due\nto a combination of three components: scattering of galactic Lyman alpha\nemission in the CGM, in-situ emission of CGM gas (mostly infalling), and Lyman\nalpha emission from small satellite galaxies. The weight of these contributions\nvary with distance from the galaxy such that (1) scattering dominates the inner\nregions (r < 7 kpc), at surface brightness larger than a few 10^-19 cgs, (2)\nall components contribute equally around r ~ 10 kpc (or SB ~10^-19), and (3)\nthe contribution of small satellite galaxies takes over at large distances (or\nSB ~10^-20). Our simulation fails to reproduce the characteristic observed\nLyman alpha spectral morphology that is red-shifted with respect to the\nsystemic velocity, with the implication that the simulation is missing an\nimportant component of neutral outflowing gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 09:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

It aims at quantifying the benefits\nof autonomous vehicles for community-based trip sharing, compared to a\ncar-pooling platform where vehicles are driven by their owners. In the\nconsidered problem, each rider specifies a desired arrival time for her inbound\ntrip (commuting to work) and a departure time for her outbound trip (commuting\nback home). In addition, her commute time cannot deviate too much from the\nduration of a direct trip. Prior work motivated by reducing parking pressure\nand congestion in the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, showed that a car-pooling\nplatform for community-based trip sharing could reduce the number of vehicles\nby close to 60%.\n  This paper studies the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles in further\nreducing the number of vehicles needed to serve all these commuting trips. It\nproposes a column-generation procedure that generates and assembles mini routes\nto serve inbound and outbound trips, using a lexicographic objective that first\nminimizes the required vehicle count and then the total travel distance. The\noptimization algorithm is evaluated on a large-scale, real-world dataset of\ncommute trips from the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan. The results of the\noptimization show that it can leverage autonomous vehicles to reduce the daily\nvehicle usage by 92%, improving upon the results of the original Commute Trip\nSharing Problem by 34%, while also reducing daily vehicle miles traveled by\napproximately 30%.

While API deprecation analysis as a theme is not new, most existing\nwork focuses on non-web APIs, such as the ones provided by Java and Android. To\ninvestigate RESTful API deprecation, we propose a framework called RADA\n(RESTful API Deprecation Analyzer).

For\nnon-precessing, circular binaries dominated by quadrupole radiation these phase\nshifts are degenerate with either a shift in the coalescence phase or a\ndetector and inclination dependent shift in the orientation angle. This\ndegeneracy is broken by the presence of higher harmonic modes with $|m|\\ne 2$\nin the former and $|m| \\ne l$ in the latter. Precession or eccentricity will\nalso break this degeneracy. This implies that lensed GWs will not necessarily\nbe consistent with (unlensed) predictions from general relativity (GR).\nTherefore, unlike EM lensing, GW SL can lead to images with an observable\nmodified phase evolution. However, for a wide parameter space, the lensed\nwaveform is similar enough to an unlensed waveform that detection pipelines\nwill still find it. For present detectors, templates with a shifted\ndetector-dependent orientation angle have SNR differences of less than $1\\%$\nfor mass ratios up to 0.1, and less than $5\\%$ for precession parameters up to\n0.5 and eccentricities up to 0.4 at 20Hz. The mismatch is lower than $10\\%$\nwith the alternative detector-independent coalescence phase shift. Nonetheless,\nfor a loud enough source, even with one image it may be possible to directly\nidentify it as a SL image from its non-GR waveform. In more extreme cases,\nlensing may lead to considerable distortions, and the lensed GWs may be\nundetected with current searches. Nevertheless, an exact template with a phase\nshift in Fourier space can always be constructed to fit any lensed GW. We\nconclude that an optimal search strategy would incorporate phase information in\nall stages, with an exact treatment in the final assessment of the probability\nof multiple lensed events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 18:58:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 03:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

For domain\ngeneralization, the goal is to learn from a set of source domains to produce a\nsingle model that will best generalize to an unseen target domain. As such,\nmany prior approaches focus on learning representations which persist across\nall source domains with the assumption that these domain agnostic\nrepresentations will generalize well. However, often individual domains contain\ncharacteristics which are unique and when leveraged can significantly aid\nin-domain recognition performance. To produce a model which best generalizes to\nboth seen and unseen domains, we propose learning domain specific masks. The\nmasks are encouraged to learn a balance of domain-invariant and domain-specific\nfeatures, thus enabling a model which can benefit from the predictive power of\nspecialized features while retaining the universal applicability of\ndomain-invariant features.

Recently, multiple LPWAN technologies have been developed\nthat operate in the licensed (e.g., 5G) and ISM (e.g., LoRa) bands. To avoid\nthe crowd in the ISM band and the cost of the licensed band, we propose a novel\nLPWAN called Sensor Network Over White Spaces (SNOW) by utilizing the TV white\nspaces. Specifically, we design, develop, and experiment SNOW, which is highly\nscalable, energy-efficient, and has a long communication range. SNOW achieves\nscalability and energy efficiency by enabling concurrent packets reception at a\nBS using a single radio from numerous sensors and concurrent packets\ntransmission to numerous sensors from the BS using a single radio,\nsimultaneously, which we achieve by proposing a distributed implementation of\nOFDM. To enable the low-cost and scalable SNOW deployment in practical\napplications, we implement SNOW using the low-cost and small form-factored COTS\ndevices, where we address multiple practical challenges including the high\npeak-to-average power ratio, channel state estimation, and carrier offset\nestimation. Also, we propose an adaptive transmission power protocol to handle\nthe near-far power problem. To enable connecting tens of thousands of nodes\nover hundreds of kilometers, we further propose a network architecture called\nSNOW-tree through a seamless integration of multiple SNOWs where they form a\ntree structure and are under the same management/control. We address the intra-\nand inter-SNOW interferences by formulating a constrained optimization problem\ncalled the scalability optimization problem (SOP) whose objective is to\nmaximize scalability by managing the spectrum sharing across the SNOWs. By\nproving the NP-hardness of SOP, we then propose two polynomial-time methods to\nsolve it: a greedy heuristic algorithm and a 1/2-approximation algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 21:12:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

The\npercent change in CT numbers was measured by changing the phantom size from\nhead to pelvis configuration.Results: When 2D ASG was used as a scatter\nrejection device, CT number variation due to change in phantom dimensions was\nreduced from 23% to 2 - 6%. A grid ratio of 16 yielded the lowest CT number\nvariation. All three 2D ASGs yielded improvement in CNR, up to a factor of two\nin pelvis-sized phantoms. When 2D ASG prototypes were used for both scatter\nrejection and correction, CT number variations were reduced further, to 1.3 -\n2.6%. Conclusions: When 2D ASG was used solely as a scatter rejection device,\nsubstantial improvement in CT number accuracy could be achieved by increasing\nthe grid ratio. 2D ASGs could also provide significant CNR improvement even at\nlower grid ratios. When 2D ASG was used in conjunction with the grid-based\nscatter sampling method, it provided further improvement in CT number accuracy,\nirrespective of the grid ratio, while preserving 2D ASG's capacity to improve\nCNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 22:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

In this study, the\naverage drag force is quantified using particle-resolved direct numerical\nsimulation in a canonical problem: a statistically homogeneous suspension where\nan imposed mean pressure gradient establishes a steady mean slip velocity\nbetween the phases. The effects of particle velocity fluctuations, particle\nclustering, and mobility of particles are studied separately. It is shown that\nthe competing effects of these factors could decrease, increase, or keep\nconstant the drag of freely evolving suspensions in comparison to fixed beds at\ndifferent flow conditions. It is also shown that the effects of particle\nclustering and particle velocity fluctuations are not independent.

Two different approaches (symbolic\nregression and predefined functional forms) are used to develop the drag\ncorrelation. Since this drag correlation has been inferred from simulations of\nparticle suspensions, it includes the effect of the motion of the particles.\nThis drag correlation can be used in computational fluid dynamics simulations\nof particle-laden flows that solve the average two-fluid equations where the\naccuracy of the drag law affects the prediction of overall flow behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 22:06:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 04:12:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:47:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 19:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

Through proper utilization of auxetic structures, designs with\nunprecedented mechanical and structural behaviors can be produced. Taking\nadvantage of this, we present the development of novel and lowcost 3D\nstructures inspired by a simple auxetic unit. The core part, which we call the\nbody in this paper, is a 3D realization of 2D rotating squares. This body\nstructure was formed by joining four similar structures through softer material\nat the vertices. A monolithic structure of this kind is accomplished through a\ncustom-built multi-material 3D printer. The model works in a way that, when\ntorque is applied along the face of the rotational squares, they tend to bend\nat the vertex of the softer material, and due to the connected-ness of the\ndesign, a proper opening and closing motion is achieved. To demonstrate the\npotential of this part as an important component for robots, two applications\nare presented: a soft gripper and a crawling robot. Vacuum-driven actuators\nmove both the applications. The proposed gripper combines the benefits of two\ntypes of grippers whose fingers are placed parallel and equally spaced to each\nother, in a single design. This gripper is adaptable to the size of the object\nand can grasp objects with large and small cross-sections alike. A novel\nbending actuator, which is made of soft material and bends in curvature when\nvacuumed, provides the grasping nature of the gripper. Crawling robots, in\naddition to their versatile nature, provide a better interaction with humans.\nThe designed crawling robot employs negative pressure-driven actuators to\nhighlight linear and turning locomotion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 22:08:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

The DFRE\nmetamodel, which incorporates these capabilities, demonstrates how this\napproach benefits AGI in specific ways such as managing combinatorial explosion\nand enabling cumulative, distributed and federated learning. Our experiments\nshow that the proposed framework achieves 94% accuracy on average on\nunsupervised object detection and recognition. This work is inspired by the\nstate-of-the-art approaches to AGI, recent AGI-aspiring work, the granular\ncomputing community, as well as Alfred Korzybski's general semantics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 23:34:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2020 23:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

This is a natural generalization of the\nmatrix Ising model, that provides a convenient mathematical framework for\ncapturing higher-order dependencies in complex relational data. In this paper,\nwe consider the problem of estimating the natural parameter of the $p$-tensor\nIsing model given a single sample from the distribution on $N$ nodes. Our\nestimate is based on the maximum pseudo-likelihood (MPL) method, which provides\na computationally efficient algorithm for estimating the parameter that avoids\ncomputing the intractable partition function. We derive general conditions\nunder which the MPL estimate is $\\sqrt N$-consistent, that is, it converges to\nthe true parameter at rate $1/\\sqrt N$. In particular, we show the $\\sqrt\nN$-consistency of the MPL estimate in the $p$-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK)\nmodel, spin systems on general $p$-uniform hypergraphs, and Ising models on the\nhypergraph stochastic block model (HSBM). In fact, for the HSBM we pin down the\nexact location of the phase transition threshold, which is determined by the\npositivity of a certain mean-field variational problem, such that above this\nthreshold the MPL estimate is $\\sqrt N$-consistent, while below the threshold\nno estimator is consistent. Finally, we derive the precise fluctuations of the\nMPL estimate in the special case of the $p$-tensor Curie-Weiss model. An\ninteresting consequence of our results is that the MPL estimate in the\nCurie-Weiss model saturates the Cramer-Rao lower bound at all points above the\nestimation threshold, that is, the MPL estimate incurs no loss in asymptotic\nefficiency, even though it is obtained by minimizing only an approximation of\nthe true likelihood function for computational tractability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 00:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

The wave-breaking process\nenergizes turbulent fluctuations that break bubbles in quick succession to\ngenerate a wide range of bubble sizes. Understanding this generation mechanism\npaves the way towards the development of predictive models for large-scale\nmaritime and climate simulations. Garrett et al. (2000) suggested that\nsuper-Hinze-scale turbulent breakup transfers entrained gas from large to small\nbubble sizes in the manner of a cascade. We provide a theoretical basis for\nthis bubble-mass cascade by appealing to how energy is transferred from large\nto small scales in the energy cascade central to single-phase turbulence\ntheories. A bubble break-up cascade requires that break-up events predominantly\ntransfer bubble mass from a certain bubble size to a slightly smaller size on\naverage. This property is called locality. In this paper, we analytically\nquantify locality by extending the population balance equation in conservative\nform to derive the bubble-mass transfer rate from large to small sizes. Using\nour proposed measures of locality, we show that scalings relevant to turbulent\nbubbly flows, including those postulated by Garrett et al. (2000) and observed\nin breaking-wave experiments and simulations, are consistent with a strongly\nlocal transfer rate, where the influence of non-local contributions decays in a\npower-law fashion. These theoretical predictions are confirmed using numerical\nsimulations in Part 2, revealing key physical aspects of the bubble break-up\ncascade phenomenology. Locality supports the universality of turbulent\nsmall-bubble break-up, which simplifies the development of subgrid-scale models\nto predict oceanic small-bubble statistics of practical importance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 00:17:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

It has been indicated that in\nthe two materials within this class, CrI$_3$ and VI$_3$, the magnetic ground\nstate, the band gap, and the Fermi level could be manipulated by varying the\nlayer thickness, strain or doping. To understand how these factors impact the\nproperties, a detailed understanding of the electronic structure would be\nrequired. However, the experimental studies of the electronic structure of\nthese materials are still very sparse. Here, we present the detailed electronic\nstructure of CrI$_3$ and VI$_3$ measured by angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES). Our results show a band-gap of the order of 1 eV, sharply\ncontrasting some theoretical predictions such as Dirac half-metallicity and\nmetallic phases, indicating that the intra-atomic interaction parameter (U) and\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) were not properly accounted for in the calculations.\nWe also find significant differences in the electronic properties of these two\nmaterials, in spite of similarities in their crystal structure. In CrI$_3$, the\nvalence band maximum is dominated by the I 5{\\it p}, whereas in VI$_3$ it is\ndominated by the V 3{\\it d} derived states.

Common to such\napplications is the need to automatically discriminate between breast tissue\nand adjacent anatomy, with the latter being predominantly represented by\npectoralis major (or pectoral muscle). Especially in the case of mammograms\nacquired in the mediolateral oblique (MLO) view, the muscle is easily\nconfusable with some elements of breast anatomy due to their morphological and\nphotometric similarity. As a result, the problem of automatic detection and\nsegmentation of pectoral muscle in MLO mammograms remains a challenging task,\ninnovative approaches to which are still required and constantly searched for.\nTo address this problem, the present paper introduces a two-step segmentation\nstrategy based on a combined use of data-driven prediction (deep learning) and\ngraph-based image processing. In particular, the proposed method employs a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) which is designed to predict the location of\nbreast-pectoral boundary at different levels of spatial resolution.\nSubsequently, the predictions are used by the second stage of the algorithm, in\nwhich the desired boundary is recovered as a solution to the shortest path\nproblem on a specially designed graph.

The task is to recognize non-native speech from children of\nvarious age groups given a limited amount of speech. Moreover, the speech being\nspontaneous has false starts transcribed as partial words, which in the test\ntranscriptions leads to unseen partial words. To cope with these two\nchallenges, we investigate a data augmentation-based approach. Firstly, we\napply the prosody-based data augmentation to supplement the audio data.\nSecondly, we simulate false starts by introducing partial-word noise in the\nlanguage modeling corpora creating new words. Acoustic models trained on\nprosody-based augmented data outperform the models using the baseline recipe or\nthe SpecAugment-based augmentation. The partial-word noise also helps to\nimprove the baseline language model.

While federated learning (i.e.,\nmany based on stochastic gradient algorithms) has shown great promise, there\nare still many challenging problems in protecting privacy, especially during\nthe process of gradients update and exchange. This paper presents the first\ngradient-free federated learning framework called GRAFFL for learning a\nBayesian generative model based on approximate Bayesian computation. Unlike\nconventional federated learning algorithms based on gradients, our framework\ndoes not require to disassemble a model (i.e., to linear components) or to\nperturb data (or encryption of data for aggregation) to preserve privacy.\nInstead, this framework uses implicit information derived from each\nparticipating institution to learn posterior distributions of parameters.

To extract as much information as\npossible from GW observations we must develop methods to reduce the cost of\nBayesian inference. In this paper, we use artificial neural networks (ANNs) and\nthe parallelisation power of graphics processing units (GPUs) to improve the\nsurrogate modelling method, which can produce accelerated versions of existing\nmodels. As a first application of our method, ANN-Sur, we build a time-domain\nsurrogate model of the spin-aligned binary black hole (BBH) waveform model\nSEOBNRv4. We achieve median mismatches of 2e-5 and mismatches no worse than\n2e-3. For a typical BBH waveform generated from 12 Hz with a total mass of $60\nM_\\odot$ the original SEOBNRv4 model takes 1812 ms. Existing bespoke code\noptimisations (SEOBNRv4opt) reduced this to 91.6 ms and the interpolation\nbased, frequency-domain surrogate SEOBNRv4ROM can generate this waveform in 6.9\nms. Our ANN-Sur model, when run on a CPU takes 2.7 ms and just 0.4 ms when run\non a GPU. ANN-Sur can also generate large batches of waveforms simultaneously.\nWe find that batches of up to 10^4 waveforms can be evaluated on a GPU in just\n163 ms, corresponding to a time per waveform of 0.016 ms. This method is a\npromising way to utilise the parallelisation power of GPUs to drastically\nincrease the computational efficiency of Bayesian parameter estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 07:54:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 10:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

To validate this\napproach, we train state-of-the-art deep neural networks to accomplish various\nmedical image analysis tasks using simulated data from VR-Caps and evaluate the\nperformance of these models on real medical data. Results demonstrate the\nusefulness and effectiveness of the proposed virtual platform in developing\nalgorithms that quantify fractional coverage, camera trajectory, 3D map\nreconstruction, and disease classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 09:54:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 12:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

The proposed OT-cycleGAN\narchitecture is rigorously derived from a dual formulation of the optimal\ntransport formulation using a specially designed penalized least squares cost.\nThe experimental results show that our method can reconstruct high resolution\nMR images from accelerated k- space data from both single and multiple coil\nacquisition, without requiring matched reference data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 12:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

Previous works usually focus on\nlearning an end-to-end (direct) policy to directly output joint torques. While\nthe direct policy seems convenient, the resultant performance may not meet our\nexpectations. To improve its performance, more sophisticated reward functions\nor more structured policies can be utilized. This paper focuses on the latter\nbecause the structured policy is more intuitive and can inherit insights from\nprevious model-based controllers. It is unsurprising that the structure, such\nas a better choice of the action space and constraints of motion trajectory,\nmay benefit the training process and the final performance of the policy at the\ncost of generality, but the quantitative effect is still unclear. To analyze\nthe effect of the structure quantitatively, this paper investigates three\npolicies with different levels of structure in learning quadruped locomotion: a\ndirect policy, a structured policy, and a highly structured policy. The\nstructured policy is trained to learn a task-space impedance controller and the\nhighly structured policy learns a controller tailored for trot running, which\nwe adopt from previous work. To evaluate trained policies, we design a\nsimulation experiment to track different desired velocities under force\ndisturbances. Simulation results show that structured policy and highly\nstructured policy require 1/3 and 3/4 fewer training steps than the direct\npolicy to achieve a similar level of cumulative reward, and seem more robust\nand efficient than the direct policy. We highlight that the structure embedded\nin the policies significantly affects the overall performance of learning a\ncomplicated task when complex dynamics are involved, such as legged locomotion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 12:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

The first CMOS logic style that achieved truly, fully adiabatic\noperation if leakage was negligible (CRL) is not fully static, which leads to a\nnumber of practical engineering difficulties in the presence of certain\nnonidealities.

It is shown that the introduction of the non-associativity of the\nalgebra of physical fields in a homogeneous space leads to a nonlinear\nequation, the solutions of which can be considered as two-stage inflation.\nUsing the example of reduction $T\\times R^7$ to $T\\times R^3$, it is shown that\nthere is a continuous cross-linking of the Friedmann and inflationary stages of\nalgebraic inflation at times $10^{-15}$ with the number of baryons $10^{80}$ in\nthe Universe.

As long as the upstream hotspot\nis less contagious than the downstream one, increasing the wind speed leads to\na monotonic decrease of the infection peak in the downstream hotspot. Once the\nupstream hotspot becomes about between twice and five times more infectious\nthan the downstream one, an optimal wind speed emerges, whereby a local minimum\npeak intensity is attained in the downstream hotspot, along with a local\nmaximum beyond which the beneficial effect of the wind is restored. Since this\nnon-monotonic trend is reminiscent of the equation of state of non-ideal f\nluids, we dub the above phenomena epidemic condensation. When the relative\ninfectivity of the upstream hotspot exceeds about a factor five, the beneficial\neffect of the wind above the optimal speed is completely lost: any wind speed\nabove the optimal one leads to a higher infection peak. It is also found that\nspatial correlation between the two hotspots decay much more slowly than their\ninverse distance. It is hoped that the above findings may offer a qualitative\nclue for optimal confinement policies between different cities and urban\nagglomerates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 20:15:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 08:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-24"}

That was mainly a result of swift restrictive measures\nsuch as statewide quarantine and lock-down orders to confine the spread of the\nvirus. This work is driven by analyzing five types of real-world data sets from\nDetroit related to traffic volume, daily cases, weather, social distancing\nindex, and crashes from January 2019 to June 2020. The primary goal is figuring\nout the impacts of COVID-19 on the transportation network usage (traffic\nvolume) and safety (crashes) for the Detroit, exploring the potential\ncorrelation between these diverse data features, and determining whether each\ntype of data (e.g., traffic volume data) could be a useful factor in the\nconfirmed-cases prediction. In addition, a deep learning model was developed\nusing long short-term memory networks to predict the number of confirmed cases\nwithin the next one week. The model demonstrated a promising prediction result\nwith a coefficient of determination (R^2) of up to approximately 0.91.\nMoreover, in order to provide statistical evaluation measures of confirmed-case\nprediction and to quantify the prediction effectiveness of each type of data,\nthe prediction results of six feature groups are presented and analyzed.\nFurthermore, six essential observations with supporting evidence and analyses\nare presented. The goal of this paper is to present a proposed approach which\ncan be applied, customised, adjusted, and replicated for analysis of the impact\nof COVID-19 on a transportation network and prediction of the anticipated\nCOVID-19 cases using a similar data set obtained for other large cities in the\nUSA or from around the world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 19:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}
