We have performed a detailed\nmulti-wavelength analysis of the core of XDCPJ0044.0-2033 (XDCP0044), one of\nthe most massive and densest galaxy clusters currently known at redshift z~1.6,\nwhose central galaxy population shows high star formation compared to lower-z\nclusters and an X-ray AGN located close to its center.

In the central region\nof the cluster (~70x70 kpc^2), 2 systems of interacting galaxies have been\nidentified and studied (Complex A and B), with a total of 7 confirmed cluster\nmembers. These galaxies show perturbed morphologies and 3 of them show signs of\nAGN activity. In particular, 2 type-1 AGN with typical broad lines have been\nfound at the center of each complex (both of them X-ray obscured and highly\naccreting; Eddington ratio ~0.5), while a type-2 AGN has been discovered in\nComplex A.

The 3 AGN provide one of\nthe closest AGN triple at z>1 revealed so far with a minimum(maximum) projected\ndistance of ~10(40) kpc. The observation of high star formation, merger\nsignatures and nuclear activity in the core of XDCP0044 suggests that all these\nprocesses are key ingredients in shaping the nascent BCG.

They have short\nand energetic lives, and many of them inevitably explode as a supernova and\nbecome a neutron star or black hole. In turn, the formation, evolution and\nexplosive deaths of massive stars impact the surrounding interstellar medium\nand shape the evolution of their host galaxies. Yet the chemical and dynamical\nevolution of a massive star, including the chemical yield of the ultimate\nsupernova and the remnant mass of the compact object, strongly depend on the\ninterior physics of the progenitor star. We currently lack empirically\ncalibrated prescriptions for various physical processes at work within massive\nstars, but this is now being remedied by asteroseismology. The study of stellar\nstructure and evolution using stellar oscillations - asteroseismology - has\nundergone a revolution in the last two decades thanks to high-precision time\nseries photometry from space telescopes. In particular, the long-term light\ncurves provided by the MOST, CoRoT, BRITE, Kepler/K2 and TESS missions provided\ninvaluable data sets in terms of photometric precision, duration and frequency\nresolution to successfully apply asteroseismology to massive stars and probe\ntheir interior physics. The observation and subsequent modelling of stellar\npulsations in massive stars has revealed key missing ingredients in stellar\nstructure and evolution models of these stars. Thus asteroseismology has opened\na new window into calibrating stellar physics within a highly degenerate part\nof the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. In this review, I provide a historical\noverview of the progress made using ground-based and early space missions, and\ndiscuss more recent advances and breakthroughs in our understanding of massive\nstar interiors by means of asteroseismology with modern space telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 16:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

In many situatons, the relative phase difference,\ntogether with coherence patterns, have been employed to infer the direction of\nthe information flow. However, it has been recently shown in local field\npotential data from monkeys the existence of a synchronized regime in which\nunidirectionally coupled areas can present both positive and negative phase\ndifferences. During the counterintuitive regime, called anticipated\nsynchronization (AS), the phase difference does not reflect the causality. Here\nwe investigate coherence and causality at the alpha frequency band (10 Hz)\nbetween pairs of electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes in humans during a\nGO/NO-GO task. We show that human EEG signals can exhibit anticipated\nsynchronization, which is characterized by a unidirectional influence from an\nelectrode A to an electrode B, but the electrode B leads the electrode A in\ntime. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first verification of AS in EEG\nsignals and in the human brain. The usual delayed synchronization (DS) regime\nis also present between many pairs. DS is characterized by a unidirectional\ninfluence from an electrode A to an electrode B and a positive phase difference\nbetween A and B which indicates that the electrode A leads the electrode B in\ntime. Moreover, we show that EEG signals exhibit diversity in phase relations:\nthe pairs of electrodes can present in-phase, anti-phase, or out-of-phase\nsynchronization with a similar distribution of positive and negative phase\ndifferences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 16:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

The Vertical Shear Instability (VSI) is a\nhydrodynamic mechanism, operating in PPDs if the local rate of thermal\nrelaxation is high enough. Previous studies of the VSI have, however, relied on\nthe assumption of constant cooling rates, or neglected the finite coupling time\nbetween the gas particles and the dust grains. Here, we present the results of\nhydrodynamic simulations of PPDs with the PLUTO code that include a more\nrealistic thermal relaxation prescription, which enables us to study the VSI in\nthe optically thick and optically thin parts of the disk under consideration of\nthe thermal dust-gas coupling. We show the VSI to cause turbulence even in the\noptically thick inner regions of PPDs in our two- and three-dimensional\nsimulations. The collisional decoupling of dust and gas particles in the upper\natmosphere and the correspondingly inefficient thermal relaxation rates lead to\nthe damping of the VSI turbulence.

Existing machine learning techniques often focus\non spectral and spatial features from raster images without fully incorporating\nthe geographic terrain within classification models.

We develop a\nframework for modeling the distributions of optical TDF detections in surveys\nacross attributes of the host galaxies and the flares themselves. This model\nfolds in effects of the stellar disruption rate in each galaxy, the flare\nluminosity and temperature distributions, the effects of obscuration and\nreddening by dust in the host galaxy, and survey selection criteria.

As in the fibre-optic\nchannel the shaping gain is closely related to the nonlinearity tolerance of a\ngiven modulation format, predicting the effect of nonlinearity is key to\neffectively optimise the transmitted constellation. Many analytical models\navailable in the optical communication literature allow, within a first-order\nperturbation framework, the computation of the average power of the nonlinear\ninterference (NLI) accumulated in coherent fibre-optic transmission systems.\nHowever, all current models only operate under the assumption of a transmitted\npolarisation-multiplexed, two-dimensional (PM-2D) modulation format.

The proof makes heavy use of martingale concentration to\noptimally treat statistical dependencies across layers of the initial random\nnetwork. This approach should be of use in establishing similar results for\nother network architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 19:20:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 06:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}

We first propose a network\n(VANp) that when presented with the second-order statistics of the input, i.e.,\neach sample has a mean and a variance, it propagates the mean and the variance\nthroughout the network to deliver outputs with second order statistics. In this\nframework, both the input and the output could be interpreted as Gaussians. To\ndo so, we derive differentiable analytic solutions, or reasonable\napproximations, to propagate across commonly used NN layers. To train the\nnetwork, we define a differentiable loss based on the KL-divergence between the\npredicted Gaussian and a Gaussian around the ground truth action borders, and\nuse standard back-propagation. Importantly, the variances propagation in VANp\ndoes not require any additional parameters, and during testing, does not\nrequire any additional computations either. In action localization, the means\nand the variances of the input are computed at pooling operations, that are\ntypically used to bring arbitrarily long videos to a vector with fixed\ndimensions. Second, we propose two alternative formulations that augment the\nfirst (respectively, the last) layer of a regression network with additional\nparameters so as to take in the input (respectively, predict in the output)\nboth means and variances. Results in the action localization problem show that\nthe incorporation of second order statistics improves over the baseline\nnetwork, and that VANp surpasses the accuracy of virtually all other two-stage\nnetworks without involving any additional parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 20:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-27"}

For rational conformal field theories (RCFT), we find all quantities\nto compute the quantum dimension of the primary operator inserted. In contrast,\nwe find the correlation measures to grow (logarithmically) without bound in all\n$c > 1$ conformal field theories with a finite twist gap. In comparing the\ncalculations in the two classes of theories, we are able to identify the\ndynamical mechanism for the breakdown of the quasi-particle picture in 2D\nconformal field theories. Intriguingly, we also find preliminary evidence that\nour general lessons apply to quantum systems considerably distinct from\nconformal field theories, such as integrable and chaotic spin chains,\nsuggesting a universality of entanglement dynamics in non-equilibrium systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 20:47:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

Among other,\nSpanier proved that for every space $X$ there exists a universal lifting space,\nwhich however need not be simply connected, unless the base space $X$ is\nsemi-locally simply connected. The question on what exactly is the fundamental\ngroup of the universal space was left unanswered.\n  The main source of lifting spaces are inverse limits of covering spaces over\n$X$, or more generally, over some inverse system of spaces converging to $X$.\nEvery metric space $X$ can be obtained as a limit of an inverse system of\npolyhedra, and so inverse limits of covering spaces over the system yield\nlifting spaces over $X$. They are related to the geometry (in particular the\nfundamental group) of $X$ in a similar way as the covering spaces over\npolyhedra are related to the fundamental group of their base. Thus lifting\nspaces appear as a natural replacement for the concept of covering spaces over\nbase spaces with bad local properties.\n  In this paper we develop a general theory of lifting spaces and prove that\nthey are preserved by products, inverse limits and other important\nconstructions. We show that maps from $X$ to polyhedra give rise to coverings\nover $X$ and use that to prove that for a connected, locally path connected and\nparacompact $X$, the fundamental group of the above-mentioned Spanier's\nuniversal space is precisely the intersection of all Spanier groups associated\nto open covers of $X$, and that the later coincides with the shape kernel of\n$X$. Furthermore, we examine in more detail lifting spaces over $X$ that arise\nas inverse limits of coverings over some approximations of $X$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 20:49:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-27"}

The problem has important\napplications in hydrology, planetary science, and biochemistry but is uniquely\nchallenging for several reasons. First, the spatial extent of class segments\nfollows surface contours in the topological space, regardless of their spatial\nshapes and directions. Second, the topological structure exists in multiple\nspatial scales based on different surface resolutions. Existing widely\nsuccessful deep learning models for image segmentation are often not applicable\ndue to their reliance on convolution and pooling operations to learn regular\nstructural patterns on a grid. In contrast, we propose to represent surface\ntopological structure by a contour tree skeleton, which is a polytree capturing\nthe evolution of surface contours at different elevation levels. We further\ndesign a graph neural network based on the contour tree hierarchy to model\nsurface topological structure at different spatial scales. Experimental\nevaluations based on real-world hydrological datasets show that our model\noutperforms several baseline methods in classification accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 20:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-27"}

Face clustering for\nlong-form content is challenging because of variations in appearance and lack\nof supporting large-scale labeled data. Our work in this paper focuses on two\nkey aspects of this problem: the lack of domain-specific training or benchmark\ndatasets, and adapting face embeddings learned on web images to long-form\ncontent, specifically movies. First, we present a dataset of over 169,000 face\ntracks curated from 240 Hollywood movies with weak labels on whether a pair of\nface tracks belong to the same or a different character. We propose an offline\nalgorithm based on nearest-neighbor search in the embedding space to mine\nhard-examples from these tracks. We then investigate triplet-loss and multiview\ncorrelation-based methods for adapting face embeddings to hard-examples. Our\nexperimental results highlight the usefulness of weakly labeled data for\ndomain-specific feature adaptation. Overall, we find that multiview\ncorrelation-based adaptation yields more discriminative and robust face\nembeddings. Its performance on downstream face verification and clustering\ntasks is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art results in this domain. We\nalso present the SAIL-Movie Character Benchmark corpus developed to augment\nexisting benchmarks.

One application of flip paths to\nEuclidean distance geometry and Moebius geometry is a recent, simple,\nconstructive proof by Connelly and Gortler of the Koebe-Andreev-Thurston circle\npacking theorem that relies on the existence of a flip path between any two\ntriangulation graphs. More generally, length and other structural quantities on\nminimum (length) flip paths are metrics on the space of triangulations. In the\ngeometric setting, finding a minimum flip path between two triangulations is\nNP-complete. However, for two lattice triangulations, used to model electron\nspin systems, Eppstein and Caputo et al. gave algorithms running in\n$O\\left(n^2\\right)$ time, where $n$ is the number of points in the point-set.\nTheir algorithms apply to constrained flip paths that ensure a set of\n\\emph{constraint} edges are present in every triangulation along the path. We\nreformulate the problem and provide an algorithm that runs in\n$O\\left(n^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\right)$ time. In fact, for a large, natural class of\ninputs, the bound is tight, i.e., our algorithm runs in time linear in the\nlength of this output flip path. Our results rely on structural elucidation of\nminimum flip paths. Specifically, for any two lattice triangulations, we use\nFarey sequences to construct a partially-ordered sets of flips, called a\nminimum flip \\emph{plan}, whose linear-orderings are minimum flip paths between\nthem. To prove this, we characterize a minimum flip plan that starts from an\nequilateral lattice triangulation - i.e., a lattice triangulation whose edges\nare all unit-length - and \\emph{forces a point-pair to become an edge}. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our results are the first to exploit Farey sequences for\nelucidating the structure of flip paths between lattice triangulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 22:16:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 15:17:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 14:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

In the forecast step, vortex elements in each ensemble member are\nadvected by the flow and new elements are released from each edge of the plate;\nthe elements are aggregated to maintain an efficient representation. The vortex\nelements and leading edge constraint are corrected in the analysis step by\nassimilating the surface pressure differences across the plate measured from\nthe truth system. We show that the overall framework can be physically\ninterpreted as a series of adjustments to the position and shape of an\nelliptical region of uncertainty associated with each vortex element.

Quite naturally, these deletion\nmechanisms are really useful for removing past posts as and when needed.\nHowever, these same mechanisms also leave the users potentially vulnerable to\nattacks by adversaries who specifically seek the users' damaging content and\nexploit the act of deletion as a strong signal for identifying such content.\nUnfortunately, today user experiences and contextual expectations regarding\nsuch attacks on deletion privacy and deletion privacy in general are not well\nunderstood.\n  To that end, in this paper, we conduct a user survey-based exploration\ninvolving 191 participants to unpack their prior deletion experiences, their\nexpectations of deletion privacy, and how effective they find the current\ndeletion mechanisms. We find that more than 80% of the users have deleted at\nleast a social media post, and users self-reported that, on average, around 35%\nof their deletions happened after a week of posting. While the participants\nidentified the irrelevancy (due to time passing) as the main reason for content\nremoval, most of them believed that deletions indicate that the deleted content\nincludes some damaging information to the owner. Importantly, the participants\nare significantly more concerned about their deletions being noticed by\nlarge-scale data collectors (e.g., the government) than individuals from their\nsocial circle. Finally, the participants felt that popular deletion mechanisms\nare not very effective in protecting the privacy of those deletions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 00:44:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 05:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

CYRA measurements will allow\nnew and better 3D extrapolations of the solar magnetic field and will provide\nmore accurate boundary conditions for solar activity models. Superior spectral\nresolution of 150,000 and better allows enhanced observations of the\nchromosphere in the carbon monoxide (CO) spectral bands and will yield a better\nunderstanding of energy transport in the solar atmosphere.

However, the strict investigation of lattice thermal\nconductivity (kappa_L) of 2D Ga2O3 is still lacking, which has impeded the\nwidespread use in practical applications.

It is quite important to detect the emergency vehicles (e.g;\nambulance) arrival to traffic light to give the green light for it to pass\nthrough. Many researchers have suggested and patented emergency vehicles\ndetection systems however, according to our knowledge, none of them considered\nsolving the effect of giving extra green time to a road while the queues are\nbeing built on others. This paper considers the problem of finding a better\ntraffic light phase plan to stabilize/recover the situation at an effected\nintersection after solving an emergency vehicle existence. A hardware setup and\na novel messaging protocol have been suggested to be set on roads and vehicles\nto collect roads real time data. In addition, a novel decision making protocol\nhas been created to make the use of the collected data for making a better\ntraffic light phase plan for an intersection. The phase plan has two main\ndecisions to be made; which light has a higher priority to be green in the next\nphase, and how long the green phase should be. After simulating the proposed\nsystem using our customized simulator written in Matlab programing language and\ncomparing its performance with other related works, significant enhancements\nhave been observed in terms of stabilizing the queue lengths at an intersection\nafter solving an emergency case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 02:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

In this work, we consider the more realistic scenario where the\nusers have only unlabeled data, while the server has some labeled data, and\nwhere the amount of labeled data is smaller than the amount of unlabeled data.\nWe call this learning problem semi-supervised federated learning (SSFL).

SIGNNAP formalizes the \\emph{stability} and\n\\emph{identifiability} by a contrastive objective and preserves the\n\\emph{smoothness} with existing GNN backbones. The proposed method is a generic\nframework that can be equipped with many other backbone models (e.g. GCN,\nGraphSage and GAT). Extensive experiments on six benchmarks under both\ntransductive and inductive learning setups of node classification demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method.

In this paper, to\nsolve these problems simultaneously, we propose a low light image enhancement\nmethod that can combined with supervised learning and previous HSV (Hue,\nSaturation, Value) or Retinex model based image enhancement methods. First, we\nanalyse the relationship between the HSV color space and the Retinex theory,\nand show that the V channel (V channel in HSV color space, equals the maximum\nchannel in RGB color space) of the enhanced image can well represent the\ncontrast and brightness enhancement process. Then, a data-driven conditional\nre-enhancement network (denoted as CRENet) is proposed. The network takes low\nlight images as input and the enhanced V channel as condition, then it can\nre-enhance the contrast and brightness of the low light image and at the same\ntime reduce noise and color distortion. It should be noted that during the\ntraining process, any paired images with different exposure time can be used\nfor training, and there is no need to carefully select the supervised images\nwhich will save a lot. In addition, it takes less than 20 ms to process a color\nimage with the resolution 400*600 on a 2080Ti GPU. Finally, some comparative\nexperiments are implemented to prove the effectiveness of the method. The\nresults show that the method proposed in this paper can significantly improve\nthe quality of the enhanced image, and by combining with other image contrast\nenhancement methods, the final enhancement result can even be better than the\nreference image in contrast and brightness.

A convolution formula for the cross sections in\nterms of those for the bound proton is derived. Novel scattering amplitudes for\na bound moving nucleon have been obtained and used. A state-of-the-art nuclear\nspectral function, based on the AV18 potential, exact in the two-body part,\nwith the recoiling system in its ground state, and modelled in the remaining\ncontribution, with the recoiling system in an excited state, has been used.\nDifferent parametrizations of the generalized parton distributions of the\nstruck proton have been tested.

If the magnetic axis is misaligned with the star rotation axis,\nthe current sheet is an oscillatory structure filling an equatorial wedge\ndetermined by the inclination angle, known as the striped wind. Relativistic\nreconnection could lead to significant dissipation of magnetic energy and\nparticle acceleration although the efficiency of this process is debated in\nthis context. In this study, we aim at reconciling global models of pulsar wind\ndynamics and reconnection in the stripes within the same numerical framework,\nin order to shed new light on dissipation and particle acceleration in pulsar\nwinds. To this end, we perform large three-dimensional particle-in-cell\nsimulations of a split-monopole magnetosphere, from the stellar surface up to\nfifty light-cylinder radii away from the pulsar. Plasmoid-dominated\nreconnection efficiently fragments the current sheet into a dynamical network\nof interacting flux ropes separated by secondary current sheets which consume\nthe field efficiently at all radii, even past the fast magnetosonic point. Our\nresults suggest there is a universal dissipation radius solely determined by\nthe reconnection rate in the sheet, lying well upstream the termination shock\nradius in isolated pair producing pulsars. The wind bulk Lorentz factor is much\nless relativistic than previously thought. In the comoving frame, the wind is\ncomposed of hot pairs trapped within flux ropes with a hard broad power-law\nspectrum, whose maximum energy is limited by the magnetization of the wind at\nlaunch. We conclude that the striped wind is most likely fully dissipated when\nit enters the pulsar wind nebula. The predicted wind particle spectrum after\ndissipation is reminiscent of the Crab Nebula radio-emitting electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 09:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

Addressing this ambiguity requires to aggregate various cues over\nthe entire image, such as body sizes, scene layouts, and inter-person\nrelationships. However, most previous methods adopt a top-down scheme that\nfirst performs 2D pose detection and then regresses the 3D pose and scale for\neach detected person individually, ignoring global contextual cues. In this\npaper, we propose a novel system that first regresses a set of 2.5D\nrepresentations of body parts and then reconstructs the 3D absolute poses based\non these 2.5D representations with a depth-aware part association algorithm.\nSuch a single-shot bottom-up scheme allows the system to better learn and\nreason about the inter-person depth relationship, improving both 3D and 2D pose\nestimation.

We focus on one particular form of visual\nattention known as feature-based attention, which is concerned with identifying\nfeatures of the visual input that are important for the current task regardless\nof their spatial location. Visual feature-based attention has been proposed to\nimprove the efficiency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) by reducing the\ndimensionality of state representations and guiding learning towards relevant\nfeatures. Despite achieving human level performance in complex perceptual-motor\ntasks, Deep RL algorithms have been consistently criticised for their poor\nefficiency and lack of flexibility. Visual feature-based attention therefore\nrepresents one option for addressing these criticisms. Nevertheless, it is\nstill an open question how the brain is able to learn which features to attend\nto during RL. To help answer this question we propose a novel algorithm, termed\nSelective Particle Attention (SPA), which imbues a Deep RL agent with the\nability to perform selective feature-based attention. SPA learns which\ncombinations of features to attend to based on their bottom-up saliency and how\naccurately they predict future reward. We evaluate SPA on a multiple choice\ntask and a 2D video game that both involve raw pixel input and dynamic changes\nto the task structure. We show various benefits of SPA over approaches that\nnaively attend to either all or random subsets of features. Our results\ndemonstrate (1) how visual feature-based attention in Deep RL models can\nimprove their learning efficiency and ability to deal with sudden changes in\ntask structure and (2) that particle filters may represent a viable\ncomputational account of how visual feature-based attention occurs in the\nbrain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 11:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

The successful stellar photometric surveys stemming from the Kepler\nand TESS observations led to the determination of rotation periods in tens of\nthousands of young and active stars. However, there is still a lack of\ninformation about rotation periods of older and less active stars, like the\nSun. The irregular temporal profiles of light curves caused by the decay times\nof active regions, which are comparable to or even shorter than stellar\nrotation periods, combine with the random emergence of active regions to make\nperiod determination for such stars very difficult. We tested the performance\nof the new method for the determination of stellar rotation periods against\nstars with previously determined rotation periods. The method is based on\ncalculating the gradient of the power spectrum (GPS) and identifying the\nposition of the inflection point (i.e. point with the highest gradient). The\nGPS method is specifically aimed at determining rotation periods of low\nactivity stars like the Sun. We applied the GPS method to 1047 Sun-like stars\nobserved by the Kepler telescope. We show that the GPS method returns precise\nvalues of stellar rotation periods. Furthermore, it allows us to constrain the\nratio between facular and spot areas of active regions at the moment of their\nemergence. We show that relative facular area decreases with stellar rotation\nrate. Our results suggest that the GPS method can be successfully applied to\nretrieve periods of stars with both regular and non-regular light curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 11:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Although deep learning based algorithms have\ndemonstrated potential in forming an automated approach in recent years, the\nlabelling efforts needed for covering different features in different regions\nlargely constrain its effectiveness in large-scale problems.

We\ncompare these predictions with each other, and with the SED of the AGB star EP\nAqr that we use as a benchmark since its envelope is disc-like and known to\nharbour spiral arms, as seen in CO. The SEDs involving the most massive\nenvelopes are those for which the different geometries have the largest impact,\nprimarily on the silicate features at 10 and 18 um. These different shapes\noriginate from large differences in optical depths. Massive spirals and discs\nappear akin to black bodies. Optically thick edge-on spirals and discs (with\ndust masses of 1e-4 and 1e-5 Msun) exhibit black-body SEDs that appear cooler\nthan those from face-on structures and spheres of the same mass, while\noptically thick face-on distributions appear as warmer emission. We find that\nour more realistic models, combined spherical and spiral distributions, are 0.1\nto 0.5 times less massive than spheres with similar SEDs. More extreme, less\nrealistic scenarios give that spirals and discs are 0.01 to 0.05 times less\nmassive than corresponding spheres. This means that adopting the wrong geometry\nfor an AGB circumstellar envelope may result in a MLR that is incorrect by as\nmuch as 1 to 2 orders of magnitude when derived from SED fitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 12:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

We\nsuspect that the missing ingredients to explain them probably lie in the\ncontinuous interaction of the central binary with its circumstellar\nenvironment. Aims: We aim at studying the circumbinary material in these\ncomplex systems by investigating the connection between the innermost and\nlarge-scale structures. Methods: We perform high-angular resolution\nobservations in the near-infrared continuum of HD101584, which has a complex\nstructure as seen at millimeter wavelengths with a disk-like morphology and a\nbipolar outflow due to an episode of strong binary interaction. To account for\nthe complexity of the target we first perform an image reconstruction and use\nthis result to fit a geometrical model to extract the morphological and thermal\nfeatures of the environment. Results: The image reveals an unexpected\ndouble-ring structure. We interpret the inner ring to be produced by emission\nfrom dust located in the plane of the disk and the outer ring to be produced by\nemission from dust that is located 1.6[D/1kpc] au above the disk plane. The\ninner ring diameter (3.94[D/1kpc] au), and temperature (T=1540$\\pm$10K) are\ncompatible with the dust sublimation front of the disk. The origin of the\nout-of-plane ring (with a diameter of 7.39[D/1kpc] au and a temperature of\n1014$\\pm10$K) could be due to episodic ejection or a dust condensation front in\nthe outflow. Conclusion: The observed outer ring is possibly linked with the\nblue-shifted side of the large scale outflow seen by ALMA and is tracing its\nlaunching location to the central star. Such observations give morphological\nconstraints on the ejection mechanism. Additional observations are needed to\nconstrain the origin of the out-of-plane structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 13:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

In order to\nobtain converged results, we employ the similarity renormalization group (SRG)\nto soften the nucleon-nucleon and hyperon-nucleon interactions. Although the\ndependence on this evolution of the Hamiltonian is significant, we show that a\nstrong correlation of the results can be used to identify preferred SRG\nparameters.

This\nformulation results in a TagGNN model that utilizes heterogeneous graph neural\nnetworks with multiple types of nodes and edges.

For the oblique impact of a Leidenfrost drop, which has a vapor\nlayer under its bottom surface to prevent its direct contact with the\nsuperheated substrate, the drop can nearly frictionlessly slide along the\nsubstrate accompanied by the spreading and the retracting. To individually\nstudy these processes, we experimentally observe ethanol drops impact on\nsuperheated inclined substrates using high-speed imaging from two different\nviews synchronously. We first study the dynamic Leidenfrost temperature, which\nmainly depends on the normal Weber number ${We}_\\perp $. Then the substrate\ntemperature is set to be high enough to study the Leidenfrost drop behaviors.\nDuring the spreading process, drops always keep uniform. And the maximum\nspreading factor $D_m/D_0$ follows a power-law dependence on the large normal\nWeber number ${We}_\\perp $ as $D_m/D_0 = \\sqrt{We_\\perp /12+2}$ for $We_\\perp\n\\geq 30$. During the retracting process, drops with low impact velocities\nbecome non-uniform due to the gravity effect. For the sliding process, the\nresidence time of all studied drops is nearly a constant, which is not affected\nby the inclination and $We$ number. The frictionless vapor layer results in the\ndimensionless sliding distance $L/D_0$ follows a power-law dependence on the\nparallel Weber number $We_\\parallel$ as $L/D_0 \\propto We_\\parallel^{1/2}$.\nWithout direct contact with the substrate, the behaviors of drops can be\nseparately determined by ${We}_\\perp $ and $We_\\parallel$. When the impact\nvelocity is too high, the drop fragments into many tiny droplets, which is\ncalled the splashing phenomenon.

So far, many\nresearchers have conducted attacking research on text-based CAPTCHAs deployed\nby different companies (such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple) and achieved\ncertain results.However, most of these attacks have some shortcomings, such as\npoor portability of attack methods, requiring a series of data preprocessing\nsteps, and relying on large amounts of labeled CAPTCHAs.

Together with the increasing scholarly attention on task offloading,\nthe problem of edge servers' resource allocation has been widely studied. Most\nof previous works focus on a single edge server (ES) serving multiple terminal\nentities (TEs), which restricts their access to sufficient resources. In this\npaper, we consider a MEC resource transaction market with multiple ESs and\nmultiple TEs, which are interdependent and mutually influence each other.\nHowever, this many-to-many interaction requires resolving several problems,\nincluding task allocation, TEs' selection on ESs and conflicting interests of\nboth parties. Game theory can be used as an effective tool to realize the\ninterests of two or more conflicting individuals in the trading market.\nTherefore, we propose a bilateral game framework among multiple ESs and\nmultiple TEs by modeling the task outsourcing problem as two noncooperative\ngames: the supplier and customer side games. In the first game, the supply\nfunction bidding mechanism is employed to model the ESs' profit maximization\nproblem. The ESs submit their bids to the scheduler, where the computing\nservice price is computed and sent to the TEs. While in the second game, TEs\ndetermine the optimal demand profiles according to ESs' bids to maximize their\npayoff. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in the\naforementioned games are proved. A distributed task outsourcing algorithm\n(DTOA) is designed to determine the equilibrium. Simulation results have\ndemonstrated the superior performance of DTOA in increasing the ESs' profit and\nTEs' payoff, as well as flattening the peak and off-peak load.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-27"}

This modeling shows that the weathering of\nmineral assemblages in a given rock, rather than individual minerals, is\ncrucial to determine weathering rates at planetary surfaces. By implementing a\nfluid-transport controlled approach, we further mimic chemical kinetics and\nthermodynamics to determine weathering rates for three types of rocks inspired\nby the lithologies of Earth's continental and oceanic crust, and its upper\nmantle. We find that thermodynamic weathering rates of a continental crust-like\nlithology are about one to two orders of magnitude lower than those of a\nlithology characteristic of the oceanic crust.

Incumbent solutions such as SCOOT and SCATS\nrequire regular and time-consuming calibration, can't optimise well for\nmultiple road use modalities, and require the manual curation of many\nimplementation plans. A recent alternative to these approaches are deep\nreinforcement learning algorithms, in which an agent learns how to take the\nmost appropriate action for a given state of the system. This is guided by\nneural networks approximating a reward function that provides feedback to the\nagent regarding the performance of the actions taken, making it sensitive to\nthe specific reward function chosen. Several authors have surveyed the reward\nfunctions used in the literature, but attributing outcome differences to reward\nfunction choice across works is problematic as there are many uncontrolled\ndifferences, as well as different outcome metrics. This paper compares the\nperformance of agents using different reward functions in a simulation of a\njunction in Greater Manchester, UK, across various demand profiles, subject to\nreal world constraints: realistic sensor inputs, controllers, calibrated\ndemand, intergreen times and stage sequencing. The reward metrics considered\nare based on the time spent stopped, lost time, change in lost time, average\nspeed, queue length, junction throughput and variations of these magnitudes.\nThe performance of these reward functions is compared in terms of total waiting\ntime. We find that speed maximisation resulted in the lowest average waiting\ntimes across all demand levels, displaying significantly better performance\nthan other rewards previously introduced in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:47:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 16:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-03"}

The\nsecond one is around Igusa's conjecture for exponential sums with bounds in\nterms of the motivic oscillation index.

By\nusing various techniques as the GAGA theorem, resolution of singularities and\nmodel theory, we can answer the third question up to a base field extension.\nNext, by using a transfer principle between non-archimedean local fields of\ncharacteristic zero and positive characteristic, we can link all three\nquestions with a conjecture on weights of $\\ell$-adic cohomology groups of\nArtin-Schreier sheaves associated to jet polynomials.

For instance, an ad could appear below the page fold, where a user never\nscrolls. Yet, an ad is essentially ineffective if it is not at least somewhat\nviewable. Ad viewability - which refers to the pixel percentage-in-view and the\nexposure duration of an online display ad - has recently garnered great\ninterest among digital advertisers and publishers. However, we know very little\nabout the impact of ad viewability on advertising effectiveness. We work to\nclose this gap by analyzing a large-scale observational data set with more than\n350,000 ad impressions similar to the data sets that are typically available to\ndigital advertisers and publishers. This analysis reveals that longer exposure\ndurations (>10 seconds) and 100% visible pixels do not appear to be optimal in\ngenerating view-throughs. The highest view-through rates seem to be generated\nwith relatively lower pixel/second-combinations of 50%/1, 50%/5, 75%/1, and\n75%/5. However, this analysis does not account for user behavior that may be\ncorrelated with or even drive ad viewability and may therefore result in\nendogeneity issues. Consequently, we manipulated ad viewability in a randomized\nonline experiment for a major European news website, finding the highest ad\nrecognition rates among relatively higher pixel/second-combinations of 75%/10,\n100%/5 and 100%/10. Everything below 75\\% or 5 seconds performs worse. Yet, we\nfind that it may be sufficient to have either a long exposure duration or high\npixel percentage-in-view to reach high advertising effectiveness. Our results\nprovide guidance to advertisers enabling them to establish target viewability\nrates more appropriately and to publishers who wish to differentiate their\nviewability products.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 05:49:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

Such schemes can easily be constrained by a limited\namount of training data or over-reliance on an elaborately designed training\nprocess. Inspired by the observation that RGB and depth modalities actually\npresent certain commonality in distinguishing salient objects, a novel joint\nlearning and densely cooperative fusion (JL-DCF) architecture is designed to\nlearn from both RGB and depth inputs through a shared network backbone, known\nas the Siamese architecture. In this paper, we propose two effective\ncomponents: joint learning (JL), and densely cooperative fusion (DCF). The JL\nmodule provides robust saliency feature learning by exploiting cross-modal\ncommonality via a Siamese network, while the DCF module is introduced for\ncomplementary feature discovery. Comprehensive experiments using five popular\nmetrics show that the designed framework yields a robust RGB-D saliency\ndetector with good generalization. As a result, JL-DCF significantly advances\nthe state-of-the-art models by an average of ~2.0% (max F-measure) across seven\nchallenging datasets. In addition, we show that JL-DCF is readily applicable to\nother related multi-modal detection tasks, including RGB-T (thermal infrared)\nSOD and video SOD, achieving comparable or even better performance against\nstate-of-the-art methods. We also link JL-DCF to the RGB-D semantic\nsegmentation field, showing its capability of outperforming several semantic\nsegmentation models on the task of RGB-D SOD.

Improving predictive accuracy is therefore extremely valuable.\nData science researchers design algorithms, models, and approaches to improve\nprediction.

Effective\ndetection of attacks can defend WTNs against discharging contaminated water,\ndenying access, destroying equipment, and causing public fear. While there are\nextensive studies in WTNs attack detection, they only exploit the data\ncharacteristics partially to detect cyber attacks. After preliminary exploring\nthe sensing data of WTNs, we find that integrating spatio-temporal knowledge,\nrepresentation learning, and detection algorithms can improve attack detection\naccuracy. To this end, we propose a structured anomaly detection framework to\ndefend WTNs by modeling the spatio-temporal characteristics of cyber attacks in\nWTNs. In particular, we propose a spatio-temporal representation framework\nspecially tailored to cyber attacks after separating the sensing data of WTNs\ninto a sequence of time segments. This framework has two key components. The\nfirst component is a temporal embedding module to preserve temporal patterns\nwithin a time segment by projecting the time segment of a sensor into a\ntemporal embedding vector. We then construct Spatio-Temporal Graphs (STGs),\nwhere a node is a sensor and an attribute is the temporal embedding vector of\nthe sensor, to describe the state of the WTNs. The second component is a\nspatial embedding module, which learns the final fused embedding of the WTNs\nfrom STGs. In addition, we devise an improved one class-SVM model that utilizes\na new designed pairwise kernel to detect cyber attacks. The devised pairwise\nkernel augments the distance between normal and attack patterns in the fused\nembedding space. Finally, we conducted extensive experimental evaluations with\nreal-world data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

However, most graph analysis tasks are combinatorial optimization\n(CO) problems, which are NP-hard. Recent studies have focused a lot on the\npotential of using machine learning (ML) to solve graph-based CO problems. Most\nrecent methods follow the two-stage framework. The first stage is graph\nrepresentation learning, which embeds the graphs into low-dimension vectors.\nThe second stage uses ML to solve the CO problems using the embeddings of the\ngraphs learned in the first stage. The works for the first stage can be\nclassified into two categories, graph embedding (GE) methods and end-to-end\n(E2E) learning methods. For GE methods, learning graph embedding has its own\nobjective, which may not rely on the CO problems to be solved. The CO problems\nare solved by independent downstream tasks. For E2E learning methods, the\nlearning of graph embeddings does not have its own objective and is an\nintermediate step of the learning procedure of solving the CO problems. The\nworks for the second stage can also be classified into two categories,\nnon-autoregressive methods and autoregressive methods. Non-autoregressive\nmethods predict a solution for a CO problem in one shot. A non-autoregressive\nmethod predicts a matrix that denotes the probability of each node/edge being a\npart of a solution of the CO problem. The solution can be computed from the\nmatrix. Autoregressive methods iteratively extend a partial solution step by\nstep. At each step, an autoregressive method predicts a node/edge conditioned\nto current partial solution, which is used to its extension. In this survey, we\nprovide a thorough overview of recent studies of the graph learning-based CO\nmethods.

The problem exists in applications\nwhere only a subset of sensors are deployed at certain spots or partial\nresponses are collected in field surveys. Existing research mostly focuses on\naddressing incomplete or missing data, e.g., data cleaning and imputation,\nclassification models that allow for missing feature values or model missing\nfeatures as hidden variables in the EM algorithm. These methods, however,\nassume that incomplete feature observations only happen on a small subset of\nsamples, and thus cannot solve problems where the vast majority of samples have\nmissing feature observations. To address this issue, we recently proposed a new\napproach that incorporates physics-aware structural constraint into the model\nrepresentation. Our approach assumes that a spatial contextual feature is\nobserved for all sample locations and establishes spatial structural constraint\nfrom the underlying spatial contextual feature map. We design efficient\nalgorithms for model parameter learning and class inference. This paper extends\nour recent approach by allowing feature values of samples in each class to\nfollow a multi-modal distribution. We propose learning algorithms for the\nextended model with multi-modal distribution. Evaluations on real-world\nhydrological applications show that our approach significantly outperforms\nbaseline methods in classification accuracy, and the multi-modal extension is\nmore robust than our early single-modal version especially when feature\ndistribution in training samples is multi-modal. Computational experiments show\nthat the proposed solution is computationally efficient on large datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 20:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-03"}
