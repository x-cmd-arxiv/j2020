Spreading of diseases has been studied\nextensively under the paradigm of Susceptible - Infected - Recovered - Deceased\n(SIRD) dynamics. Various game-theoretic approaches have also addressed disease\nspread, many of which consider S, I, R, and D as strategies rather than as\nstates. Remarkably, most studies from the above approaches do not account for\nthe distinction between the symptomatic or asymptomatic aspect of the disease.\nIt is well-known that precautionary measures like washing hands, wearing masks\nand social distancing significantly mitigate the spread of many contagious\ndiseases. Herein, we consider the adoption of such precautions as strategies\nand treat S, I, R, and D as states. We also attempt to capture the differences\nin epidemic spreading arising from symptomatic and asymptomatic diseases on\nvarious network topologies. Through extensive computer simulations, we examine\nthat the cost of maintaining precautionary measures as well as the extent of\nmass testing in a population affects the final fraction of socially responsible\nindividuals. We observe that the lack of mass testing could potentially lead to\na pandemic in case of asymptomatic diseases. Network topology also seems to\nplay an important role. We further observe that the final fraction of proactive\nindividuals depends on the initial fraction of both infected as well as\nproactive individuals. Additionally, edge density can significantly influence\nthe overall outcome.

Previously, numerical codes were unable to\nincorporate streaming in this demanding regime, and have never been compared\nagainst analytic solutions. First, we find a new analytic solution highly\ndiscrepant in acceleration efficiency from the standard solution. It arises\nfrom bi-directional streaming of CRs away from the subshock, similar to a\nZeldovich spike in radiative shocks. Since fewer CRs diffuse back upstream,\nthis results in a much lower acceleration efficiency, typically $\\sim 10\\%$ as\nopposed to $\\sim 50\\%$ found in previous analytic work. At Mach number $\\gtrsim\n10$, the new solution bifurcates into 3 branches, with efficient, intermediate\nand inefficient CR acceleration. Our two-moment code (Jiang & Oh 2018)\naccurately recovers these solutions across the entire parameter space probed,\nwith no ad hoc closure relations. For generic initial conditions, the\ninefficient branch is the most robust and preferred solution. The intermediate\nbranch is unstable, while the efficient branch appears only when the\ninefficient branch is not allowed (for CR dominated or high plasma $\\beta$\nshocks). CR modified shocks have very long equilibration times ($\\sim 1000$\ndiffusion time) required to develop the precursor, which must be resolved by\n$\\gtrsim 10$ cells for convergence.

In\nthis setting, cross-validation (CV) serves as an important tool for model\nassessment. Recent advances in approximate cross validation (ACV) provide\naccurate approximations to CV with only a single model fit, avoiding\ntraditional CV's requirement for repeated runs of expensive algorithms.\nUnfortunately, these ACV methods can lose both speed and accuracy in high\ndimensions -- unless sparsity structure is present in the data. Fortunately,\nthere is an alternative type of simplifying structure that is present in most\ndata: approximate low rank (ALR). Guided by this observation, we develop a new\nalgorithm for ACV that is fast and accurate in the presence of ALR data. Our\nfirst key insight is that the Hessian matrix -- whose inverse forms the\ncomputational bottleneck of existing ACV methods -- is ALR. We show that,\ndespite our use of the \\emph{inverse} Hessian, a low-rank approximation using\nthe largest (rather than the smallest) matrix eigenvalues enables fast,\nreliable ACV. Our second key insight is that, in the presence of ALR data,\nerror in existing ACV methods roughly grows with the (approximate, low) rank\nrather than with the (full, high) dimension. These insights allow us to prove\ntheoretical guarantees on the quality of our proposed algorithm -- along with\nfast-to-compute upper bounds on its error. We demonstrate the speed and\naccuracy of our method, as well as the usefulness of our bounds, on a range of\nreal and simulated data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 16:34:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 22:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

However, despite MCT's limitations, the ideal theory also enjoys several\nremarkable successes, notably including the analytical scaling laws for the\n$\\alpha$- and $\\beta$-relaxation dynamics. Here we mathematically derive\nsimilar scaling laws for arbitrary-order multi-point density correlation\nfunctions obtained from GMCT under arbitrary mean-field closure levels.

The validity ranges of the leading-order\nscaling laws are also provided by considering the leading preasymptotic\ncorrections.

Three shortcomings of previous works on light\nspanners are: (i) The runtimes of these constructions are almost always\nsub-optimal and usually far from optimal. (ii) These constructions are optimal\nin the standard and crude sense but not in a refined sense that takes into\naccount a wider range of involved parameters. (iii) The techniques are ad hoc\nper graph class and thus can't be applied broadly.\n  This work aims at addressing these shortcomings by presenting a unified\nframework of light spanners in a variety of graph classes. Informally, the\nframework boils down to a transformation from sparse spanners to light\nspanners; since the state-of-the-art for sparse spanners is much more advanced\nthan that for light spanners, such a transformation is powerful. First, we\napply our framework to design fast constructions with optimal lightness for\nseveral graph classes. Second, we apply our framework to achieve more refined\noptimality bounds for several graph classes, i.e., the bounds remain optimal\nwhen taking into account a wider range of involved parameters, most notably\n$\\epsilon$. Our new constructions are significantly better than the\nstate-of-the-art for every examined graph class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 17:46:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 16:15:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 02:01:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 15:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

By studying the spin texture of surface states, we find the two\nFermi arcs are strongly spin-polarized but in opposite directions, which can be\ndetected by spin-polarized ARPES measurements. Our theoretical study of\nquasiparticle interference (QPI) for a nonmagnetic impurity at the Bi site also\nreveals several features related to the Fermi arcs. Specifically, we predict\nthat the spin polarization of the Fermi arcs leads to a bifurcation-shaped\nfeature only in the spin-dependent QPI spectrum, serving as a fingerprint of\nthe Weyl nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 18:03:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 15:35:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 00:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

This is probably the only viable means to enable\nthe large-scale clinical oncology patient studies that utilize medical imaging.\nDeep learning approaches have shown robust segmentation performances for\ncertain types of tumors, e.g., brain tumors in MRI imaging, when a training\ndataset with plenty of pixel-level fully-annotated tumor images is available.\nHowever, more than often, we are facing the challenge that only (very) limited\nannotations are feasible to acquire, especially for hard tumors.

Previous work\non PDAC segmentation is limited to the moderate amounts of annotated patient\nimages (n<300) from venous or venous+arterial phase CT scans. Based on a new\nself-learning framework, we propose to train the PDAC segmentation model using\na much larger quantity of patients (n~=1,000), with a mix of annotated and\nun-annotated venous or multi-phase CT images. Pseudo annotations are generated\nby combining two teacher models with different PDAC segmentation specialties on\nunannotated images, and can be further refined by a teaching assistant model\nthat identifies associated vessels around the pancreas.

When the data available is directly on the PDF,\nthen there exist methods for inverse problems that can be employed to infer the\ncoefficients and thus determine the FP equation and subsequently obtain its\nsolution.

To this end, we develop a\ngeneral framework based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that\nintroduces a new loss function using the Kullback-Leibler divergence to connect\nthe stochastic samples with the FP equation, to simultaneously learn the\nequation and infer the multi-dimensional PDF at all times.

This study presents a\nhybrid numerical procedure that integrates an upwind total variation\ndiminishing (TVD) finite-difference scheme, which is known for its stability in\nhyperbolic problems, for the polymer stress convection term into an overall\npseudo-spectral numerical framework. Numerically stable solutions are obtained\nfor Weissenberg number well beyond O(100) without the need for either global or\nlocal AD. Side-by-side comparison with an existing pseudo-spectral code reveals\nthe impact of AD, which is shown to differ drastically between flow regimes.\nElastoinertial turbulence (EIT) becomes unphysically suppressed when AD, at any\nlevel necessary for stabilizing the pseudo-spectral method, is used. This is\nattributed to the importance of sharp stress shocks in its self-sustaining\ncycles.

We also show that the\ngenerating series of virtual cobordism classes can be irrational.\n  Given a K-theory class on X of rank r, we associate natural series of virtual\nSegre and Verlinde numbers. We show that the Segre and Verlinde series match in\nthe following three cases: Quot schemes of dimension 0 quotients, Hilbert\nschemes of points and curves over surfaces with p_g>0, Quot schemes of minimal\nelliptic surfaces for quotients supported on fiber classes. Moreover, for\npunctual quotients of the trivial sheaf of rank N, we prove a new symmetry of\nthe Segre/Verlinde series exchanging r and N. The Segre/Verlinde statements\nhave analogues for punctual Quot schemes over curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 19:11:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 02:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

It has a hot\ninterstellar medium and hosts a central dust lane with emission lines. These\ndust lanes are frequent in elliptical galaxies, but the case of NGC 3311 might\nbe particularly interesting for problems of dust lifetime and the role of cool\ngas in the central parts. We aim to use archival HST images and MUSE data to\ninvestigate the central dust structure of NGC 3311. We used the tool PyParadise\nto model the stellar population and extract the emission lines. The HST/ACS\ncolour map reveals the known dust structures, but also blue spots, which are\nplaces of strong line emission. A dusty 'mini-jet' emanates from the centre.\nThe distribution of the emission line gas matches the dust silhouette almost\nexactly. Close to the brightest Halpha emission, the ratio [NII]/Halpha\nresembles that of HII-regions; in the outer parts, [NII] gets stronger and is\nsimilar to LINER-like spectra. The gas kinematics is consistent with that of a\nrotating disc. The Doppler shifts of the strongest line emissions, which\nindicate the areas of highest star formation activity, smoothly fit into the\ndisc symmetry. The metallicity is supersolar. The presence of neutral gas is\nindicated by the fit residuals of the stellar NaI D absorption line, which we\ninterpret as interstellar absorption. We estimate the mass of the neutral gas\nto be of the order of the X-ray mass. The dynamical mass infers a stellar\npopulation of intermediate age, whose globular clusters have already been\nidentified. Our findings can be harmonised in a scenario in which the star\nformation is triggered by the accretion of cold gas onto a pre-existing\ngas/dust disc or ring. Newly produced dust then contributes to the longevity of\nthe dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 19:11:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

A big effort is undergoing with the deployment of many\nground-based, balloon-borne and satellite experiments using different methods\nto separate this faint polarized component from the incoming radiation. One of\nthe largely used technique is the Stokes Polarimetry that uses a rotating\nhalf-wave plate (HWP) and a linear polarizer to separate and modulate the\npolarization components with low residual cross-polarization. This paper\ndescribes the QUBIC Stokes Polarimeter highlighting its design features and its\nperformances. A common systematic with these devices is the generation of large\nspurious signals synchronous with the rotation and proportional to the\nemissivity of the optical elements. A key feature of the QUBIC Stokes\nPolarimeter is to operate at cryogenic temperature in order to minimize this\nunwanted component. Moving efficiently this large optical element at low\ntemperature constitutes a big engineering challenge in order to reduce friction\npower dissipation. Big attention has been given during the designing phase to\nminimize the differential thermal contractions between parts.

At the cores of strong lensing clusters, the Einstein\nradius can be turned into a mass estimate. This efficient method has been\nroutinely used in literature, in lieu of detailed mass models; however, its\nscatter, assumed to be $\\sim30\\%$, has not yet been quantified. Here, we assess\nthis method by testing it against ray-traced images of cluster-scale halos from\nthe Outer Rim N-body cosmological simulation. We measure a scatter of $13.9\\%$\nand a positive bias of $8.8\\%$ in $M(<\\theta_E)$, with no systematic\ncorrelation with total cluster mass, concentration, or lens or source\nredshifts. We find that increased deviation from spherical symmetry increases\nthe scatter; conversely, where the lens produces arcs that cover a large\nfraction of its Einstein circle, both the scatter and the bias decrease. While\nspectroscopic redshifts of the lensed sources are critical for accurate\nmagnifications and time delays, we show that for the purpose of estimating the\ntotal enclosed mass, the scatter introduced by source redshift uncertainty is\nnegligible compared to other sources of error. Finally, we derive and apply an\nempirical correction that eliminates the bias, and reduces the scatter to\n$10.1\\%$ without introducing new correlations with mass, redshifts, or\nconcentration. Our analysis provides the first quantitative assessment of the\nuncertainties in $M(<\\theta_E)$, and enables its effective use as a core mass\nestimator of strong lensing galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 19:48:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

This is the well\nknown phenomenon of spontaneous scalarization (SC) discovered by Damour and\nEsposito-Far\\`ese in 1993. Under such mechanism neutron stars can afford in\nprinciple a maximum mass larger than in general relativity (GR) for a given\nequation of state without taking into account additional observational\nconstraints (e.g. binary systems). This opens the possibility that neutron\nstars might be formed with masses as large as $\\sim 2 M_\\odot$ without the need\nof stiff, or more exotic, equations of state for the nuclear matter. Thus,\nSTT's through SC may account for compact objects with large masses observed\nrecently in the sky in the form of pulsars (PSR J0348+0432 with $M= 2.01 M_\\pm\n0.04\\odot$ observed in 2013, PSR J1614-2230 with $M= 1.97\\pm 0.04 M_\\odot$\nobserved in 2010 or J0740+6620 $M= 2.14^{+0.10}_{-0.09} M_\\odot$ observed in\n2019). However, we argue that even if that was possible such maximum mass\nmodels within STT cannot be formed solely from the dynamic transition of an\ninitial \"isolated\" unscalarized neutron star whose mass cannot exceed the\nmaximum mass in GR. This is because SC, being an energetic-preferred\nconfiguration, produces a final static star with a mass lower that the initial\none with a fixed baryon mass. The mass difference between the initial and final\nconfigurations is radiated away in the form of a scalar-field. Thus, maximum\nmass models of scalarized neutron stars, if present in nature, must have formed\nby a different process, perhaps of cosmological origin or by the subsequent\naccretion of additional scalar charge and mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 20:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

The assignment function $\\phi$ is said to have\nswitching cost at most $k$ if, for every task multiset $T$, changing the\ncontents of $T$ by one task changes $\\phi(T)$ by at most $k$ worker\nassignments. The goal of memoryless worker task assignment is to construct an\nassignment function with the smallest possible switching cost.\n  In past work, the problem of determining the optimal switching cost has been\nposed as an open question.

Thus it is not possible to achieve\na switching cost that is sublinear strictly as a function of $w$.\n  Finally, we present an application of the worker-task assignment problem to a\nmetric embeddings problem.

Leveraging the power of AI and\nInternet of Things (IoT), data-driven automation is reshaping this area.\nHowever, facing its own challenges such as large-scale and heterogenous trucks\nrunning in a highly dynamic environment, it can barely adopt methods developed\nin other domains (e.g., ride-sharing). In this paper, we propose a novel Deep\nReinforcement Learning approach to solve the dynamic dispatching problem in\nmining.

While there\ncould be spatial variation in the deposition rate, this has not yet been\nrigorously quantified, and naively the haze should coat the surface more\nuniformly than was observed. One way (among many) to explain this contradiction\nis for atmospheric pressure at the surface to drop low enough to interrupt haze\nproduction and stop the deposition of particles onto part of the surface,\ndriving heterogeneity. If the surface pressure drops to less than 10^-3 - 10^-4\nmicrobar and the CH4 mixing ratio remains nearly constant at the observed 2015\nvalue, the atmosphere becomes transparent to ultraviolet radiation (Young et\nal., 2018), which would shut off haze production at its source.

The\nmeasurements show a prominent variability in phase with the solar cycle, as\nwell as fluctuations on timescales shorter than a few days. However, the\nmeasurements were done by multiple and usually relatively short-lived missions\nmaking the possible long-term trend in the TSI highly uncertain. While the\nvariability in the UV irradiance is clearly in-phase with the solar cycle, the\nphase of the variability in the visible range has been debated. In this paper,\nwe aim at getting an insight into the long-term trend of TSI since 1996 and the\nphase of the solar irradiance variations in the visible part of the spectrum.\nWe use independent ground-based full-disc photometric observations in Ca~II~K\nand continuum from the Rome and San Fernando observatories to compute the TSI\nsince 1996. We follow the empirical San Fernando approach based on the\nphotometric sum index. We find a weak declining trend in the TSI of\n-7.8$^{+4.9}_{-0.8}\\times10^{-3}$ Wm$^{-2}$y$^{-1}$ between the 1996 and 2008\nactivity minima, while between 2008 and 2019 the reconstructed TSI shows no\ntrend to a marginally decreasing (but statistically insignificant) trend of\n-0.1$^{+0.25}_{-0.02}\\times10^{-3}$ Wm$^{-2}$y$^{-1}$. The reference TSI series\nused for the reconstruction does not significantly affect the determined trend.\nThe variation in the blue continuum (409.2 nm) is rather flat, while the\nvariation in the red continuum (607.1 nm) is marginally in anti-phase, although\nthis result is extremely sensitive to the accurate assessment of the quiet Sun\nlevel in the images. These results provide further insights into the long-term\nvariation of the total solar irradiance. The amplitude of the variations in the\nvisible is below the uncertainties of the processing, which prevents an\nassessment of the phase of the variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 22:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

The produced pi0 is emitted 180 degrees\nopposite to the virtual-photon momentum. This study also aims to apply the\nwell-known Rosenbluth separation technique that provides the model-independent\ndifferential cross-sections at the never explored u-channel kinematics region.\nCurrently, the \"soft-hard transition\" in u-channel meson production remains an\ninteresting and unexplored subject. The available theoretical frameworks offer\ncompeting interpretations for the observed backward-angle cross section peaks.\nIn a \"soft\" hadronic Regge exchange description, the backward meson production\ncomes from the interference between nucleon exchange and the meson produced via\nre-scattering within the nucleon. Whereas in the \"hard\" GPD-like backward\ncollinear factorization regime, the scattering amplitude factorizes into a hard\nsubprocess amplitude and baryon to meson transition distribution amplitudes\n(TDAs), otherwise known as super skewed parton distributions (SuperSPDs). Both\nTDAs and SPDs are universal non-perturbative objects of nucleon structure\naccessible only through backward-angle kinematics. The separated cross\nsections:sigma_T,sigma_L and T/L ratio at Q2=2-6 GeV2, provide a direct test of\ntwo predictions from the TDA model. The magnitude and u-dependence of the\nseparated cross sections also provide a direct connection to the re-scattering\nRegge picture. The extracted interaction radius (from u-dependence) at\ndifferent Q2 can be used to study the soft-hard transition in the u-channel\nkinematics. The acquisition of these data will be an important step forward in\nvalidating the existence of a backward factorization scheme of the nucleon\nstructure function and establishing its applicable kinematic range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 01:02:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 15:21:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-02"}

Previous UDA methods assume that the source and target\ndomains share an identical label space, which is unrealistic in practice since\nthe label information of the target domain is agnostic. This paper focuses on a\nmore realistic UDA scenario, i.e. partial domain adaptation (PDA), where the\ntarget label space is subsumed to the source label space. In the PDA scenario,\nthe source outliers that are absent in the target domain may be wrongly matched\nto the target domain (technically named negative transfer), leading to\nperformance degradation of UDA methods. This paper proposes a novel Target\nDomain Specific Classifier Learning-based Domain Adaptation (TSCDA) method.\nTSCDA presents a soft-weighed maximum mean discrepancy criterion to partially\nalign feature distributions and alleviate negative transfer. Also, it learns a\ntarget-specific classifier for the target domain with pseudo-labels and\nmultiple auxiliary classifiers, to further address classifier shift. A module\nnamed Peers Assisted Learning is used to minimize the prediction difference\nbetween multiple target-specific classifiers, which makes the classifiers more\ndiscriminant for the target domain.

Classical model-based methods and recent deep learning (DL)-based\nmethods represent two different methodologies for this problem, each with their\nown merits and drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a novel blind image\nrestoration method, aiming to integrate both the advantages of them.\nSpecifically, we construct a general Bayesian generative model for the blind\nIR, which explicitly depicts the degradation process. In this proposed model, a\npixel-wise non-i.i.d. Gaussian distribution is employed to fit the image noise.\nIt is with more flexibility than the simple i.i.d. Gaussian or Laplacian\ndistributions as adopted in most of conventional methods, so as to handle more\ncomplicated noise types contained in the image degradation. To solve the model,\nwe design a variational inference algorithm where all the expected posteriori\ndistributions are parameterized as deep neural networks to increase their model\ncapability. Notably, such an inference algorithm induces a unified framework to\njointly deal with the tasks of degradation estimation and image restoration.\nFurther, the degradation information estimated in the former task is utilized\nto guide the latter IR process. Experiments on two typical blind IR tasks,\nnamely image denoising and super-resolution, demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 03:30:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 08:38:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 12:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

Federated\nLearning(FL) is a newly developed privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm\nto bridge data repositories without compromising data security and privacy.\nThus many federated recommendation(FedRec) algorithms have been proposed to\nrealize personalized privacy-preserving recommendations.

We show that the number of\nbinary black hole mergers agrees with the prediction based on clusters' initial\nproperties when the IMBH mass is not massive enough or the IMBH seed forms at a\nlater time.

Most strikingly a\nresistivity peak appears at high temperatures near superlattice filling factor\nnu = -1, despite no signs of a commensurate correlated phase appearing in the\nlow-temperature limit. Tilted field magnetotransport and thermodynamic\nmeasurements of the inplane magnetic moment show that the resistivity peak is\nadiabatically connected to a finite-field magnetic phase transition at which\nthe system develops finite isospin polarization. These data are suggestive of a\nPomeranchuk-type mechanism, in which the entropy of disordered isospin moments\nin the ferromagnetic phase stabilizes it relative to an isospin unpolarized\nFermi liquid phase at elevated temperatures.

However,\ndue to the sparsity of the depth data, the standard convolution operation,\nexploited by most of existing methods, is not effective to model the observed\ncontexts with depth values. To address this issue, we propose to adopt the\ngraph propagation to capture the observed spatial contexts. Specifically, we\nfirst construct multiple graphs at different scales from observed pixels. Since\nthe graph structure varies from sample to sample, we then apply the attention\nmechanism on the propagation, which encourages the network to model the\ncontextual information adaptively.

Consider a VLC\nsystem, where two entrusted users close to a VLC access point (AP) help an\nout-of-coverage legitimate user using RF signals in the presence of an\neavesdropper.

We introduce the\nheterogeneous mean-field (HMF) approach in a multiplex network setting to\njointly model the spreading dynamics of the infectious disease in the contact\nnetwork and the dissemination dynamics of information in the observation\nnetwork. The disease spreading is captured using the classic\nsusceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) process, while an SIS-alike process\nmodels the spread of awareness termed as unaware-aware-unaware (UAU). And the\nuse of multiplex network helps capture the interplay between disease spreading\nand information dissemination, and how the dynamics of one may affect the\nother.

The target network is for smoothly generating\nthe reference signals for a main network in DRL, thereby reducing learning\nvariance. The problem with its conventional update rule is the fact that all\nthe parameters are smoothly copied with the same speed from the main network,\neven when some of them are trying to update toward the wrong directions. This\nbehavior increases the risk of generating the wrong reference signals. Although\nslowing down the overall update speed is a naive way to mitigate wrong updates,\nit would decrease learning speed. To robustly update the parameters while\nkeeping learning speed, a t-soft update method, which is inspired by student-t\ndistribution, is derived with reference to the analogy between the exponential\nmoving average and the normal distribution. Through the analysis of the derived\nt-soft update, we show that it takes over the properties of the student-t\ndistribution. Specifically, with a heavy-tailed property of the student-t\ndistribution, the t-soft update automatically excludes extreme updates that\ndiffer from past experiences. In addition, when the updates are similar to the\npast experiences, it can mitigate the learning delay by increasing the amount\nof updates. In PyBullet robotics simulations for DRL, an online actor-critic\nalgorithm with the t-soft update outperformed the conventional methods in terms\nof the obtained return and/or its variance.

Due to the four multi-stable\nstructures with low defect formation energies, the defect density of Pb\ninterstitials is expected to be ~5.6 times larger than previous predictions\nwhen PbTe is synthesized at 900 K. In contrast to the on-centered\nPbinterstitial, the off-centered Pb interstitials in PbTe can exhibit\nlong-range lattice relaxation toward [111] direction beyond distance of 1 nm,\nindicating the potential formation of weak local dipoles.

A typical scenario is the domain drift, i.e.\ndifferent domains of data come one after another, where the MRC model is\nrequired to adapt to the new domain while maintaining previously learned\nability.

They have a wide range of applications to help either the elderly\nand disabled to walk or to treat certain illnesses or for post-operative\nrehabilitation. But there are many different types of crutches, including\nshoulder crutches and elbow crutches. How to choose has become an issue that\ndeserves to be debated. Because while crutches help people walk, they also have\nan impact on the body. Inappropriate choice of crutches or long-term misuse can\nlead to problems such as scoliosis. Previous studies were mainly experimental\nmeasurements or the construction of dynamic models to calculate the load on\njoints with crutches. These studies focus only on the level of the joints,\nignoring the role that muscles play in this process. Although some also take\ninto account the degree of muscle activation, there is still a lack of\nquantitative analysis. The traditional dynamic model can be used to calculate\nthe load on each joint. However, due to the activation of the muscle, this\nsituation only causes part of the load transmitted to the joint, and the work\nof the chair will compensate the other part of the load. Analysis at the muscle\nlevel allows a better understanding of the impact of crutches on the body. By\ncomparing the levels of activation of the trunk muscles, it was found that the\nuse of crutches for walking, especially a single crutch, can cause a large\ndifference in the activation of the back muscles on the left and right sides,\nand this difference will cause muscle degeneration for a long time, leading to\nscoliosis. In this article taking scoliosis as an example, by analyzing the\nmuscles around the spine, we can better understand the pathology and can better\nprevent diseases. The objective of this article is to analyze normal walking\ncompared to walking with one or two crutches using OpenSim software to obtain\nthe degree of activation of different muscles in order to analyze the impact of\ncrutches on the body.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 08:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Many\ndifferent tasks have been proposed for understanding users' search queries,\ne.g., query classification or query clustering. However, it is not that precise\nto understand a search query at the intent class/cluster level due to the loss\nof many detailed information. As we may find in many benchmark datasets, e.g.,\nTREC and SemEval, queries are often associated with a detailed description\nprovided by human annotators which clearly describes its intent to help\nevaluate the relevance of the documents. If a system could automatically\ngenerate a detailed and precise intent description for a search query, like\nhuman annotators, that would indicate much better query understanding has been\nachieved. In this paper, therefore, we propose a novel\nQuery-to-Intent-Description (Q2ID) task for query understanding. Unlike those\nexisting ranking tasks which leverage the query and its description to compute\nthe relevance of documents, Q2ID is a reverse task which aims to generate a\nnatural language intent description based on both relevant and irrelevant\ndocuments of a given query. To address this new task, we propose a novel\nContrastive Generation model, namely CtrsGen for short, to generate the intent\ndescription by contrasting the relevant documents with the irrelevant documents\ngiven a query. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by comparing with\nseveral state-of-the-art generation models on the Q2ID task.

Realizing that the\ndemon contributes not only to the system but also to the environments, we\nintroduce the dissipative information to quantify the total contribution of the\ndemon, rather than using an improper entropy production. We prove a set of new\nfluctuation theorems based on this, which can be used to uncover the truth\nbehind the demon: The controlled system does not violate the 2nd law at any\ncoarse-grained level for the demon's control. However, there exists an\ninevitable demon-induced dissipative information which always increases the\nentropy production. A consequence of these theorems is that, less work and more\nheat can be extracted and generated respectively by a demon than the limits\npredicted by the Ueda-Sagawa theorem.

The central hypothesis of the study is that the three text\ntypes (non-literary, literary/canonical and literary/non-canonical) exhibit\nsystematic differences with respect to structural design features as correlates\nof aesthetic responses in readers. To investigate these differences, we\ncompiled a corpus containing texts of the three categories of interest, the\nJena Textual Aesthetics Corpus. Two aspects of global structure are\ninvestigated, variability and self-similar (fractal) patterns, which reflect\nlong-range correlations along texts. We use four types of basic observations,\n(i) the frequency of POS-tags per sentence, (ii) sentence length, (iii) lexical\ndiversity in chunks of text, and (iv) the distribution of topic probabilities\nin chunks of texts. These basic observations are grouped into two more general\ncategories, (a) the low-level properties (i) and (ii), which are observed at\nthe level of the sentence (reflecting linguistic decoding), and (b) the\nhigh-level properties (iii) and (iv), which are observed at the textual level\n(reflecting comprehension). The basic observations are transformed into time\nseries, and these time series are subject to multifractal detrended fluctuation\nanalysis (MFDFA). Our results show that low-level properties of texts are\nbetter discriminators than high-level properties, for the three text types\nunder analysis.

In a recent publication (arXiv:1709.05075 [physics.chem-ph]), Hait\nand Head-Gordon took a first step in this regard by providing recommendations\non the best density functionals suitable for these purposes. However, no\nextensive study has been performed to provide recommendations on the basis set\nchoice. Here, we shed some light into this matter by evaluating the performance\nof 38 general-purpose basis sets of single up to triple zeta-quality, when\ncoupled with nine different levels of theory, in the computation of dipole\nmoments. The calculations were performed on a data set with 114 small molecules\ncontaining second- and third-row elements. We based our analysis in regularised\nroot mean square errors (regularised RMSE) as this procedure ensures relative\nerrors for ionic species and absolute errors for species with small dipole\nmoment values. Our results indicate that the best compromise between accuracy\nand computational efficiency is achieved by performing the computations with an\naugmented double zeta-quality basis set (i.e. aug-pc-1, aug-pcseg-1,\naug-cc-pVDZ) together with a hybrid functional (e.g. wB97X-V, SOGGA11-X).\nAugmented triple-zeta basis sets could enhance the accuracy of the\ncomputations, but the computational cost of introducing such a basis set is\nsubstantial compared with the small improvement provided.

These are complete extensions of\nsome results by Aizenman-Simon and the recent results by the second named\nauthor in the framework of Brownian motions on Euclidean space. We further give\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for a Radon measure with Ahlfors regularity\nto belong to $L^p$-Kato class. Our results can be applicable to many examples,\nfor instance, symmetric (relativistic) stable processes, jump processes on\n$d$-sets, Brownian motions on Riemannian manifolds, diffusions on fractals and\nso on.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 10:45:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 14:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

Moreover, we find five new\nphases for $\\Gamma\\ne 0$ which are elaborated by both the quantum and classical\nnumerical methods. Part of the space previously identified as 120$^\\circ$\nN\\'{e}el phase in the classical study is found to give way to the modulated\nstripe phase. Depending on the sign of the $\\Gamma$, the FM-A phase transits\ninto the FM-B ($\\Gamma>0$) and FM-C ($\\Gamma<0$) phase with different spin\norientations, and the stripe-B phase transits into the stripe-C ($\\Gamma>0$)\nand stripe-A ($\\Gamma<0$). Around the positive $\\Gamma$ point, due to the\ninterplay of the Heisenberg, Kiatev and $\\Gamma$ interactions, we find a\npossible quantum spin liquid with a continuum in spin excitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 13:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

The power at the null frequency is used as a\nfigure of merit. Using a genetic algorithm, I then optimise the figure of merit\nby adjusting the location of the dipole frequencies in the power spectrum}.\nUsing published frequencies, I compare the asymptotic dipole mode frequencies\nwith published frequencies. I also used published frequencies for deriving\ncoupling factor and dipole period spacing using a non-linear least squares fit.\nI use Monte-Carlo simulations of the non-linear least square fit for deriving\nerror bars for each parameters.

The period spacing and coupling\nfactors of mixed modes in subgiants are confirmed.

Numerous approaches have been proposed,\nwhich allow to perform extended simulations of large systems at a small\nfraction of the computational costs of electronic structure calculations. The\nkey to the success of modern ML potentials is the close-to first principles\nquality description of the atomic interactions. This accuracy is reached by\nusing very flexible functional forms in combination with high-level reference\ndata from electronic structure calculations. These data sets can include up to\nhundreds of thousands of structures covering millions of atomic environments to\nensure that all relevant features of the potential energy surface are well\nrepresented.

Examples are the comparison of local atomic\nenvironments to identify and avoid unnecessary redundant information in the\nreference data sets that is costly in terms of both the electronic structure\ncalculations as well as the training process, the assessment of the quality of\nthe descriptors used as structural fingerprints in many types of ML potentials,\nand the detection of possibly unreliable data points.

Therefore,\nthere is another type of attribute that contains both QI values and sensitive\nvalues, namely, semi-sensitive attribute. Based on such observation, we propose\na new anonymization technique, called local generalization and bucketization,\nto prevent identity disclosure and protect the sensitive values on each\nsemi-sensitive attribute and sensitive attribute. The rationale is to use local\ngeneralization and local bucketization to divide the tuples into local\nequivalence groups and partition the sensitive values into local buckets,\nrespectively. The protections of local generalization and local bucketization\nare independent, so that they can be implemented by appropriate algorithms\nwithout weakening other protection, respectively. Besides, the protection of\nlocal bucketization for each semi-sensitive attribute and sensitive attribute\nis also independent.

The intrinsic unequal relationships of such kind,\nhowever, are opaque or hidden in numerous real systems. For instance, when a\nnode in a network with limited interaction capacity spends its capacity to its\nneighboring nodes, the allocation of the total amount of interactions to them\ncan be vastly diverse. Even if such potentially heterogeneous interactions\nepitomized by weighted networks are observable, as a result of the\naforementioned ego-centric allocation of interactions, the relative importance\nor dependency between two interacting nodes can only be implicitly accessible.\nIn this work, we precisely pinpoint such relative dependency by proposing the\nframework to discover hidden dependent relations extracted from weighted\nnetworks. For a given weighted network, we provide a systematic criterion to\nselect the most essential interactions for individual nodes based on the\nconcept of information entropy. The criterion is symbolized by assigning the\neffective number of neighbors or the effective out-degree to each node, and the\nresultant directed subnetwork decodes the hidden dependent relations by leaving\nonly the most essential directed interactions. We apply our methodology to two\ntime-stamped empirical network data, namely the international trade relations\nbetween nations in the world trade web (WTW) and the network of people in the\nhistorical record of Korea, Annals of the Joseon Dynasty (AJD). Based on the\ndata analysis, we discover that the properties of mutual dependency encoded in\nthe two systems are vastly different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 14:18:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:00:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 23:11:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 23:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

Though remarkable\nprogress has been achieved, we observe that the closer the pixel is to the\nedge, the more difficult it is to be predicted, because edge pixels have a very\nimbalance distribution. To address this problem, we propose a label decoupling\nframework (LDF) which consists of a label decoupling (LD) procedure and a\nfeature interaction network (FIN). LD explicitly decomposes the original\nsaliency map into body map and detail map, where body map concentrates on\ncenter areas of objects and detail map focuses on regions around edges. Detail\nmap works better because it involves much more pixels than traditional edge\nsupervision. Different from saliency map, body map discards edge pixels and\nonly pays attention to center areas. This successfully avoids the distraction\nfrom edge pixels during training. Therefore, we employ two branches in FIN to\ndeal with body map and detail map respectively. Feature interaction (FI) is\ndesigned to fuse the two complementary branches to predict the saliency map,\nwhich is then used to refine the two branches again. This iterative refinement\nis helpful for learning better representations and more precise saliency maps.\nComprehensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LDF\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches on different evaluation metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 14:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

We consider star-simple\ndrawings of $K_n$ with no empty lens. In this setting we prove an upper bound\nof $3((n-4)!)$ on the maximum number of crossings between any pair of edges. It\nfollows that the total number of crossings is finite and upper bounded by $n!$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 14:34:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

This communication often takes place through deployment\ndiagrams of a system under development. However, it is common diagrams to\nbecome ambiguous or inconsistent as the system progresses and goes to a\ncontinuous delivery pipeline or production. Moreover, diagrams could not follow\nthe evolution of systems, and it is challenging to associate diagrams to\nproduction. In this paper, we propose the use of system descriptors to address\nthe ambiguity of deployment diagrams. We state three main hypotheses (1) if a\ndeployment diagram is generated from a valid system descriptor then the diagram\nis unambiguous; (2) if a valid system descriptor is generated from a deployment\ndiagram then the descriptor is unambiguous; (3) if a diagram $\\mu$ generated\nfrom a descriptor $A$ is unambiguous and if a descriptor $B$ is generated from\nthe diagram $\\mu$ equally unambiguous then descriptors $A$ and $B$ are\nequivalent. We report a case study to test our hypotheses. We constructed a\nsystem descriptor from Netflix deployment diagram, and we applied our tool to\ngenerate a new deployment diagram. Finally, we compare the original and\ngenerated diagrams to evaluate our proposal. Our case study shows the generated\ndeployment diagrams are graphically equivalent to system descriptors and\neliminated ambiguous aspects of the original diagram. Thus, our preliminary\nresults lead to further evaluation in controlled and empirical experiments to\ntest our hypotheses conclusively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 14:37:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 13:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-05"}

Although phonon confinement and depletion effects have been\nconsidered, it should be emphasized that surface-localized phonons (surface\nphonons) arise whose influence on heat conduction may not be negligible due to\nthe high surface-to-volume ratio. However, the role of surface phonons in heat\nconduction has received little attention thus far.

According to the 2001 National Household Travel Survey, about one half\nof weekday U.S. workers made a stop during their commute. In excess commuting\nstudies that examine a region's overall commuting efficiency, commuting is,\nhowever, simplified as nonstop travel from homes to jobs. This research fills\nthis gap by proposing a trip-chaining-based model to integrate trip-chaining\nbehavior into excess commuting. Based on a case study of the Tampa Bay region\nof Florida, this research finds that traditional excess commuting studies\nunderestimate both actual and optimal commute, while overestimate excess\ncommuting. For chained commuting trips alone, for example, the mean minimum\ncommute time is increased by 70 percent from 5.48 minutes to 9.32 minutes after\ntrip-chaining is accounted for. The gaps are found to vary across trip-chaining\ntypes by a disaggregate analysis by types of chain activities. Hence,\npolicymakers and planners are cautioned of omitting trip-chaining behavior in\nmaking urban transportation and land use policies. In addition, the proposed\nmodel can be adopted to study the efficiency of non-work travel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 14:54:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

However, in addition to the\nstandard classification or regression problems, in bioinformatics, we often\nneed to predict more complex structured targets, such as 2D images and 3D\nmolecular structures. The above complex prediction tasks are referred to as\nstructured prediction. Structured prediction is more complicated than the\ntraditional classification but has much broader applications, considering that\nmost of the original bioinformatics problems have complex output objects. Due\nto the properties of those structured prediction problems, such as having\nproblem-specific constraints and dependency within the labeling space, the\nstraightforward application of existing deep learning models can lead to\nunsatisfactory results. Here, we argue that the following ideas can help\nresolve structured prediction problems in bioinformatics.

Secondly, we\ncan design the problem-specific deep learning architectures or methods by\nconsidering the structured labeling space and problem constraints, either\nexplicitly or implicitly. We demonstrate our ideas with six projects from four\nbioinformatics subfields, including sequencing analysis, structure prediction,\nfunction annotation, and network analysis. The structured outputs cover 1D\nsignals, 2D images, 3D structures, hierarchical labeling, and heterogeneous\nnetworks. With the help of the above ideas, all of our methods can achieve SOTA\nperformance on the corresponding problems. The success of these projects\nmotivates us to extend our work towards other more challenging but important\nproblems, such as health-care problems, which can directly benefit people's\nhealth and wellness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 02:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

These ingredients are standard, taken from the statistical theory\nof polymers, and used in most micromechanical polymer network and soft tissue\nmodels.\n  The affinity assumption imposes a constraint in the network which results in\nan anisotropic distribution of the orientation of the chains and, hence, in an\nadditional configurational entropy that should be included.

Critical questions about when and why patients\nrespond to treatment or stay ill, what kinds of treatments are effective, and\neven how to properly diagnose the disease remain largely unanswered. We\ninvestigate these questions by applying machine learning techniques to a large\nscale Lyme disease patient registry, MyLymeData, developed by the nonprofit\nLymeDisease.org. We apply various machine learning methods in order to measure\nthe effect of individual features in predicting participants' answers to the\nGlobal Rating of Change (GROC) survey questions that assess the self-reported\ndegree to which their condition improved, worsened, or remained unchanged\nfollowing antibiotic treatment. We use basic linear regression, support vector\nmachines, neural networks, entropy-based decision tree models, and $k$-nearest\nneighbors approaches. We first analyze the general performance of the model and\nthen identify the most important features for predicting participant answers to\nGROC. After we identify the \"key\" features, we separate them from the dataset\nand demonstrate the effectiveness of these features at identifying GROC. In\ndoing so, we highlight possible directions for future study both mathematically\nand clinically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 22:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

Because demand can exceed\ncapacity at different areas and across different times of the day, drivers have\nto refuse passenger boardings at specific stops. Towards this goal, many public\ntransport operators have modified their service routes by avoiding to serve\nstops with high passenger demand at specific times of the day. Given the urgent\nneed to develop decision support tools that can prevent the overcrowding of\nvehicles, this study introduces a dynamic integer nonlinear program that\nproposes service patterns to individual vehicles that are ready to be\ndispatched. In addition to the objective of satisfying the imposed vehicle\ncapacity due to COVID-19, the proposed service pattern model caters for the\nwaiting time of passengers. Our model is tested in a bus line connecting the\nuniversity of Twente with its surrounding cities demonstrating the improvement\nin terms of vehicle overcrowding, and analyzing the potential negative effects\nrelated to unserved passenger demand and excessive waiting times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 17:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

In this study, we\npropose multiple alternative methods to the Conventional Shannon Entropy land\nuse mix index, which is generally employed to measure land use diversity. The\nstudy attempted to measure land use mix from two new perspectives and test the\nperformance of the new measures with economic, transportation, and social\noutcomes. We first offered an improved single measure, entropy-based land use\nmix index weighted by adding surrounding land use attributes and the regional\nland use context to mitigate the modifiable area unit problem (MAUP) and equal\ncomposition issue. Second, we designed a multi-measure method to describe land\nuse patterns via clustering. We found that the new single measure method is\nmore effective than the existing Conventional Shannon Entropy index in\naccurately delivering the vision of land use mix that Jane Jacobs originally\nproposed. We also found the multi-measure clustering method performed much\nbetter in the regression model on various effect variables, compared with both\nconventional and other new index. Upon further review, we found that land use\npattern complexity's relationship with various outcomes makes a single\ndefinition measure very difficult to represent true land use fully. Therefore,\nwe recommend that future research measure whether or not land use is mixed to\nthen assess land use pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 14:54:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}
