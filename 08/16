It was\nsuggested since three decades ago that all \"additive\" or \"translational\" shape\ninvariant superpotentials formed by two combination of functions have been\nfound and their list was already exhausted by the well-known exactly solvable\npotentials that are available in most textbooks and furthermore, there are no\nothers. We have devised a new family of superpotentials formed by a linear\ncombination of three functions (two monomials and one rational) and where the\nchange of parameter function is linear in four parameters. This new family of\npotentials with superpotential $W(x,A,B,D,G) = Ax^3 + Bx -\\frac{Dx}{1+Gx^2}$\nwill extend the list of exactly solvable Schr\\\"odinger equations. We have shown\nthat the energy of the bound states is rational in the quantum number.\nFurthermore, approximating the potential around the central well by a harmonic\noscillator, as a usual practice, is not valid. The two outer wells affect\nnoticeably the probability density distribution of the excited states. We have\nnoticed that the populations of the triple-well potentials are localized in the\ntwo outer wells. These results have potential applications to explore more\nphysical phenomena such as tunneling effect, and instantons dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 22:19:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 02:24:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 14:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

The rules are derived by using first the spline\nquasi-interpolation approach to approximate such function and then the\nextension of a well known algorithm for spline product to the bivariate\nsetting. In this way efficiency is ensured, since the locality of any spline\nquasi-interpolation scheme is combined with the capability of an ad--hoc\ntreatment of the B-spline factor.

This code addresses the\ndifferences among observers by using a self-consistent statistical approach,\nleading to a sharper lightcurve, and improving the precision of the measured\nslopes. To first order, the comet's lightcurve approximately follows a r$^{-4}$\nresponse for both pre- and post-perihelion distances.

In contrast to earlier interpretations, the\nbelow-bandgap OKE responses in both hybrid CH3NH3PbBr3 and all-inorganic\nCsPbBr3 perovskites are found to originate from strong hyperpolarizability and\nhighly anisotropic dispersions.

Additionally,\nbelow the band edge a ring-shaped minimum, located between the two maxima, is\nfound to further enhance the thermoelectric performance but only with the DOS\nscattering model. This comes from a sharp drop in the DOS, and thus scattering,\njust below the ring-shaped minimum.

The relative drift of\nthe reflected ions versus the electrons triggers an electron cyclotron drift\ninstability (ECDI) which excites the first ES wave. Because the bulk velocity\nof gyro-reflected ions shifts to the direction of the shock front, the\nresulting ES wave propagates oblique to the shock normal. Immediately, a\nfraction of incident electrons are accelerated by this ES wave and a ring-like\nvelocity distribution is generated.

(2) from\nthe middle of the foot all the way to the ramp, electrons can couple with both\nincident and reflected ions. ES waves excited by ECDI in different directions\npropagate across each other.

The main idea of recent fast ReID methods is the hashing algorithm,\nwhich learns compact binary codes and performs fast Hamming distance and\ncounting sort. However, a very long code is needed for high accuracy (e.g.\n2048), which compromises search speed. In this work, we introduce a new\nsolution for fast ReID by formulating a novel Coarse-to-Fine (CtF) hashing code\nsearch strategy, which complementarily uses short and long codes, achieving\nboth faster speed and better accuracy. It uses shorter codes to coarsely rank\nbroad matching similarities and longer codes to refine only a few top\ncandidates for more accurate instance ReID. Specifically, we design an\nAll-in-One (AiO) framework together with a Distance Threshold Optimization\n(DTO) algorithm. In AiO, we simultaneously learn and enhance multiple codes of\ndifferent lengths in a single model. It learns multiple codes in a pyramid\nstructure, and encourage shorter codes to mimic longer codes by\nself-distillation. DTO solves a complex threshold search problem by a simple\noptimization process, and the balance between accuracy and speed is easily\ncontrolled by a single parameter. It formulates the optimization target as a\n$F_{\\beta}$ score that can be optimised by Gaussian cumulative distribution\nfunctions. Experimental results on 2 datasets show that our proposed method\n(CtF) is not only 8% more accurate but also 5x faster than contemporary hashing\nReID methods. Compared with non-hashing ReID methods, CtF is $50\\times$ faster\nwith comparable accuracy.

Despite its intensive usage, the LT\nmodel suffers several limitations in describing the time evolution of the\nspreading. First, the discrete-time step that captures the speed of the\nspreading is vaguely defined. Second, the synchronous updating rule makes the\nnodes infected in batches, which can not take individual differences into\naccount. Finally, the LT model is incompatible with existing models for the\nsimple contagion. Here we consider a generalized linear threshold (GLT) model\nfor the continuous-time stochastic complex contagion process that can be\nefficiently implemented by the Gillespie algorithm. The time in this model has\na clear mathematical definition and the updating order is rigidly defined. We\nfind that the traditional LT model systematically underestimates the spreading\nspeed and the randomness in the spreading sequence order. We also show that the\nGLT model works seamlessly with the susceptible-infected (SI) or\nsusceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. One can easily combine them to\nmodel a hybrid spreading process in which simple contagion accumulates the\ncritical mass for the complex contagion that leads to the global cascades.\nOverall, the GLT model we proposed can be a useful tool to study complex\ncontagion, especially when studying the time evolution of the spreading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 04:03:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

The goal of manifold learning is to reduce these observations\nas a compact lower-dimensional representation based on the geometric\ninformation. The reduction procedure is called the spectral manifold learning.\nIn this paper, we derive each spectral manifold learning with the matrix and\noperator representation, and we then discuss the convergence behavior of each\nmethod in a geometric uniform language.

However, out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs pose a great challenge to\nDNNs and consequently represent a major risk when DNNs are implemented in\nsafety-critical systems. Extensive research has been performed in the domain of\nOOD detection. However, current state-of-the-art methods for OOD detection\nsuffer from at least one of the following limitations: (1) increased inference\ntime - this limits existing methods' applicability to many real-world\napplications, and (2) the need for OOD training data - such data can be\ndifficult to acquire and may not be representative enough, thus limiting the\nability of the OOD detector to generalize. In this paper, we propose FOOD --\nFast Out-Of-Distribution detector -- an extended DNN classifier capable of\nefficiently detecting OOD samples with minimal inference time overhead. Our\narchitecture features a DNN with a final Gaussian layer combined with the log\nlikelihood ratio statistical test and an additional output neuron for OOD\ndetection. Instead of using real OOD data, we use a novel method to craft\nartificial OOD samples from in-distribution data, which are used to train our\nOOD detector neuron.

For applications,\nwe compute the exact ground state energy of Ising spin glasses on square\nlattice up to 1024 spins, on cubic lattice up to 216 spins, and on 3 regular\nrandom graphs up to 220 spins, on a single GPU; We obtain exact ground state\nenergy of (+/-)J Ising spin glass on the chimera graph of D-Wave quantum\nannealer of 512 qubits in less than 100 seconds and investigate the exact value\nof the residual entropy of (+/-)J spin glasses on the chimera graph; Finally,\nwe investigate ground-state energy and entropy of 3-state Potts glasses on\nsquare lattices up to size 18 x 18. Our approach provides baselines and\nbenchmarks for exact algorithms for spin glasses and combinatorial optimization\nproblems, and for evaluating heuristic algorithms and mean-field theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 11:50:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:18:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

For such\nscenarios, group communication in the form of multicasting and broadcasting has\nproven to be effective. Group Key Management (GKM) involves the handling,\nrevocation, updation and distribution of cryptographic keys to members of\nvarious groups. Classical GKM schemes perform inefficiently in dynamic IoT\nenvironments, which are those wherein nodes frequently leave or join a network\nor migrate from one group to another over time. Recently, the `GroupIt' scheme\nhas been proposed for GKM in dynamic IoT environments. However, this scheme has\nseveral limitations such as vulnerability to collusion attacks, the use of\ncomputationally expensive asymmetric encryption and threats to the backward\nsecrecy of the system. In this paper, we present a highly efficient and secure\nGKM protocol for dynamic IoT settings, which maintains forward and backward\nsecrecy at all times. Our proposed protocol uses only symmetric encryption, and\nis completely resistant to collusion attacks. Also, our protocol is highly\nflexible and can handle several new scenarios in which device or user dynamics\nmay take place, e.g., allowing a device group to join or leave the network or\ncreation or dissolution of a user group, which are not handled by schemes\nproposed in prior literature. We evaluate the performance of the proposed\nprotocol via extensive mathematical analysis and numerical computations, and\nshow that it outperforms the GroupIt scheme in terms of the communication and\ncomputation costs incurred by users and devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 11:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

In this conventional picture, they must still show strong\ncircumstellar extinction caused by the dust ejected during the AGB phase, and\nthe extinction is expected to decrease over time because of the dispersal of\nthe circumstellar dust after the cessation of the stellar mass loss. The\nreduction of the extinction makes the stars become apparently brighter and\nbluer with time especially in the near-infrared (NIR) range. We look for such\nlong-term brightening of non-variable OH/IR stars by using 2MASS, UKIDSS, and\nOAOWFC survey data. As a result, we get multi-epoch NIR data taken over a\n20-year period (1997-2017) for 6 of 16 non-variable OH/IR stars, and all six\nobjects are found to be brightening. The K-band brightening rate of five\nobjects ranges from 0.010 to 0.130 mag yr$^{-1}$, which is reasonably explained\nwith the conventional picture.

In\naddition, regarding the scarcity of spectrum in below 6GHz bands, the proposed\nalgorithm dynamically allocates the resource blocks (RBs) to licensed users in\na way to mostly preserve the continuity of unallocated RBs. This would improve\nthe efficiency of communication among the unlicensed entities by increasing the\nchance of uninterrupted communication and reducing the load of coordination\noverheads. The optimization problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP), observing the entire queue of the demands, where failing to meet QoS\nconstraints penalizes the goal with a multiplicative factor. Furthermore, a\nnotion of continuity for unallocated resources is taken into account as an\nadditive term in the objective function.

Recently, the mining\npools are proved to be vulnerable for several possible attacks, and pool block\nwithholding attack is one of them: one strategic pool manager sends some of her\nminers to other pools and these miners pretend to work on the puzzles but\nactually do nothing. And these miners still get reward since the pool manager\ncan not recognize these malicious miners. In this work, we revisit the\ngame-theoretic model for pool block withholding attacks and propose a revised\napproach to reallocate the reward to the miners. Fortunately, in the new model,\nthe pool managers have strong incentive to not launch such attacks. We show\nthat for any number of mining pools, no-pool-attacks is always a Nash\nequilibrium. Moreover, with only two minority mining pools participating,\nno-pool-attacks is actually the unique Nash equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 14:40:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

In this formulation, space fractional-order operators are used to\ncapture the nonlocal response of the medium by introducing nonlocal kinematic\nrelations. First, we use the geometrically nonlinear fractional-order kinematic\nrelations within an energy-based approach to establish the Lagrange-Dirichlet\nstability criteria for fractional-order nonlocal structures. This energy-based\napproach to nonlocal structural stability is possible due to a\npositive-definite and thermodynamically consistent definition of deformation\nenergy enabled by the fractional-order kinematic formulation. Then, the\nRayleigh-Ritz coefficient for the critical load is derived for linear buckling\nconditions. The fractional-order formulation is finally used to determine\ncritical buckling loads of slender nonlocal beams and plates using a dedicated\nfractional-order finite element solver. Results establish that, in contrast to\nexisting studies, the effect of nonlocal interactions is observed on both the\nmaterial and the geometric stiffness, when using the fractional-order\nkinematics approach. We support these observations quantitatively with the help\nof case studies focusing on the critical buckling response of fractional-order\nnonlocal slender structures, and qualitatively via direct comparison of the\nfractional-order approach with the classical nonlocal approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 18:27:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-27"}
