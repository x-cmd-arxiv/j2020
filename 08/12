The most significant drawback of\nMRI is long acquisition times, prohibiting its use in standard practice for\nsome applications. Compressed sensing (CS) proposes to subsample the k-space\n(the Fourier domain dual to the physical space of spatial coordinates) leading\nto significantly accelerated acquisition. However, the benefit of compressed\nsensing has not been fully exploited; most of the sampling densities obtained\nthrough CS do not produce a trajectory that obeys the stringent constraints of\nthe MRI machine imposed in practice. Inspired by recent success of deep\nlearning based approaches for image reconstruction and ideas from computational\nimaging on learning-based design of imaging systems, we introduce 3D FLAT, a\nnovel protocol for data-driven design of 3D non-Cartesian accelerated\ntrajectories in MRI. Our proposal leverages the entire 3D k-space to\nsimultaneously learn a physically feasible acquisition trajectory with a\nreconstruction method.

We show that the map is\ndetermined by local conditional expectations acting on the operator algebras of\nthe boundary/physical Hilbert space. Several existing results in the literature\nfollow easily from this perspective. The Black Hole area law, and more\ngenerally the Ryu-Takayanagi area operator, arises from a central sum of\nentropies on the relative commutant. These entropies are determined in a state\nindependent way by the conditional expectation. The conditional expectation can\nalso be found via a minimization procedure, similar to the minimization\ninvolved in the RT formula. For a local net of algebras associated to connected\nboundary regions, we show the complementary recovery condition is equivalent to\nthe existence of a standard net of inclusions -- an abstraction of the\nmathematical structure governing QFT superselection sectors given by Longo and\nRehren. For a code consisting of algebras associated to two disjoint regions of\nthe boundary theory we impose an extra condition, dubbed dual-additivity, that\ngives rise to phase transitions between different entanglement wedges.\nDual-additive codes naturally give rise to a new split code subspace, and an\nentropy bound controls which subspace and associated algebra is\nreconstructable.

All major cloud providers offer FaaS products (Amazon Lambda,\nGoogle Cloud Functions, Azure Serverless); there are also popular open-source\nimplementations (Apache OpenWhisk) with commercial offerings (Adobe I/O\nRuntime, IBM Cloud Functions). A new feature of FaaS is function composition: a\nfunction may (sequentially) call another function, which, in turn, may call yet\nanother function - forming a chain of invocations. From the perspective of the\ninfrastructure, a composed FaaS is less opaque than a virtual machine or a\ncontainer. We show that this additional information enables the infrastructure\nto reduce the response latency. In particular, knowing the sequence of future\ninvocations, the infrastructure can schedule these invocations along with\nenvironment preparation. We model resource management in FaaS as a scheduling\nproblem combining (1) sequencing of invocations, (2) deploying execution\nenvironments on machines, and (3) allocating invocations to deployed\nenvironments. For each aspect, we propose heuristics. We explore their\nperformance by simulation on a range of synthetic workloads.

In this paper, we propose an fully-interpretable video\nforensic method that is designed specifically to expose deep-faked videos. To\nenhance generalizability on videos with various content, we model the temporal\nmotion of multiple specific spatial locations in the videos to extract a robust\nand reliable representation, called Co-Motion Pattern. Such kind of conjoint\npattern is mined across local motion features which is independent of the video\ncontents so that the instance-wise variation can also be largely alleviated.\nMore importantly, our proposed co-motion pattern possesses both superior\ninterpretability and sufficient robustness against data compression for\ndeep-faked videos. We conduct extensive experiments to empirically demonstrate\nthe superiority and effectiveness of our approach under both classification and\nanomaly detection evaluation settings against the state-of-the-art deep\nforensic methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 16:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

In addition, the amount of feedback needed grows with the level of\ntask difficulty and the quality of human feedback might decrease over time\nbecause of fatigue. To overcome these limitations and enable learning more\nrobot tasks with higher complexities, there is a need to maximize the quality\nof expensive feedback received and reduce the amount of human cognitive\ninvolvement required.

Emergent DNN hardware accelerators begin to\nsupport mixed precision (1-8 bits) to further improve the computation\nefficiency, which raises a great challenge to find the optimal bitwidth for\neach layer: it requires domain experts to explore the vast design space trading\noff among accuracy, latency, energy, and model size, which is both\ntime-consuming and sub-optimal. Conventional quantization algorithm ignores the\ndifferent hardware architectures and quantizes all the layers in a uniform way.\nIn this paper, we introduce the Hardware-Aware Automated Quantization (HAQ)\nframework which leverages the reinforcement learning to automatically determine\nthe quantization policy, and we take the hardware accelerator's feedback in the\ndesign loop. Rather than relying on proxy signals such as FLOPs and model size,\nwe employ a hardware simulator to generate direct feedback signals (latency and\nenergy) to the RL agent. Compared with conventional methods, our framework is\nfully automated and can specialize the quantization policy for different neural\nnetwork architectures and hardware architectures. Our framework effectively\nreduced the latency by 1.4-1.95x and the energy consumption by 1.9x with\nnegligible loss of accuracy compared with the fixed bitwidth (8 bits)\nquantization. Our framework reveals that the optimal policies on different\nhardware architectures (i.e., edge and cloud architectures) under different\nresource constraints (i.e., latency, energy, and model size) are drastically\ndifferent.

This sensitivity enhancement is fundamentally rooted in\nthe formation of Schr\\\"odinger cat states, or macroscopic superposition states\nat the quantum critical points. The cat states, however, are fragile to\ndecoherence caused by local noises on individual particles or coupling to local\nenvironments, since the local decoherence of any particle would cause the\ncollapse of the whole cat state. Therefore, it is unclear whether the\nsub-Heisenberg scaling of quantum critical metrology is robust against the\nlocal decoherence. Here we study the effects of local decoherence on the\nquantum critical metrology, using a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising\nmodel as a representative example. Based on a previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n94, 047201 (2005)] on the critical behaviors of the noisy Ising model, which\nshows that the universality class of the quantum criticality is modified by the\ndecoherence, we find that the standard quantum limit is recovered by the\nsingle-particle decoherence, which is equivalent to local quantum measurement\nconducted by the environment and destroys the many-body entanglement in the\nground state at the quantum critical point. Following the renormalization group\nanalysis [Phys. Rev. B 69, 054426 (2004)], we argue that the noise effects on\nquantum critical metrology should be universal.

This behavioral equality is then generalized\nto semantic equality of the original program elements. It uses the likelihood\nbetween model elements as a distance metric. Then, it employs the likelihood\nratio significance test to decide whether this distance is significant, given a\npre-specified and controllable false-positive rate. The output of SCD-PSM are\npairs of program elements (i.e., methods), their distance, and a decision on\nwhether they are clones or not.

We call a sum rule dispersive if it has\ndouble zeros at all double-twist operators above a fixed twist gap. Dispersive\nsum rules have their conceptual origin in Lorentzian kinematics and absorptive\nphysics (the notion of double discontinuity). They have been discussed using\nthree seemingly different methods: analytic functionals dual to double-twist\noperators, dispersion relations in position space, and dispersion relations in\nMellin space. We show that these three approaches can be mapped into one\nanother and lead to completely equivalent sum rules.

Unlike the usual OPE sum, the Polyakov-Regge expansion\nutilizes the data of two separate channels, while having (term by term) good\nRegge behavior in the third channel.

The models differ in\nterms of their orbital energy, orientation of the orbital spin vector, and\nmorphology of the satellite galaxy (discy/spheroidal). We demonstrate that the\ncentral stellar bar, initially present in the host galaxy, undergoes a\ntransient bar amplification phase after each pericentre passage of the\nsatellite; in concordance with past studies of bar excitation due to tidal\nencounter. However, once the merger happens, the central stellar bar weakens\nsubstantially in the post-merger remnants. The accumulation of satellite's\nstars in the central region of merger remnant plays a key role in the bar\nweakening process; causing a net increase in the central mass concentration as\nwell as in the specific angular momentum content. We find that the efficiency\nof mass accumulation from the satellite in the central parts of merger remnants\ndepends on the orbital parameters as well as on the satellite's morphology.\nConsequently, different minor merger models display different degrees of bar\nweakening event. This demonstrates that minor merger of galaxies is a plausible\navenue for bar weakening in disc galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 18:12:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 10:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

The probabilities p(s) of the\noccurrence of an event when the system is in different states s of S define a\nfunction from S to [0,1] called a numerical event or, more accurately, an\nS-probability. Sets of S-probabilities ordered by the partial order of\nfunctions give rise to so called algebras of S-probabilities, in particular to\nthe ones that are lattice-ordered. Among these there are the sigma-algebras\nknown from probability theory and the Hilbert-space logics which are important\nin quantum-mechanics. Any algebra of S-probabilities can serve as a\nquantum-logic, and it is of special interest when this logic turns out to be a\nBoolean algebra because then the observed physical system will be classical.\nBoolean algebras are in one-to-one correspondence to Boolean rings, and the\nquestion arises to find an analogue correspondence for lattice-ordered algebras\nof S-probabilities generalizing the correspondence between Boolean algebras and\nBoolean rings. We answer this question by defining ring-like structures of\nevents (RLSEs). First, the structure of RLSEs is revealed and Boolean rings\namong RLSEs are characterized. Then we establish how RLSEs correspond to\nlattice-ordered algebras of numerical events. Further, functions for\nassociating lattice-ordered algebras of S-probabilities to RLSEs are studied.\nIt is shown that there are only two ways to assign lattice-ordered algebras of\nS-probabilities to RLSEs if one restricts the corresponding mappings to term\nfunctions over the underlying orthomodular lattice. These term functions are\nthe very functions by which also Boolean algebras can be assigned to Boolean\nrings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 18:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

For small but finite values of the Capillary number, the\ndroplet speed behaves monotonically as a function of the applied temperature\ngradient for a fixed ratio of the Capillary and Weissenberg numbers. We\ndemonstrate that this behaviour is related to the polymeric stresses deforming\nthe droplet in the direction of its migration, while the associated changes in\nits speed are Newtonian in nature, being related to a change in the droplet's\nhydrodynamic resistance and its internal temperature distribution. When\ncompared to the results of numerical simulations, our theory exhibits a good\npredictive power for sufficiently small values of the Capillary and Weissenberg\nnumbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 19:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

Recent works assume that images descriptors\ncan be disentangled into a domain-invariant content representation and a\ndomain-specific style representation. Thus, translation models seek to preserve\nthe content of source images while changing the style to a target visual\ndomain. However, synthesizing new images is extremely challenging especially in\nmulti-domain translations, as the network has to compose content and style to\ngenerate reliable and diverse images in multiple domains. In this paper we\npropose the use of an image retrieval system to assist the image-to-image\ntranslation task. First, we train an image-to-image translation model to map\nimages to multiple domains. Then, we train an image retrieval model using real\nand generated images to find images similar to a query one in content but in a\ndifferent domain. Finally, we exploit the image retrieval system to fine-tune\nthe image-to-image translation model and generate higher quality images. Our\nexperiments show the effectiveness of the proposed solution and highlight the\ncontribution of the retrieval network, which can benefit from additional\nunlabeled data and help image-to-image translation models in the presence of\nscarce data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 20:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

Change is\ninherent in the nature of things and has increasingly become a focus of much\ninterest and investigation. Change can be modeled as a transition between two\nstates of a finite state machine (FSM). This change represents an exploratory\nstarting point in this paper. Accordingly, a sample FSM that models a car s\ntransmission system is re-expressed in terms of a new modeling methodology\ncalled thinging machine (TM) modeling. Recasting the car-transmission model\ninvolves developing (1) an S model that captures the static aspects, (2) a D\nmodel that identifies states, and (3) a B model that specifies the behavior.\nThe analysis progresses as follows. - S represents an atemporal diagrammatic\ndescription that embeds underlying compositions (static changes) from which the\nroots of system behavior can be traced. - S is broken down into multiple\nsubsystems that correspond to static states (ordered constitutive components).\n- Introducing time into static states converts these states into events, and\nthe behavior (B) model is constructed based on the chronology of these events.\nThe analysis shows that FSM states are static (atemporal) changes that\nintroduce temporal events as carriers of behavior. This result enhances the\nsemantics of the concepts of change, states, and events in modeling and shows\nhow to specify a system s behavior through its static description.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 22:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

While the BAO has\nprimarily been used as a standard ruler, it also encodes recombination era\nphysics, as demonstrated by a recent measurement of the neutrino-induced phase\nshift in the BAO feature. In principle, these measurements offer a novel window\ninto physics at the time of baryon decoupling. However, our analytic\nunderstanding of the BAO feature is limited, particularly for the range of\nFourier modes measured in surveys. As a result, it is unclear what the BAO\nphase teaches us about the early universe beyond what is already known from the\ncosmic microwave background (CMB).

The total phase shift we find is\ncomparable to a few percent shift in the BAO scale (frequency) and thus\nrelevant in current data. Our results include an improved analytic calculation\nof the neutrino induced phase shift template that is in close agreement with\nthe numerically determined template used in measurements of the CMB and BAO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 22:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

Previous studies focus on distant supervision under the assumption of\ncentralized training, which requires collecting texts from different platforms\nand storing them on one machine.

Overcoming label noise of distant supervision, however,\nbecomes more difficult in federated settings, since the sentences containing\nthe same entity pair may scatter around different platforms. In this paper, we\npropose a federated denoising framework to suppress label noise in federated\nsettings.

Previously, only a\nbound of $\\approx \\frac{1}{\\alpha(t)}$, where $\\alpha$ is the inverse Ackermann\nfunction, was known.\n  The GHZ game was recently identified by Dinur, Harsha, Venkat and Yuen as a\nmulti-player game where all existing techniques for proving strong bounds on\nthe value of the parallel repetition of the game fail. Indeed, to prove our\nresult we use a completely new proof technique.

The orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm\nis widely used for reconstructing $x$. A fundamental question in the\nperformance analysis of OMP is the characterizations of the probability of\nexact recovery of $x$ for random matrix $A$ and the minimal $m$ to guarantee a\ntarget recovery performance. In many practical applications, in addition to\nsparsity, $x$ also has some additional properties. This paper shows that these\nproperties can be used to refine the answer to the above question. In this\npaper, we first show that the prior information of the nonzero entries of $x$\ncan be used to provide an upper bound on $\\|x\\|_1^2/\\|x\\|_2^2$. Then, we use\nthis upper bound to develop a lower bound on the probability of exact recovery\nof $x$ using OMP in $K$ iterations.

Applying the same correction to the optically corrected bivariate\nluminosity function from our previous paper produces a larger density increase\nof about 0.5 to 1 dex in the lowest HI mass-to-light ratio bins for a given\nluminosity while having a minimal effect on the resulting HIMF low mass slope,\nwhich still agrees with blind survey HIMFs.

However, localization maps extracted from\nclassification networks are often not accurate due to the lack of fine\npixel-level supervision. In this paper, we propose to leverage pixel-level\nsimilarities across different objects for learning more accurate object\nlocations in a complementary way. Particularly, two kinds of constraints are\nproposed to prompt the consistency of object features within the same\ncategories. The first constraint is to learn the stochastic feature consistency\namong discriminative pixels that are randomly sampled from different images\nwithin a batch. The discriminative information embedded in one image can be\nleveraged to benefit its counterpart with inter-image communication. The second\nconstraint is to learn the global consistency of object features throughout the\nentire dataset. We learn a feature center for each category and realize the\nglobal feature consistency by forcing the object features to approach\nclass-specific centers. The global centers are actively updated with the\ntraining process. The two constraints can benefit each other to learn\nconsistent pixel-level features within the same categories, and finally improve\nthe quality of localization maps.

If the magnetar\ngiant flares occur in nearby galaxies, they would appear as cosmic short-hard\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs) without detecting the weak oscillatory phase. Recently,\na short-hard GRB named GRB 200415A was detected, with a position coincident\nwith the Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253), rasing the question whether it is a classic\nshort GRB or a magentar giant flare.

A typical challenge that hinders their real-world\napplications is that unknown samples may be fed into the system during the\ntesting phase, but traditional deep neural networks will wrongly recognize\nthese unknown samples as one of the known classes. Open set recognition (OSR)\nis a potential solution to overcome this problem, where the open set classifier\nshould have the flexibility to reject unknown samples and meanwhile maintain\nhigh classification accuracy in known classes. Probabilistic generative models,\nsuch as Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Adversarial Autoencoders (AAE), are\npopular methods to detect unknowns, but they cannot provide discriminative\nrepresentations for known classification. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework, called Conditional Probabilistic Generative Models (CPGM), for open\nset recognition. The core insight of our work is to add discriminative\ninformation into the probabilistic generative models, such that the proposed\nmodels can not only detect unknown samples but also classify known classes by\nforcing different latent features to approximate conditional Gaussian\ndistributions. We discuss many model variants and provide comprehensive\nexperiments to study their characteristics.

According to the characteristic\nstains and the derived maximum detectable distances, four sources among eight\nUCXBs with the observed distances are expected to be detected by the LISA.\nBased on the parameter space given by the detailed binary evolution models and\nthe rapid binary star evolution code, the birthrate of UCXBs appearing as LISA\nsources in the Galaxy is estimated to be $(2-2.6)\\times10^{\\rm -6}~\\rm\nyr^{-1}$. Considering the contribution of UCXBs in the globular clusters, the\nnumber of UCXB-LISA sources can reach $240 - 320$. Although the formation\ncondition is severe, the detectability of UCXBs by the LISA is still optimistic\nand significant because they provide an opportunity to pursue full\nmulti-messenger investigations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 07:27:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

Due to the\ncontinuous nature of deep neural networks, the prediction of scene graphs is\ndivided into object detection and relation classification. However, the\nindependent relation classes cannot separate the visual features well. Although\nsome methods organize the visual features into graph structures and use message\npassing to learn contextual information, they still suffer from drastic\nintra-class variations and unbalanced data distributions. One important factor\nis that they learn an unstructured output space that ignores the inherent\nstructures of scene graphs.

These costs of individual features may be financial costs,\nbut can also refer to other aspects, like for example evaluation time. Feature\nselection addresses both objectives, as it reduces the number of features and\ncan improve the generalization ability of the model. If costs differ between\nfeatures, the feature selection needs to trade-off the individual benefit and\ncost of each feature. A popular trade-off choice is the ratio of both, the BCR\n(benefit-cost ratio). In this paper we analyze implications of using this\nmeasure with special focus to the ability to distinguish relevant features from\nnoise.

This drastically facilitates modeling\nfrom first principles of the physics and the reuse of models. In this paper we\ndevelop the mathematical theory needed to establish the development of\ncompilers and tools for DAE based physical modeling languages on solid\nmathematical bases. Unlike Ordinary Differential Equations, DAE exhibit subtle\nissues because of the notion of differentiation index and related latent\nequations -- ODE are DAE of index zero for which no latent equation needs to be\nconsidered. Prior to generating execution code and calling solvers, the\ncompilation of such languages requires a nontrivial \\emph{structural analysis}\nstep that reduces the differentiation index to a level acceptable by DAE\nsolvers. The models supported by tools of the Modelica class involve multiple\nmodes with mode-dependent DAE based dynamics and state-dependent mode\nswitching. Multimode DAE are much more difficult than DAE. The main difficulty\nis the handling of the events of mode change. Unfortunately, the large\nliterature devoted to the mathematical analysis of DAEs does not cover the\nmultimode case, typically saying nothing about mode changes. This lack of\nfoundations causes numerous difficulties to the existing modeling tools. Some\nmodels are well handled, others are not, with no clear boundary between the two\nclasses. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive mathematical approach\nsupporting compilation and code generation for this class of languages. Its\ncore is the structural analysis of multimode DAE systems. As a byproduct of\nthis structural analysis, we propose well sound criteria for accepting or\nrejecting models. For our mathematical development, we rely on nonstandard\nanalysis, which allows us to cast hybrid systems dynamics to discrete time\ndynamics with infinitesimal step size, thus providing a uniform framework for\nhandling both continuous dynamics and mode change events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 08:30:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 10:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

In\ncache-enabling UAV NOMA networks, the caching placement of content caching\nphase and radio resource allocation of content delivery phase are crucial for\nnetwork performance. To cope with the dynamic UAV locations and content\nrequests in practical scenarios, we formulate the long-term caching placement\nand resource allocation optimization problem for content delivery delay\nminimization as a Markov decision process (MDP). The UAV acts as an agent to\ntake actions for caching placement and resource allocation, which includes the\nuser scheduling of content requests and the power allocation of NOMA users.

In Euclidean geometry the mean-as used in k-means-is a good\nestimator for the cluster center, but this does not exist for arbitrary\ndissimilarities. PAM uses the medoid instead, the object with the smallest\ndissimilarity to all others in the cluster. This notion of centrality can be\nused with any (dis-)similarity, and thus is of high relevance to many domains\nand applications. A key issue with PAM is its high run time cost. We propose\nmodifications to the PAM algorithm that achieve an O(k)-fold speedup in the\nsecond (\"SWAP\") phase of the algorithm, but will still find the same results as\nthe original PAM algorithm.

To overcome the privacy and overhead challenges of centralized machine\nlearning, there has been a significant recent interest in the concept of\nfederated learning. Federated learning offers on-device, privacy-preserving\nmachine learning without the need to transfer end-devices data to a third party\nlocation. However, federated learning still has privacy concerns due to\nsensitive information inferring capability of the aggregation server using\nend-devices local learning models.

In emerging markets, in particular, firms constantly\nadjust pricing strategies to collect adequate demand information, which is a\nprocess known as price experimentation. To date, few papers have investigated\nthe pricing decision process in a competitive environment with unknown demand\ncurves, conditions that make analysis more complex. Asynchronous price updating\ncan render the demand information gathered by price experimentation less\ninformative or inaccurate, as it is nearly impossible for firms to remain\ninformed about the latest prices set by competitors. Hence, firms may set\nprices using available, yet out-of-date, price information of competitors.\n  In this paper, we design an algorithm to facilitate synchronized dynamic\npricing, in which competitive firms estimate their demand functions based on\nobservations and adjust their pricing strategies in a prescribed manner.

However, recent studies have revealed that facial\nexpressions in our human life can be blended with multiple basic emotions. And\nthe emotion labels for these in-the-wild facial expressions cannot easily be\nannotated solely on pre-defined AU patterns. How to analyze the action units\nfor such complex expressions is still an open question. To address this issue,\nwe develop a RAF-AU database that employs a sign-based (i.e., AUs) and\njudgement-based (i.e., perceived emotion) approach to annotating blended facial\nexpressions in the wild. We first reviewed the annotation methods in existing\ndatabases and identified crowdsourcing as a promising strategy for labeling\nin-the-wild facial expressions. Then, RAF-AU was finely annotated by\nexperienced coders, on which we also conducted a preliminary investigation of\nwhich key AUs contribute most to a perceived emotion, and the relationship\nbetween AUs and facial expressions. Finally, we provided a baseline for AU\nrecognition in RAF-AU using popular features and multi-label learning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 09:29:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 03:29:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 07:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

Such SSC\ncould become a resource to demonstrate quantum advantage in the applications.\nWe predict the generation of SSC if the target system repeatedly interacts with\nindependent and non-correlated bath elements. To describe their behavior, we\nuse the collision model approach of system-bath interaction, where the system\ninteracts with one bath element (initially in an incoherent state) at a time,\nasymptotically (in the fast-collision regime) mimicking a macroscopic Markovian\nbath coupled to the target system. Therefore, the SSC qualitatively appears to\nbe the same as if the continuous Markovian bath would be used. We confirm that\nthe presence of composite system-bath interactions under the rotating-wave\napproximation (RWA) is the necessary condition for the generation of SSC using\nthermal resources in collision models. Remarkably, we show that SSC\nsubstantially increases if the target system interacts collectively with more\nthan one bath element at a time. Already few bath elements collectively\ninteracting with the target system are sufficient to increase SSC at non-zero\ntemperatures at the cost of tolerable lowering the final state purity. From the\nthermodynamic perspective, the SSC generation in our collision models is\ninevitably linked to a non zero power input (and thus heat dissipated to the\nbath) necessary to reach the steady-state, although such energetic cost can be\nlower compared to cases relying on SSC non generating interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 09:40:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 01:50:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 23:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

It is becoming increasingly\nchallenging to determine whether given accounts on different SMNs belong to the\nsame user; this can be expressed as an interlayer link prediction problem in a\nmultiplex network. To address the challenge of predicting interlayer links ,\nfeature or structure information is leveraged. Existing methods that use\nnetwork embedding techniques to address this problem focus on learning a\nmapping function to unify all nodes into a common latent representation space\nfor prediction; positional relationships between unmatched nodes and their\ncommon matched neighbors (CMNs) are not utilized. Furthermore, the layers are\noften modeled as unweighted graphs, ignoring the strengths of the relationships\nbetween nodes. To address these limitations, we propose a framework based on\nmultiple types of consistency between embedding vectors (MulCEV). In MulCEV,\nthe traditional embedding-based method is applied to obtain the degree of\nconsistency between the vectors representing the unmatched nodes, and a\nproposed distance consistency index based on the positions of nodes in each\nlatent space provides additional clues for prediction. By associating these two\ntypes of consistency, the effective information in the latent spaces is fully\nutilized. Additionally, MulCEV models the layers as weighted graphs to obtain\nrepresentation. In this way, the higher the strength of the relationship\nbetween nodes, the more similar their embedding vectors in the latent\nrepresentation space will be. The results of our experiments on several\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed MulCEV framework markedly\noutperforms current embedding-based methods, especially when the number of\ntraining iterations is small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 10:04:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 01:56:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 12:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

Earlier\nstudies have tried to resolve this issue by employing an intrinsic reward to\ninduce interactions that are helpful for learning an effective policy. However,\nthis approach requires extensive prior knowledge for designing an intrinsic\nreward. To train the MARL model effectively without designing the intrinsic\nreward, we propose a learning-based exploration strategy to generate the\ninitial states of a game. The proposed method adopts a variational graph\nautoencoder to represent a game state such that (1) the state can be compactly\nencoded to a latent representation by considering relationships among agents,\nand (2) the latent representation can be used as an effective input for a\ncoupled surrogate model to predict an exploration score.

By reinforcing the former while maintaining the latter, any\nredundant information, be it adversarial or not, should be removed from the\nlatent representation.

In this work,\nwe tackle the task of cross-modal retrieval through image-sentence matching\nbased on word-region alignments, using supervision only at the global\nimage-sentence level. Specifically, we present a novel approach called\nTransformer Encoder Reasoning and Alignment Network (TERAN). TERAN enforces a\nfine-grained match between the underlying components of images and sentences,\ni.e., image regions and words, respectively, in order to preserve the\ninformative richness of both modalities. TERAN obtains state-of-the-art results\non the image retrieval task on both MS-COCO and Flickr30k datasets. Moreover,\non MS-COCO, it also outperforms current approaches on the sentence retrieval\ntask.\n  Focusing on scalable cross-modal information retrieval, TERAN is designed to\nkeep the visual and textual data pipelines well separated. Cross-attention\nlinks invalidate any chance to separately extract visual and textual features\nneeded for the online search and the offline indexing steps in large-scale\nretrieval systems. In this respect, TERAN merges the information from the two\ndomains only during the final alignment phase, immediately before the loss\ncomputation. We argue that the fine-grained alignments produced by TERAN pave\nthe way towards the research for effective and efficient methods for\nlarge-scale cross-modal information retrieval. We compare the effectiveness of\nour approach against relevant state-of-the-art methods. On the MS-COCO 1K test\nset, we obtain an improvement of 5.7% and 3.5% respectively on the image and\nthe sentence retrieval tasks on the Recall@1 metric.

We train a meta-optimizer which learns to robustly optimize a\nmodel using adversarial examples and is able to transfer the knowledge learned\nto new models, without the need to generate new adversarial examples.\nExperimental results show the meta-optimizer is consistent across different\narchitectures and data sets, suggesting it is possible to automatically patch\nadversarial vulnerabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 11:44:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

The exact relation between the reference and\nequidistant strains is employed and the complete analytic elastic constitutive\nrelation between energetically conjugated forces and strains is derived via the\nreciprocal shift tensor. Utilizing these strict relations, the geometric\nstiffness matrix is derived explicitly by the variation of the unknown metric.\nMoreover, a compact form of this matrix is presented. Despite the linear\ndisplacement distribution due to the Kirchhoff-Love hypothesis, a nonlinear\nstrain distribution arises along the shell thickness. This fact is sometimes\ndisregarded for the nonlinear analysis of thin shells based on the initial\ngeometry, thereby ignoring the strong curviness of a shell at some subsequent\nconfiguration.

Conventionally, there are two mainstream\nneural architectures for NLP tasks: the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the\nconvolution neural network (ConvNet). RNNs are good at modeling long-term\ndependencies over input texts, but preclude parallel computation. ConvNets do\nnot have memory capability and it has to model sequential data as un-ordered\nfeatures. Therefore, ConvNets fail to learn sequential dependencies over the\ninput texts, but it is able to carry out high-efficient parallel computation.\nAs each neural architecture, such as RNN and ConvNets, has its own pro and con,\nintegration of different architectures is assumed to be able to enrich the\nsemantic representation of texts, thus enhance the performance of NLP tasks.\nHowever, few investigation explores the reconciliation of these seemingly\nincompatible architectures. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid\narchitecture based on a novel hierarchical multi-granularity attention\nmechanism, named Multi-granularity Attention-based Hybrid Neural Network\n(MahNN). The attention mechanism is to assign different weights to different\nparts of the input sequence to increase the computation efficiency and\nperformance of neural models. In MahNN, two types of attentions are introduced:\nthe syntactical attention and the semantical attention. The syntactical\nattention computes the importance of the syntactic elements (such as words or\nsentence) at the lower symbolic level and the semantical attention is used to\ncompute the importance of the embedded space dimension corresponding to the\nupper latent semantics. We adopt the text classification as an exemplifying way\nto illustrate the ability of MahNN to understand texts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 13:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

An upper\nbound can be placed on the induced dissipation via energy and entropy flux\nthroughout the interior. The induced Ohmic dissipation is directly linked to\nthe electrical conductivity profile of the materials involved in the flow. We\npresent a method for calculating electrical conductivity profiles of ionically\nconducting hydrogen-helium-water mixtures under planetary conditions, using\nresults from ab initio simulations. We apply this prescription on several ice\ngiant interior structure models available in the literature, where all the\nheavy elements are represented by water.

On the other hand, this approach\nrequires computationally expensive matrix inversions since the fluxes are only\nimplicitly given. We propose and discuss a novel and more direct closure which\navoids the inversion of the Maxwell-Stefan equations.

Drug\nrepurposing, which is the process of reusing already-approved drugs for new\nmedical conditions, can be a good way to solve this problem quickly and\nbroadly. Many clinical trials for COVID-19 patients using treatments for other\ndiseases have already been in place or will be performed at clinical sites in\nthe near future. Additionally, patients with comorbidities such as diabetes\nmellitus, obesity, liver cirrhosis, kidney diseases, hypertension, and asthma\nare at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Thus, the relationship of\ncomorbidity disease with COVID-19 may help to find repurposable drugs. To\nreduce trial and error in finding treatments for COVID-19, we propose building\na network-based drug repurposing framework to prioritize repurposable drugs.\nFirst, we utilized knowledge of COVID-19 to construct a disease-gene-drug\nnetwork (DGDr-Net) representing a COVID-19-centric interactome with components\nfor diseases, genes, and drugs. DGDr-Net consisted of 592 diseases, 26,681\nhuman genes and 2,173 drugs, and medical information for 18 common\ncomorbidities. The DGDr-Net recommended candidate repurposable drugs for\nCOVID-19 through network reinforcement driven scoring algorithms.

In CNTFs this process is dominated by surface processes,\ninsertion in the bundles interstices, electrochemical doping and\noften-overlooked partial degradation of the sp2 lattice upon cycling. Through\nextensive electrochemical analysis, together with in situ Raman spectroscopy\nmeasurements, we analyzed the complex lithiation behavior of highly crystalline\nfibers of CNTs. CNTF can store lithium reversibly with high specific capacity\nand rate capability, thanks to a large capacitive contribution. Upon\nlithiation, they undergo electrochemical doping, with longitudinal conductivity\nincreasing by as much as 100 %, concomitant with large downshifts in Raman\nspectra. However, CNTF are also affected by high first-cycle irreversible\ncapacity, voltage hysteresis and amorphization upon cycling. Electrochemical\nanalysis confirms that SEI formation is responsible for the first-cycle\nirreversible capacity. Voltage hysteresis is attributed primarily to the\ntrapping of lithium ions in the interstices between stacked nanotubes. Another\ndominant feature is pre-existing defects, which promote capacitive storage but\nlead to progressive amorphization of the CNTFs. Indeed, it is evidenced that\nundesired amorphization is hindered in ultra-pure CNTF without pre-existing\ndefects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 15:32:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 13:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-21"}

We decomposed the velocity in the\nsimulations into Alfv\\'en, slow and fast-modes and studied how each of them\ncontribute to the observed anisotropy. We found that when the angle between the\nline of sight and the mean magnetic field is large the Alfv\\'en-mode dominates\nthe observed anisotropy, while for smaller angles the anisotropy is not large\nenough to be used to probe the magnetization of the media, and it is dominated\nby the slow-mode. Our results are in fair agreement with the theoretical\npredictions in Kandel et al.(2016,2017).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 15:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

Luce addresses two critical issues of property valuation: the lack\nof recent sold prices and the sparsity of house data. It is designed to operate\non a limited volume of recent house transaction data. As a departure from prior\nwork, Luce organizes the house data in a heterogeneous information network\n(HIN) where graph nodes are house entities and attributes that are important\nfor house price valuation. We employ a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to\nextract the spatial information from the HIN for house-related data like\ngeographical locations, and then use a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to\nmodel the temporal dependencies for house transaction data over time. Unlike\nprior work, Luce can make effective use of the limited house transactions data\nin the past few months to update valuation information for all house entities\nwithin the HIN. By providing a complete and up-to-date house valuation dataset,\nLuce thus massively simplifies the downstream valuation task for the targeting\nproperties. We demonstrate the benefit of Luce by applying it to large,\nreal-life datasets obtained from the Toronto real estate market. Extensive\nexperimental results show that Luce not only significantly outperforms prior\nproperty valuation methods but also often reaches and sometimes exceeds the\nvaluation accuracy given by independent experts when using the actual\nrealization price as the ground truth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 07:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-14"}

Furthermore, once protein synthesis\nwas fully established and apparently superseding the RNA world, and at a very\nearly stage of life beginnings, we already see what has been a recurrent theme\nin the likely interpretation of modern comparative molecular studies on\nspecies: the full ability of this nascent life entity to develop itself by\ntinkering, using all kinds of available pieces to improve itself.

Because of their complexity and\ntheir ability to innovate with respect to their environment, living systems are\nconsidered to be open-ended. Historically, it has been difficult to model\nopen-ended evolution and innovation. As a result, our understanding of the\nexact mechanisms that distinguish open-ended living systems from non-living\nones is limited. One of the biggest barriers is understanding how multiple,\ncomplex parts within a single system interact and contribute to the complex,\nemergent behavior of the system as a whole. How do interactions between parts\nof a system lead to more complex behavior of the system as a whole? This paper\npresents two interacting cellular automata (CA) as an abstract model to address\nthe effects of complex interactions between two individual entities embedded\nwithin a larger system. Unlike elementary CA, each CA changes its update rules\nas a function of the system's state as a whole. The resulting behavior of the\ntwo-CA system suggests that complex interaction functions between the two CA\nhave little to no effect on the complexity of each individual CA behavior and\nstructure.

The\nbroad adoption of radar sensors increases the chance of interference among\nsensors from different vehicles, generating corrupted range profiles and\nrange-Doppler maps. In order to extract distance and velocity of multiple\ntargets from range-Doppler maps, the interference affecting each range profile\nneeds to be mitigated. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional neural\nnetwork for automotive radar interference mitigation. In order to train our\nnetwork in a real-world scenario, we introduce a new data set of realistic\nautomotive radar signals with multiple targets and multiple interferers. To our\nknowledge, we are the first to apply weight pruning in the automotive radar\ndomain, obtaining superior results compared to the widely-used dropout.

For instance, our novel approach reduces the phase estimation error with\nrespect to the commonly-adopted zeroing technique by half, from 12.55 degrees\nto 6.58 degrees. Considering the lack of databases for automotive radar\ninterference mitigation, we release as open source our large-scale data set\nthat closely replicates the real-world automotive scenario for multiple\ninterference cases, allowing others to objectively compare their future work in\nthis domain.

Our aim for this paper\nis threefold: (i) Give a brief introduction to deep learning architectures for\nfew-shot learning with pointers to core references. (ii) Indicate how deep\nlearning has been applied to the low-data regime, from data preparation to\nmodel training. and, (iii) Provide a starting point for people interested in\nexperimenting and perhaps contributing to the field of few-shot learning by\npointing out some useful resources and open-source code. Our code is available\nat Github: https://github.com/shruti-jadon/Hands-on-One-Shot-Learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 06:58:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 03:06:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 18:23:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2023 05:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

On the other hand, digital contact tracing is a bottom-up solution that\nstarts with citizens who on obtaining a notification about possible exposure to\nan infected individual may choose to ignore the notification, get tested to\ndetermine if they were actually exposed or self-isolate and monitor their\nsymptoms over the next two weeks. Most experts recommend a combination of\nmanual contact tracing and digital contact advice but they are not based on a\nscientific basis. For example, a possible hybrid solution could involve a\nsmartphone based alert that requests the possible contact of an infected\nindividual to call the Public Health (PH) number for next steps, or in some\ncases, suggest ways to self-assess in order to reduce the burden on PH so only\nmost critical cases require a phone conversation.

While the state-of-the-art in hydraulic\nphase field fracture considers Darcian fracture flow with enhanced permeability\nalong the crack, in this study, the phase field not only acts as a damage\nvariable that provides diffuse representation of cracks or cavities, but also\nacts as an indicator function that separates the domain into two regions where\nfluid flows are governed by Stokes and Darcy equations, respectively. Since the\nphase field and its gradient can be respectively regarded as smooth\napproximations of the Heaviside function and Dirac delta function, our new\napproach is capable of imposing interfacial transmissibility conditions without\nexplicit interface parametrizations. In addition, the interaction between solid\nand fluid constituents is modeled by adopting the concept of mixture theory,\nwhere the fluid velocities in Stokes and Darcy regions are considered as\nrelative measures compared to the solid motion. This model is particularly\nattractive for coupled flow analysis in geological materials with complex\nmicrostructures undergoing brittle fracture often encountered in energy\ngeotechnics problems, since it completely eliminates the needs to generate\nspecific enrichment function, integration scheme, or meshing algorithm tailored\nfor complex geological features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 22:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

Moreover,\nthey often degrade their performance severely on short documents. The\nrequirement of reparameterisation could also comprise their training quality\nand model flexibility. To address these shortcomings, we present a new neural\ntopic model via the theory of optimal transport (OT). Specifically, we propose\nto learn the topic distribution of a document by directly minimising its OT\ndistance to the document's word distributions. Importantly, the cost matrix of\nthe OT distance models the weights between topics and words, which is\nconstructed by the distances between topics and words in an embedding space.\nOur proposed model can be trained efficiently with a differentiable loss.\nExtensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art NTMs on discovering more coherent and diverse topics and\nderiving better document representations for both regular and short texts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 06:37:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 01:49:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 05:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}
