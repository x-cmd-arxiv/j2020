One of the major\nchallenges in this endeavour involves constructing realistic models of stellar\nspectra with which to reliably determine stellar abundances. At present, large\nstellar surveys commonly use simplified models that assume that the stellar\natmospheres are approximately in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). To test\nand ultimately relax this assumption, we have performed non-LTE calculations\nfor $13$ different elements (H, Li, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Mn, and\nBa), using recent model atoms that have physically-motivated descriptions for\nthe inelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen, across a grid of $3756$ 1D\nMARCS model atmospheres that spans $3000\\leq\nT_{\\mathrm{eff}}/\\mathrm{K}\\leq8000$,\n$-0.5\\leq\\log{g/\\mathrm{cm\\,s^{-2}}}\\leq5.5$, and $-5\\leq\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\\leq1$.\nWe present the grids of departure coefficients that have been implemented into\nthe GALAH DR3 analysis pipeline in order to complement the extant non-LTE grid\nfor iron.

Chernoff bound [Che52] implies\nthat a random bi-coloring of any set system with $n$ sets and $n$ elements will\nhave discrepancy $O(\\sqrt{n \\log n})$ with high probability, while the famous\nresult by Spencer [Spe85] shows that there exists an $O(\\sqrt{n})$ discrepancy\nsolution.\n  The study of hyperbolic polynomials dates back to the early 20th century when\nused to solve PDEs by G{\\aa}rding [G{\\aa}r59]. In recent years, more\napplications are found in control theory, optimization, real algebraic\ngeometry, and so on. In particular, the breakthrough result by Marcus,\nSpielman, and Srivastava [MSS15] uses the theory of hyperbolic polynomials to\nprove the Kadison-Singer conjecture [KS59], which is closely related to\ndiscrepancy theory.\n  In this paper, we present a list of new results for hyperbolic polynomials:\n  * We show two nearly optimal hyperbolic Chernoff bounds: one for Rademacher\nsum of arbitrary vectors and another for random vectors in the hyperbolic cone.\n  * We show a hyperbolic anti-concentration bound.\n  * We generalize the hyperbolic Kadison-Singer theorem [Br\\\"a18] for vectors\nin sub-isotropic position, and prove a hyperbolic Spencer theorem for any\nconstant hyperbolic rank vectors.\n  The classical matrix Chernoff and discrepancy results are based on\ndeterminant polynomial. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first\nwork that shows either concentration or anti-concentration results for\nhyperbolic polynomials. We hope our findings provide more insights into\nhyperbolic and discrepancy theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 17:39:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 19:27:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 18:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

As a\nresult, some studies suggest that mobile traffic may increase more than 1000\ntimes compared to the amount of traffic that is generated nowadays. This means\nthat network resources for mobile services must be managed and controlled in a\nsmart way, because resources are always limited, but the demand for services\nand the need for keeping user equipment always connected to mobile networks can\nbe considered unlimited, leaving gap between huge service demands and available\nresources.

The extensive photometric coverage at late phases shows that the\nradioactive tail has two slopes, one steeper than that expected from the decay\nof $^{56}$Co (between 100 and 350 days), and another slower (after 450 days),\nprobably produced by an additional energy source. From the bolometric light\ncurve, we estimated that the amount of ejected $^{56}$Ni is $\\sim0.059\\pm0.003$\nM$\\odot$. The nebular spectra of SN 2017ivv show a remarkable transformation\nthat allows the evolution to be split into three phases: (1) H$\\alpha$ strong\nphase ($<200$ days); (2) H$\\alpha$ weak phase (between 200 and 350 days); and\n(3) H$\\alpha$ broad phase ($>500$ days). We find that the nebular analysis\nfavours a binary progenitor and an asymmetric explosion. Finally, comparing the\nnebular spectra of SN 2017ivv to models suggests a progenitor with a zero-age\nmain-sequence mass of 15 -- 17 \\Msun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 18:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

And, indeed, the average distance travelled to churches\nin the US rose by 13% over the same period.

To solve the optimization problem a steepest descent\nalgorithm using shape derivatives is applied. In each iteration the cut finite\nelement method is used to obtain high accuracy approximations of the pde-model\nconstraint for a given level set configuration without re-meshing. We consider\nthree different shape derivatives. First the classical one, derived using the\ncontinuous optimization problem (optimize then discretize). Then the functional\nis first discretized using the CutFEM method and the shape derivative is\nevaluated on the finite element functional (discretize then optimize). Finally\nwe consider a third approach, also using a discretized functional. In this case\nwe do not perturb the domain, but consider a so-called boundary value\ncorrection method, where a small correction to the boundary position may be\nincluded in the weak boundary condition. Using this correction the shape\nderivative may be obtained by perturbing a distance parameter in the discrete\nvariational formulation. The theoretical discussion is illustrated with a\nseries of numerical examples showing that all three approaches produce similar\nresult on the proposed Bernoulli problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 20:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

To ensure safe operations in these\nsituations, usually perceptually degraded and without good GNSS, it is critical\nto have a reliable and robust state estimation solution. The main body of\nliterature in robot state estimation focuses on developing complex algorithms\nfavoring accuracy. Typically, these approaches rely on a strong underlying\nassumption: the main estimation engine will not fail during operation. In\ncontrast, we propose an architecture that pursues robustness in state\nestimation by considering redundancy and heterogeneity in both sensing and\nestimation algorithms. The architecture is designed to expect and detect\nfailures and adapt the behavior of the system to ensure safety. To this end, we\npresent HeRO (Heterogeneous Redundant Odometry): a stack of estimation\nalgorithms running in parallel supervised by a resiliency logic. This logic\ncarries out three main functions: a) perform confidence tests both in data\nquality and algorithm health; b) re-initialize those algorithms that might be\nmalfunctioning; c) generate a smooth state estimate by multiplexing the inputs\nbased on their quality. The state and quality estimates are used by the\nguidance and control modules to adapt the mobility behaviors of the system.

The viscosity of strong liquids\nfollows an Arrhenius law with a temperature-independent barrier height to\nrearrangements responsible for relaxation, whereas fragile liquids experience a\nmuch faster increase in their dynamics, suggesting a barrier height that\nincreases with decreasing temperature. Strong glassformers are typically\nnetwork glasses, while fragile glassformers are typically molecular or\nhard-sphere-like.

In its most common formulation, ICA\nassumes that the signal matrix is a noiseless linear mixture of independent\nsources that are assumed non-Gaussian. A limitation is that it enforces to\nestimate as many sources as sensors or to rely on a detrimental PCA step.\n  Methods: We present the Spectral Matching ICA (SMICA) model. Signals are\nmodelled as a linear mixing of independent sources corrupted by additive noise,\nwhere sources and the noise are stationary Gaussian time series. Thanks to the\nGaussian assumption, the negative log-likelihood has a simple expression as a\nsum of divergences between the empirical spectral covariance matrices of the\nsignals and those predicted by the model.

Presented herein are measurements of the amplitudes of the first and\nsecond harmonic bands from four surface water wave laboratory experiments.\n  The Stokes expansion for small-amplitude surface water waves provides\npredictions for the amplitudes of the second and higher harmonics given the\namplitude of the first harmonic. Similarly, the derivations of the NLS equation\nand its generalizations (models for the evolution of weakly nonlinear,\nnarrow-banded waves) provide predictions for the second and third harmonic\nbands given measurements of the first harmonic band.

We apply this reasoning to the seven atomic\nmeasurements whose experimental accuracy is smaller than 10 kHz to provide\npredictions for nuclear-size effects whose theoretical accuracy is not subject\nto nuclear-modelling uncertainties and so are much smaller than 1 kHz.\nFurthermore, the accuracy of these predictions can improve as atomic\nmeasurements improve, allowing precision fundamental tests to become possible\nwell below the 'irreducible' error floor of nuclear theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 00:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 17:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 19:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Box tracks are annotated efficiently by approximating the\ntrajectory using a parametric curve with a small number of control points which\nthe annotator can interactively correct. Our approach tolerates a modest amount\nof noise in the box placements, thus typically only a few clicks are needed to\nannotate tracked boxes to a sufficient accuracy. Segmentation masks are\ncorrected via scribbles which are efficiently propagated through time. We show\nsignificant performance gains in annotation efficiency over past work.

However, the mining process requires high computational power,\nwhich prevents IoT devices from directly participating in blockchain\nconstruction. For this reason, edge computing service is introduced to help\nbuild the IoT blockchain, where IoT devices could purchase computational\nresources from the edge servers. In this paper, we consider the case that IoT\ndevices also have other tasks that need the help of edge servers, such as data\nanalysis and data storage. The profits they can get from these tasks is closely\nrelated to the amounts of resources they purchased from the edge servers. In\nthis scenario, IoT devices will allocate their limited budgets to purchase\ndifferent resources from different edge servers, such that their profits can be\nmaximized. Moreover, edge servers will set \"best\" prices such that they can get\nthe biggest benefits. Accordingly, there raise a pricing and budget allocation\nproblem between edge servers and IoT devices.

There has been in recent years a renewed\ninterest in the class of so-called non-local models, which include peridynamic\nmodels, for the simulation of structural mechanics problems as an alternative\napproach to classical local continuum models. However, a major issue, which is\noften disregarded when dealing with this class of models, is concerned with the\nmanner by which boundary conditions should be prescribed. Our point of view\nhere is that classical boundary conditions, since applied on surfaces of solid\nbodies, are naturally associated with local models. The paper describes two\nmethods to incorporate classical Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions into\nbond-based peridynamics. The first method consists in artificially extending\nthe domain with a thin boundary layer over which the displacement field is\nrequired to behave as an odd function with respect to the boundary points. The\nsecond method resorts to the idea that peridynamic models and local models\nshould be compatible in the limit that the so-called horizon vanishes. The\napproach consists then in decreasing the horizon from a constant value in the\ninterior of the domain to zero at the boundary so that one can directly apply\nthe classical boundary conditions. We present the continuous and discrete\nformulations of the two methods and assess their performance on several\nnumerical experiments dealing with the simulation of a one-dimensional bar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 00:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-02"}

More precisely, one can use the search volume\nof some search terms to predict the infection rate of an infectious disease in\nnearly real-time. However, conducting accurate and stable prediction of\noutbreaks using search engine logs is a challenging task due to the following\ntwo-way instability characteristics of the search logs. First, the search\nvolume of a search term may change irregularly in the short-term, for example,\ndue to environmental factors such as the amount of media or news. Second, the\nsearch volume may also change in the long-term due to the demographic change of\nthe search engine. That is to say, if a model is trained with such search logs\nwith ignoring such characteristic, the resulting prediction would contain\nserious mispredictions when these changes occur.\n  In this work, we proposed a novel feature selection method to overcome this\ninstability problem. In particular, we employ a seasonal-adjustment method that\ndecomposes each time series into three components: seasonal, trend and\nirregular component and build prediction models for each component\nindividually. We also carefully design a feature selection method to select\nproper search terms to predict each component. We conducted comprehensive\nexperiments on ten different kinds of infectious diseases. The experimental\nresults show that the proposed method outperforms all comparative methods in\nprediction accuracy for seven of ten diseases, in both now-casting and\nforecasting setting. Also, the proposed method is more successful in selecting\nsearch terms that are semantically related to target diseases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 01:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

However, DIP suffers from the\nsemi-convergence behavior, i.e., the iteration of DIP needs to terminate by\nreferring to the ground-truth image at the optimal iteration point. In this\npaper, we propose the spatial-spectral constrained deep image prior (S2DIP) for\nHSI mixed noise removal. Specifically, we incorporate DIP with a\nspatial-spectral total variation (SSTV) term to fully preserve the\nspatial-spectral local smoothness of the HSI and an $\\ell_1$-norm term to\ncapture the complex sparse noise. The proposed S2DIP jointly leverages the\nexpressive power brought from the deep CNN without any training data and\nexploits the HSI and noise structures via hand-crafted priors. Thus, our method\navoids the semi-convergence behavior, showing higher stabilities than DIP.\nMeanwhile, our method largely enhances the HSI denoising ability of DIP.

The combined use of dual-energy CT and\npositron emission tomography (PET) may provide a more comprehensive\ncharacterization of disease states in cancer and many other diseases. However,\nthe integration of dual-energy CT with PET is not trivial, either requiring\ncostly hardware upgrade or increasing radiation dose. This paper proposes a\nnovel dual-energy CT imaging method that is enabled by the already-available\nPET data on PET/CT. Instead of using a second X-ray CT scan with a different\nenergy, this method exploits time-of-flight PET image reconstruction via the\nmaximum likelihood attenuation and activity (MLAA) algorithm to obtain a 511\nkeV gamma-ray attenuation image from PET emission data. The high-energy\ngamma-ray CT image is then combined with the low-energy X-ray CT of PET/CT to\nprovide a pair of dual-energy CT images. A major challenge with the standard\nMLAA reconstruction is the high noise present in the reconstructed 511 keV\nattenuation map, which does not compromise the PET activity reconstruction too\nmuch but significantly affects the performance of the gamma-ray CT for material\ndecomposition. To overcome the problem, we further propose a kernel MLAA\nalgorithm to exploit the prior information from the available X-ray CT image.\nWe conducted a computer simulation to test the concept and algorithm for the\ntask of material decomposition. The simulation results indicate that this\nPET-enabled dual-energy CT method is promising for quantitative material\ndecomposition. The proposed method can be readily implemented on time-of-flight\nPET/CT scanners to enable simultaneous PET and dual-energy CT imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 04:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

The resulting model is purely data-driven and\nleverages features of the multiscale dynamics, enabling numerical integration\nand forecasting that is both accurate and highly efficient. Moreover, similar\nideas can be used to couple neural network-based models with classical\nnumerical time-steppers. Our multiscale hierarchical time-stepping scheme\nprovides important advantages over current time-stepping algorithms, including\n(i) circumventing numerical stiffness due to disparate time-scales, (ii)\nimproved accuracy in comparison with leading neural-network architectures,\n(iii) efficiency in long-time simulation/forecasting due to explicit training\nof slow time-scale dynamics, and (iv) a flexible framework that is\nparallelizable and may be integrated with standard numerical time-stepping\nalgorithms.

Yet,\ndespite being the golden standard, the connection of the sensors and the\nunfamiliar environment inevitably impact the quality of the patient's sleep and\nthe examination itself.

These methods utilize different techniques with the purpose to extract\nthe same sleep parameters, but remotely, eliminating the need of any physical\nconnections to the patient's body.

This\nsetting has applications to mathematical physics through the use of model\ntheory (non-standard analysis) in the studying of homomorphisms between groups\nof symplectomorphisms and automorphisms of the Weyl algebra.

At room pressure the system is a semiconductor with small band-gap,\nand the valence and conduction bands present a parabolic conventional\ndispersion. However around 2 GPa the parabolic shape of the bands become linear\nand touch at the Fermi level. This means that this compound undergoes a\npressure-induced topological phase transition to a 3D analog of graphene, known\nas a 3D Dirac semi-metal, with gapless electronic excitations. At increasing\npressures the gap reopens and variation of the character of the electronic\nband-gap from direct to indirect is evidenced. At 7 GPa we observe the\nformation of a negative band-gap character, which persists for pressures up to\n12 GPa. Topological insulating features are evidenced from 2 to 12 GPa with a\nZ$_4$=3 topological index. Moreover by investigating the lattice\nthermal-conductivity at different pressures, we observe an ultra low value of\n$\\kappa_\\textrm{L}$ at 300 K for 0.5 GPa (0.294 and 0.486 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ for\nthe $x$-$y$-axis and for the $z$-axis, respectively) which is the result of\nexisting low-frequency optical modes. At 2 GPa $\\kappa_\\textrm{L}$ increases to\n1.170 and 0.669 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, for the $x$-$y$-axis and for the $z$-axis,\nrespectively. At 4 GPa the thermal-conductivity values between the two distinct\ncrystallographic axis tend to approximate, with 1.495 and 1.433\nWm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, along the $x$-$y$-axis and the $z$-axis, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 10:34:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 13:19:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

The model involves both turbulent fragmentation and competitive\naccretion. Turbulent fragmentation creates low-mass seed proto-systems (i.e.\nsingle and multiple protostars). Some of these low-mass seed proto-systems then\ngrow by competitive accretion to produce the high-mass power-law tail of the\nSMF. Turbulent fragmentation is relatively inefficient, in the sense that the\ncreation of low-mass seed proto-systems only consumes a fraction, $\\sim 23\\%$\n(at most $\\sim 50\\%$), of the mass available for star formation. The remaining\nmass is consumed by competitive accretion.

If the rate of supply of mass accelerates, the rate of proto-system\nformation also accelerates, as appears to be observed in many clusters.\nHowever, even if the rate of supply of mass decreases, or ceases and then\nresumes, the SMF evolves homologously, retaining the same overall shape, and\nthe high-mass power-law tail simply extends to ever higher masses until the\nsupply of gas runs out completely.

A radical solution is to augment the tail classes with\nhigher diversity. To this end, we introduce a simple and reliable method named\nMemory-based Jitter (MBJ). We observe that during training, the deep model\nconstantly changes its parameters after every iteration, yielding the\nphenomenon of \\emph{weight jitters}. Consequentially, given a same image as the\ninput, two historical editions of the model generate two different features in\nthe deeply-embedded space, resulting in \\emph{feature jitters}. Using a memory\nbank, we collect these (model or feature) jitters across multiple training\niterations and get the so-called Memory-based Jitter. The accumulated jitters\nenhance the within-class diversity for the tail classes and consequentially\nimproves long-tailed visual recognition. With slight modifications, MBJ is\napplicable for two fundamental visual recognition tasks, \\emph{i.e.}, deep\nimage classification and deep metric learning (on long-tailed data).

One of the major bottlenecks of\nthis platform is the weak coupling strength between adjacent atoms, which\nlimits the speed of two-qubit gates. Here, we present a method to perform a\nfast universal square-root-SWAP gate with fermionic atoms. The basic idea of\nthe gate is to release the atoms into a harmonic potential positioned in\nbetween the two atoms. By properly tailoring the interaction parameter, the\ncollision process between the atoms generates entanglement and yields the\ndesired gate. We prove analytically that in the limit of broad atomic\nwave-packets, the fidelity of the gate approaches unity. We demonstrate\nnumerically that with typical experimental parameters, our gate can operate on\na microsecond timescale and achieves a fidelity higher than 0.998. Moreover,\nthe gate duration is independent of the initial distance between the atoms. A\ngate with such features is an important milestone towards all-to-all\nconnectivity and fault tolerance in quantum computation with neutral atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 12:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

One of the challenges in training a DNN is\nits need to be fed by an enriched dataset to increase its accuracy and avoid it\nsuffering from overfitting. One way to improve the generalization of DNNs is to\naugment the training data with new synthesized adversarial samples. Recently,\nresearchers have worked extensively to propose methods for data augmentation.\nIn this paper, we generate adversarial samples to refine the Domains of\nAttraction (DoAs) of each class. In this approach, at each stage, we use the\nmodel learned by the primary and generated adversarial data (up to that stage)\nto manipulate the primary data in a way that look complicated to the DNN. The\nDNN is then retrained using the augmented data and then it again generates\nadversarial data that are hard to predict for itself. As the DNN tries to\nimprove its accuracy by competing with itself (generating hard samples and then\nlearning them), the technique is called Self-Competitive Neural Network (SCNN).\nTo generate such samples, we pose the problem as an optimization task, where\nthe network weights are fixed and use a gradient descent based method to\nsynthesize adversarial samples that are on the boundary of their true labels\nand the nearest wrong labels. Our experimental results show that data\naugmentation using SCNNs can significantly increase the accuracy of the\noriginal network. As an example, we can mention improving the accuracy of a CNN\ntrained with 1000 limited training data of MNIST dataset from 94.26% to 98.25%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 12:28:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

Using Monte-Carlo\nradiative transfer we produce synthetic ALMA observations of these discs. In\ndoing so we demonstrate that our model is capable of producing observational\npredictions, and able to model real image data of potentially self-gravitating\ndiscs. For a disc to generate spiral structure that would be observable with\nALMA requires that the disc's dust mass budget is dominated by millimetre and\ncentimetre-sized grains. Discs in which grains have grown to the grain\nfragmentation threshold may satisfy this criterion, thus we predict that\nsignatures of gravitational instability may be detectable in discs of lower\nmass than has previously been suggested. For example, we find that discs with\ndisc-to-star mass ratios as low as $0.10$ are capable of driving observable\nspiral arms. Substructure becomes challenging to detect in discs where no grain\ngrowth has occurred or in which grain growth has proceeded well beyond the\ngrain fragmentation threshold.

Since the two jets\nproduced in the decay of a highly Lorentz-boosted Higgs or Z boson can merge to\nform a single jet, nine independent analyses are performed, categorized by the\nnumber of observed jets and the reconstructed event mode. No signal in excess\nof the expected background is observed. Lower limits are set on the VLQ mass at\n95% confidence level equal to 1570 GeV in the case where the VLQ decays\nexclusively to a b quark and a Higgs boson, 1390 GeV for when it decays\nexclusively to a b quark and a Z boson, and 1450 GeV for when it decays equally\nin these two modes. These limits represent significant improvements over the\npreviously published VLQ limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 13:37:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 01:16:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

Pre-defined anchors set prior about the location and\nduration for action instances, which facilitates the localization for common\naction instances but limits the flexibility for tackling action instances with\ndrastic varieties, especially for extremely short or extremely long ones. To\naddress this problem, this paper proposes a novel anchor-free action\nlocalization module that assists action localization by temporal points.\nSpecifically, this module represents an action instance as a point with its\ndistances to the starting boundary and ending boundary, alleviating the\npre-defined anchor restrictions in terms of action localization and duration.\nThe proposed anchor-free module is capable of predicting the action instances\nwhose duration is either extremely short or extremely long. By combining the\nproposed anchor-free module with a conventional anchor-based module, we propose\na novel action localization framework, called A2Net. The cooperation between\nanchor-free and anchor-based modules achieves superior performance to the\nstate-of-the-art on THUMOS14 (45.5% vs. 42.8%). Furthermore, comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate the complementarity between the anchor-free and the\nanchor-based module, making A2Net simple but effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 13:39:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

The key to obtain differentially\nprivate models is to introduce noise/randomness to the training process. In\nparticular, existing differentially private machine learning methods add noise\nto the training data, the gradients, the loss function, and/or the model\nitself. Bagging, a popular ensemble learning framework, randomly creates some\nsubsamples of the training data, trains a base model for each subsample using a\nbase learner, and takes majority vote among the base models when making\npredictions. Bagging has intrinsic randomness in the training process as it\nrandomly creates subsamples. Our major theoretical results show that such\nintrinsic randomness already makes Bagging differentially private without the\nneeds of additional noise. In particular, we prove that, for any base learner,\nBagging with and without replacement respectively achieves $\\left(N\\cdot k\n\\cdot \\ln{\\frac{n+1}{n}},1- (\\frac{n-1}{n})^{N\\cdot k}\\right)$-differential\nprivacy and $\\left(\\ln{\\frac{n+1}{n+1-N\\cdot k}}, \\frac{N\\cdot k}{n}\n\\right)$-differential privacy, where $n$ is the training data size, $k$ is the\nsubsample size, and $N$ is the number of base models.

In the field of Non-Intrusive Load\nMonitoring (NILM), performance evaluation can be conducted on real-world\naggregate signals, provided by smart energy meters or artificial superpositions\nof individual load signals (i.e., denoised aggregates). It has long been\nsuspected that testing on these denoised aggregates provides better evaluation\nresults mainly due to the the fact that the signal is less complex. Complexity\nin real-world aggregate signals increases with the number of unknown/untracked\nload. Although this is a known performance reporting problem, an investigation\nin the actual performance gap between real and denoised testing is still\npending. In this paper, we examine the performance gap between testing on\nreal-world and denoised aggregates with the aim of bringing clarity into this\nmatter.

We give broad insights into our\nevaluation setup comprising three load disaggregation algorithms, two of them\nrelying on neural network architectures.

This property, which so far has\nremained under the radar, implies that deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nmethods becomes ineffective when trained under congested conditions, and might\nexplain DRL's limited success for traffic signal control. Our results apply to\nall possible grid networks thanks to a parametrization based on two network\nparameters: the ratio of the expected distance between consecutive traffic\nlights to the expected green time, and the turning probability at\nintersections. Networks with different parameters exhibit very different\nresponses to traffic signal control. Notably, we found that no control (i.e.\nrandom policy) can be an effective control strategy for a surprisingly large\nfamily of networks. The impact of the turning probability turned out to be very\nsignificant both for baseline and for DRL policies.

We also explore the fix durations of ad\nissues across platforms for extracting insights into prioritizing ad issues for\nad maintenance.\n  We summarize 15 types of ad issues by manually annotating 903/36,309\nad-related user reviews. From a statistical analysis of 36,309 ad-related\nreviews, we find that users care most about the number of unique ads and ad\ndisplay frequency during usage. Besides, users tend to give relatively lower\nratings when they report the security and notification related issues.\nRegarding different platforms, we observe that the distributions of ad issues\nare significantly different between App Store and Google Play. Moreover, some\nad issue types are addressed more quickly by developers than other ad issues.\nWe believe the findings we discovered can benefit app developers towards\nbalancing ad revenue and user experience while ensuring app reliability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 05:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

Previously, the traditional time series models were used to\nforecast travel demand, such as AR, ARIMA and so on. However, the prediction\nefficiency of these methods is poor and the training time is too long. In order\nto improve the performance, deep learning is used to assist prediction. But\nmost of the deep learning methods only utilize temporal dependence or spatial\ndependence of data in the forecasting process. To address these limitations, a\nnovel deep learning traffic demand forecasting framework which based on Deep\nSpatio-Temporal ConvLSTM is proposed in this paper. In order to evaluate the\nperformance of the framework, an end-to-end deep learning system is designed\nand a real dataset is used. Furthermore, the proposed method can capture\ntemporal dependence and spatial dependence simultaneously. The closeness,\nperiod and trend components of spatio-temporal data are used in three predicted\nbranches. These branches have the same network structures, but do not share\nweights. Then a linear fusion method is used to get the final result.

As a heterogenous network model,\nONNs are based on a generalized neuron model that can encapsulate any set of\nnon-linear operators to boost diversity and to learn highly complex and\nmulti-modal functions or spaces with minimal network complexity and training\ndata. However, the default search method to find optimal operators in ONNs, the\nso-called Greedy Iterative Search (GIS) method, usually takes several training\nsessions to find a single operator set per layer. This is not only\ncomputationally demanding, also the network heterogeneity is limited since the\nsame set of operators will then be used for all neurons in each layer. To\naddress this deficiency and exploit a superior level of heterogeneity, in this\nstudy the focus is drawn on searching the best-possible operator set(s) for the\nhidden neurons of the network based on the Synaptic Plasticity paradigm that\nposes the essential learning theory in biological neurons. During training,\neach operator set in the library can be evaluated by their synaptic plasticity\nlevel, ranked from the worst to the best, and an elite ONN can then be\nconfigured using the top ranked operator sets found at each hidden layer.\nExperimental results over highly challenging problems demonstrate that the\nelite ONNs even with few neurons and layers can achieve a superior learning\nperformance than GIS-based ONNs and as a result the performance gap over the\nCNNs further widens.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 19:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-21"}
