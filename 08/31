Such a\nbehaviour is often achieved through instability-induced transformations of the\nunderlying periodic microstructure into one or multiple patterning modes. Due\nto a strong kinematic coupling of individual repeating microstructural cells,\nnon-local behaviour and size effects emerge, which cannot easily be captured by\nclassical homogenization schemes. In addition, the individual patterning modes\ncan mutually interact in space as well as in time, while at the engineering\nscale the entire structure can buckle globally. For efficient numerical\nmacroscale predictions, a micromorphic computational homogenization scheme has\nrecently been developed. Although this framework is in principle capable of\naccounting for spatial and temporal interactions between individual patterning\nmodes, its implementation relied on a gradient-based quasi-Newton solution\ntechnique. This solver is suboptimal because (i) it has sub-quadratic\nconvergence, and (ii) the absence of Hessians does not allow for proper\nbifurcation analyses. Given that mechanical metamaterials often rely on\ncontrolled instabilities, these limitations are serious. To address them, a\nfull Newton method is provided in detail in this paper. The construction of the\nmacroscopic tangent operator is not straightforward due to specific model\nassumptions on the decomposition of the underlying displacement field pertinent\nto the micromorphic framework, involving orthogonality constraints. Analytical\nexpressions for the first and second variation of the total potential energy\nare given, and the complete algorithm is listed. The developed methodology is\ndemonstrated with two examples in which a competition between local and global\nbuckling exists and where multiple patterning modes emerge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 11:06:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 14:03:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}

Here, we test whether this strong view is warranted by simulating\n100000 years of cultural and biological evolution in various scenarios. We\nmodelled disgust as a trait that governed the extent to which individuals\nforewent potentially contaminated nutrition.

As environmental levels and costs of contamination rose, so did\nrelative fitness of high-disgust individuals.

This can be attributed to the fact that current\nstate-of-the-art, end-to-end reinforcement learning approaches still require\nthousands or millions of data samples to converge to a satisfactory policy and\nare subject to catastrophic failures during training. Conversely, in real world\nscenarios and after just a few data samples, humans are able to either provide\ndemonstrations of the task, intervene to prevent catastrophic actions, or\nsimply evaluate if the policy is performing correctly.

In this study, we extend\nLAVSE to improve its ability to address three practical issues often\nencountered in implementing AVSE systems, namely, the additional cost of\nprocessing visual data, audio-visual asynchronization, and low-quality visual\ndata. The proposed system is termed improved LAVSE (iLAVSE), which uses a\nconvolutional recurrent neural network architecture as the core AVSE model.

However, further\nintegration of industrial robots is hampered by their limited flexibility,\nadaptability and decision making skills compared to human operators. Assembly\ntasks are especially challenging for robots since they are contact-rich and\nsensitive to even small uncertainties. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers\na promising framework to learn contact-rich control policies from scratch, its\napplicability to high-dimensional continuous state-action spaces remains rather\nlimited due to high brittleness and sample complexity. To address those issues,\nwe propose different pruning methods that facilitate convergence and\ngeneralization. In particular, we divide the task into free and contact-rich\nsub-tasks, perform the control in Cartesian rather than joint space, and\nparameterize the control policy. Those pruning methods are naturally\nimplemented within the framework of dynamic movement primitives (DMP). To\nhandle contact-rich tasks, we extend the DMP framework by introducing a\ncoupling term that acts like the human wrist and provides active compliance\nunder contact with the environment. We demonstrate that the proposed method can\nlearn insertion skills that are invariant to space, size, shape, and closely\nrelated scenarios, while handling large uncertainties. Finally we demonstrate\nthat the learned policy can be easily transferred from simulations to real\nworld and achieve similar performance on UR5e robot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Aug 2020 17:29:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2020 17:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

However,\nthe bottleneck of indexing a large number of dense vectors and performing an\nNNS hurts the query time and accuracy of these models. In this paper, we argue\nthat high-dimensional and ultra-sparse embedding is a significantly superior\nalternative to dense low-dimensional embedding for both query efficiency and\naccuracy. Extreme sparsity eliminates the need for NNS by replacing them with\nsimple lookups, while its high dimensionality ensures that the embeddings are\ninformative even when sparse. However, learning extremely high dimensional\nembeddings leads to blow up in the model size. To make the training feasible,\nwe propose a partitioning algorithm that learns such high dimensional\nembeddings across multiple GPUs without any communication.

The label vectors are random, sparse, and near-orthogonal\nby design, while the query vectors are learned and sparse.

There are a large number\nof educational data mining studies that preprocess data through conventional\ndata mining processes including data preparation process, but they are using\ntranscript data as they stand without looking at examination and coursework\nresults weighting which could affect prediction accuracy. This paper proposes a\ndifferent data preparation process through investigating more than 230000\nstudent records in order to prepare students marks based on the assessment\nmethods of enrolled modules. The data have been processed through different\nstages in order to extract a categorical factor through which students module\nmarks are refined during the data preparation process.

Therefore, an attribute, coursework assessment\nratio, is proposed to be used in order to take the different modules assessment\nmethods into account while preparing student transcript data.

As~an alternative to the six-year\ngraduation rate method, many studies have applied absorbing Markov chains for\nestimating graduation rates. In both cases, a frequentist approach is used.\nFor~the standard six-year graduation rate method, the frequentist approach\ncorresponds to counting the number of students who finished their program\nwithin six years and dividing by the number of students who entered that year.\nIn the case of absorbing Markov chains, the frequentist approach is used to\ncompute the underlying transition matrix, which is then used to estimate the\ngraduation rate. In this paper, we apply a sensitivity analysis to compare the\nperformance of the standard six-year graduation rate method with that of\nabsorbing Markov chains. Through the analysis, we highlight significant\nlimitations with regards to the estimation accuracy of both approaches when\napplied to small sample sizes or cohorts at a university.

Most of the polymer solutions\nused every day life employ linear chains; their behaviour is accurately\ncaptured by the reptation and tube theories which connect microscopic TCs to\nmacroscopic viscoelasticity. On the other hand, polymers with non-trivial\ntopology, such as rings, hold great promise for new technology but pose a\nchallenging problem as they do not obey standard theories; additionally,\ntopological invariance -- i.e. the fact that rings must remain unknotted and\nunlinked if prepared so -- precludes any serious analytical treatment. Here we\npropose an unambiguous, parameter-free algorithm to characterise TCs in\npolymeric solutions and show its power in characterising TCs of entnagled\nrings. We analyse large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations via\npersistent homology, a key mathematical tool to extract robust topological\ninformation from large datasets. This method allows us to identify\nring-specific TCs which we call \"homological threadings\" (H-threadings) and to\nconnect them to the polymers' behaviour. It also allows us to identify, in a\nphysically appealing and unambiguous way, scale-dependent loops which have\neluded precise quantification so far. We discover that while threaded\nneighbours slowly grow with the rings' length, the ensuing TCs are extensive\nalso in the asymptotic limit. Our proposed method is not restricted to ring\npolymers and can find broader applications for the study of TCs in generic\npolymeric materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 02:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

Conversely,\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) are biased more towards texture. This is\nperhaps the main reason why CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Here,\nwe explore how shape bias can be incorporated into CNNs to improve their\nrobustness. Two algorithms are proposed, based on the observation that edges\nare invariant to moderate imperceptible perturbations. In the first one, a\nclassifier is adversarially trained on images with the edge map as an\nadditional channel. At inference time, the edge map is recomputed and\nconcatenated to the image. In the second algorithm, a conditional GAN is\ntrained to translate the edge maps, from clean and/or perturbed images, into\nclean images. Inference is done over the generated image corresponding to the\ninput's edge map. Extensive experiments over 10 datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithms against FGSM and $\\ell_\\infty$ PGD-40\nattacks. Further, we show that a) edge information can also benefit other\nadversarial training methods, and b) CNNs trained on edge-augmented inputs are\nmore robust against natural image corruptions such as motion blur, impulse\nnoise and JPEG compression, than CNNs trained solely on RGB images.

To address this problem, we\npropose DeepFacePencil, an effective tool that is able to generate\nphoto-realistic face images from hand-drawn sketches, based on a novel dual\ngenerator image translation network during training. A novel spatial attention\npooling (SAP) is designed to adaptively handle stroke distortions which are\nspatially varying to support various stroke styles and different levels of\ndetails. We conduct extensive experiments and the results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our model over existing methods on both image quality and model\ngeneralization to hand-drawn sketches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 03:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

Different from\ntraditional closed set learning, CIL has two main challenges: 1) Novel class\ndetection. The initial training data only contains incomplete classes, and\nstreaming test data will accept unknown classes. Therefore, the model needs to\nnot only accurately classify known classes, but also effectively detect unknown\nclasses; 2) Model expansion. After the novel classes are detected, the model\nneeds to be updated without re-training using entire previous data. However,\ntraditional CIL methods have not fully considered these two challenges, first,\nthey are always restricted to single novel class detection each phase and\nembedding confusion caused by unknown classes. Besides, they also ignore the\ncatastrophic forgetting of known categories in model update. To this end, we\npropose a Class-Incremental Learning without Forgetting (CILF) framework, which\naims to learn adaptive embedding for processing novel class detection and model\nupdate in a unified framework. In detail, CILF designs to regularize\nclassification with decoupled prototype based loss, which can improve the\nintra-class and inter-class structure significantly, and acquire a compact\nembedding representation for novel class detection in result. Then, CILF\nemploys a learnable curriculum clustering operator to estimate the number of\nsemantic clusters via fine-tuning the learned network, in which curriculum\noperator can adaptively learn the embedding in self-taught form. Therefore,\nCILF can detect multiple novel classes and mitigate the embedding confusion\nproblem. Last, with the labeled streaming test data, CILF can update the\nnetwork with robust regularization to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting.\nConsequently, CILF is able to iteratively perform novel class detection and\nmodel update.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 04:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

In this paper, we\npropose to learn an Iou-aware Classification Score (IACS) as a joint\nrepresentation of object presence confidence and localization accuracy. We show\nthat dense object detectors can achieve a more accurate ranking of candidate\ndetections based on the IACS.

The NIHAO galaxies\nreproduce the SFMS and generally agree with observations, but the slope is\nabout unity and thus significantly larger than observed values. This is because\nobserved galaxies at large stellar masses, although still being part of the\nSFMS, are already influenced by quenching. This partial suppression of star\nformation by AGN feedback leads to lower star formation rates and therefore to\nlower observed slopes. We confirm that including the effects of AGN in our\ngalaxies leads to slopes in agreement with observations. We find the deviation\nof a galaxy from the SFMS is correlated with its $z=0$ dark matter halo\nconcentration and thus with its halo formation time. This means galaxies with a\nhigher-than-average star formation rate (SFR) form later and vice versa. We\nexplain this apparent correlation with the SFR by re-interpreting galaxies that\nlie above the SFMS (higher-than-average SFR) as lying to the left of the SFMS\n(lower-than-average stellar mass) and vice versa. Thus later forming haloes\nhave a lower-than-average stellar mass, this is simply because they have had\nless-than-average time to form stars, and vice versa. It is thus the nature,\ni.e. how and when these galaxies form, that sets the path of a galaxy in the\nSFR versus stellar mass plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 06:01:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2020 10:58:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

For chemical ages typical of dense clouds, our nominal model\nleads to two 13C reservoirs: CO and the species that derive from CO, mainly\ns-CO and s-CH3OH, as well as C3 in the gas phase.

The crystal structure of CuO consists\nof Cu motifs within CuO$_4$ square planar units and two elongated apical Cu-O\nbonds. The CuO$_4$ square planar units are stable in the studied pressure\nrange, with Cu-O distances that are approximately constant up to 5 GPa, and\nthen decrease slightly up to 17 GPa. In contrast, the elongated Cu-O apical\ndistances decrease continuously with pressure in the studied range. An\nanomalous increase of the mean square relative displacement (EXAFS Debye\nWaller, \\sigma$^2$) of the elongated Cu-O path is observed from 5 GPa up to 13\nGPa, when a drastic reduction takes place in \\sigma$^2$. This is interpreted in\nterms of local dynamic disorder along the apical Cu-O path. At higher pressures\n(P>13 GPa), the local structure of Cu$^{2+}$ changes from a 4-fold square\nplanar to a 4+2 Jahn-Teller distorted octahedral ion. We interpret these\nresults in terms of the tendency of the Cu$^{2+}$ ion to form favorable\ninteractions with the apical O atoms. Also, the decrease in Cu-O apical\ndistance caused by compression softens the normal mode associated with the\nout-of-plane Cu movement. CuO is predicted to have an anomalous rise in\npermittivity with pressure as well as modest piezoelectricity in the 5-13 GPa\npressure range. In addition, the near edge features in our XAS experiment show\na discontinuity and a change of tendency at 5 GPa. For P < 5 GPa the evolution\nof the edge shoulder is ascribed to purely electronic effects which also affect\nthe charge transfer integral. This is linked to a charge migration from the Cu\nto O, but also to an increase of the energy band gap, which show a change of\ntendency occurring also at 5 GPa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 08:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

We aim to\nuse multi-molecule line emission to infer NH2 from radio observations. We\npropose a data-driven approach to determine NH2 from radio molecular line\nobservations. We use supervised machine learning methods (Random Forests) on\nwide-field hyperspectral IRAM-30m observations of the Orion B molecular cloud\nto train a predictor of NH2, using a limited set of molecular lines as input,\nand the Herschel-based dust-derived NH2 as ground truth output. For conditions\nsimilar to the Orion B molecular cloud, we obtain predictions of NH2 within a\ntypical factor of 1.2 from the Herschel-based estimates. An analysis of the\ncontributions of the different lines to the predictions show that the most\nimportant lines are $^{13}$CO(1-0), $^{12}$CO(1-0), C$^{18}$O(1-0), and\nHCO$^+$(1-0).

This article opens a promising avenue to directly infer\nimportant physical parameters from the molecular line emission in the\nmillimeter domain.

Current\nstripe-based feature learning approaches have delivered impressive accuracy,\nbut do not make a proper trade-off between diversity, locality, and robustness,\nwhich easily suffers from part semantic inconsistency for the conflict between\nrigid partition and misalignment. This paper proposes a receptive\nmulti-granularity learning approach to facilitate stripe-based feature\nlearning. This approach performs local partition on the intermediate\nrepresentations to operate receptive region ranges, rather than current\napproaches on input images or output features, thus can enhance the\nrepresentation of locality while remaining proper local association. Toward\nthis end, the local partitions are adaptively pooled by using\nsignificance-balanced activations for uniform stripes.

One particular concern is that there is inherent correlation among\nnodes due to the structure of the network, thus requiring special care in this\nallocation. To this aim, our novel approach, called CoShare, is proposed.\nFirstly, its design takes into consideration the effect of network structural\ndependency, which might result in the unavailability of nodes of a network\nafter failure of a node. Secondly, to efficiently make use of resources,\nCoShare proposes the idea of shared reservation, where multiple flows may be\nallowed to share the same reserved backup capacity at an NF instance.\nFurthermore, CoShare factors in the heterogeneity in nodes, NF instances and\navailability requirements of flows in the design. The results from a number of\nexperiments conducted using realistic network topologies show that the\nintegration of structural dependency allows meeting availability requirements\nfor more flows compared to a baseline approach. Specifically, CoShare is able\nto meet diverse availability requirements in a resource-efficient manner,\nrequiring, e.g., up to 85% in some studied cases, less resource overbuild than\nthe baseline approach that uses the idea of dedicated reservation commonly\nadopted for redundancy allocation in NFV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 09:33:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 16:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Unlike the existing\nprivacy-preserving methods based on the ADMM where the primal or the dual\nvariables are perturbed with noise, the inherent randomness due to the use of a\nzeroth-order method endows D-ZOA with intrinsic differential privacy.

But catalyst are often non-stationary, they\nmay become activated under reaction conditions or become poisoned through use.\nIt is therefore desirable to develop methods with high data acquisition rates\nfor kinetics, so that transient rates can be measured on non-stationary\ncatalysts. In this work, we present velocity resolved kinetics using high\nrepetition rate pulsed laser ionization and high-speed ion imaging detection.\nThe reaction is initiated by molecular beam pulses incident at the surface and\nthe product formation rate is observed by a sequence of laser pulses at a high\nrepetition rate. Ion imaging provides the desorbing product flux (reaction\nrate) as a function of reaction time for each laser pulse. We demonstrate the\nmethod using a 10 Hz pulsed CO molecular beam pulse train to initiate CO\ndesorption from Pd(332) - desorbing CO is detected every millisecond by\nnon-resonant multiphoton ionization using a 1-kHz Ti:Sapphire laser. This\napproach overcomes the time-consuming scanning of the delay between CO and\nlaser pulses needed in past experiments and delivers a data acquisition rate\nthat is 10-1000 times higher.

Specifically, given an $n$-dimensional random variable\n$\\mathbf{X}$ and a target probability of failure $p_{e}$, an environmental\ncontour is the boundary of a set $\\mathcal{B} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the\nfollowing property: For any failure set $\\mathcal{F} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$,\nif $\\mathcal{F}$ does not intersect the interior of $\\mathcal{B}$, then the\nprobability of failure, $P(\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathcal{F})$, is bounded above by\n$p_{e}$.

As the suppression of turbulence leads to severe heat transfer\ndeterioration, this is an important and undesirable phenomenon in both heating\nand cooling applications. Vertical flow is often considered, as the axial\nbuoyancy force can help drive the flow. With heating measured by the buoyancy\nparameter $C$, our DNS show that shear-driven turbulence may either be\ncompletely laminarised or transitions to a relatively quiescent\nconvection-driven state. Buoyancy forces cause a flattening of the base flow\nprofile, which in isothermal pipe flow has recently been linked to complete\nsuppression of turbulence (K\\\"{u}hnen et al. Nat. Phys., 2018), and the\nflattened laminar base profile has enhanced nonlinear stability (Marensi et al.\nJFM, 2019). In agreement with these findings, the nonlinear lower-branch\ntravelling-wave solution analysed here, which is believed to mediate transition\nto turbulence in isothermal pipe flow, is shown to be suppressed by buoyancy. A\nlinear instability of the laminar base flow is responsible for the appearance\nof the relatively quiescent convection driven state for $C\\gtrsim 4$ across the\nrange of Reynolds numbers considered. In the suppression of turbulence,\nhowever, i.e. in the transition from turbulence, we find clearer association\nwith the analysis of He et al. (JFM, 2016) than with the above dynamical\nsystems approach, which describes better the transition to turbulence. The\nlaminarisation criterion He et al. propose, based on an apparent Reynolds\nnumber of the flow as measured by its driving pressure gradient, is found to\ncapture the critical $C=C_{cr}(Re)$ above which the flow will be laminarised or\nswitch to the convection-driven type. Our analysis suggests that it is the\nweakened rolls, rather than the streaks, which appear to be critical for\nlaminarisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 11:02:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 21:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

How-ever, developing such a model is challenge\nbecause it is difficult to determine the right combination of transfer learner\nand classifier along with their optimal hyper-parameter settings.

In particular, the bi-level programming proceeds the optimization\nwith two nested levels in a hierarchical manner.

We consider claims that the paper\nwas neither original nor important; we find that, by providing the first\nspecific analysis of the case of a dynamic cosmology without a cosmological\nconstant or spatial curvature, the authors delivered a unique, simple model\nwith a straightforward relation between cosmic expansion and the mean density\nof matter that set an important benchmark for both theorists and observers.

Instead, our approach performs a shorter training process with the new\ndata and a small subset of previous samples.

Though demonstrating promising performance in various\napplications, most of existing methods usually linearly combine a group of\npre-specified first-order Laplacian matrices to construct the optimal Laplacian\nmatrix, which may result in limited representation capability and insufficient\ninformation exploitation. Also, storing and implementing complex operations on\nthe $n\\times n$ Laplacian matrices incurs intensive storage and computation\ncomplexity. To address these issues, this paper first proposes a multi-view\nspectral clustering algorithm that learns a high-order optimal neighborhood\nLaplacian matrix, and then extends it to the late fusion version for accurate\nand efficient multi-view clustering. Specifically, our proposed algorithm\ngenerates the optimal Laplacian matrix by searching the neighborhood of the\nlinear combination of both the first-order and high-order base Laplacian\nmatrices simultaneously. By this way, the representative capacity of the\nlearned optimal Laplacian matrix is enhanced, which is helpful to better\nutilize the hidden high-order connection information among data, leading to\nimproved clustering performance. We design an efficient algorithm with proved\nconvergence to solve the resultant optimization problem.

The current\ninterfaces for map exploration require their users to zoom in and out\nfrequently. Indeed, zooming and panning are tools suitable for choosing the map\nextent corresponding to an area of interest. They are not as suitable, however,\nfor resolving the graphical clutter caused by a high feature density since\nzooming in to a large map scale leads to a loss of context. Therefore we\npresent new external labeling methods that allow navigating through dense sets\nof points of interest while keeping the current map extent fixed. We provide a\nunified model, in which labels are placed at the boundary of the map and\nvisually associated with the corresponding features via connecting lines, which\nare called leaders.

In these\nsystems, MDL/MDG must be accurately estimated for performance analysis and\ntroubleshooting. Most recent demonstrations of SDM with coupled channels\nperform MDL/MDG estimation by digital signal processing (DSP) techniques based\non the coefficients of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) adaptive\nequalizers.\n  Although these methods provide a valid indication of the order of magnitude\nof the accumulated MDL/MDG over the link, MIMO equalizers are usually updated\naccording to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion, which is known to\ndepend on the channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, MDL/MDG\nestimation techniques based on the adaptive filter coefficients are also\nimpaired by noise. In this paper, we model analytically the influence of the\nSNR on DSP-based MDL/MDG estimation, and show that the technique is prone to\nerrors. Based on the transfer function of MIMO MMSE equalizers, and assuming a\nknown SNR, we calculate a correction factor that improves the estimation\nprocess in moderate levels of MDL/MDG and SNR.

However, there are still challenges for the\nsuccessful integration of deep learning into medical imaging tasks due to a\nlack of large annotated imaging data. To address this issue, we propose a\nteacher-student learning framework to transfer knowledge from a carefully\npre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) teacher to a student CNN. In\nthis study, we explore the performance of knowledge transfer in the medical\nimaging setting. We investigate the proposed network's performance when the\nstudent network is trained on a small dataset (target dataset) as well as when\nteacher's and student's domains are distinct. The performances of the CNN\nmodels are evaluated on three medical imaging datasets including Diabetic\nRetinopathy, CheXpert, and ChestX-ray8. Our results indicate that the\nteacher-student learning framework outperforms transfer learning for small\nimaging datasets. Particularly, the teacher-student learning framework improves\nthe area under the ROC Curve (AUC) of the CNN model on a small sample of\nCheXpert (n=5k) by 4% and on ChestX-ray8 (n=5.6k) by 9%. In addition to small\ntraining data size, we also demonstrate a clear advantage of the\nteacher-student learning framework in the medical imaging setting compared to\ntransfer learning. We observe that the teacher-student network holds a great\npromise not only to improve the performance of diagnosis but also to reduce\noverfitting when the dataset is small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 12:58:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 21:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-21"}

However, these strategies remain secondary to most\nlearning approaches and suffer from time and computational intensive\nprocedures. We suggest a multiobjective perspective on the training of neural\nnetworks by treating its prediction accuracy and the network complexity as two\nindividual objective functions in a biobjective optimization problem. As a\nshowcase example, we use the cross entropy as a measure of the prediction\naccuracy while adopting an l1-penalty function to assess the total cost (or\ncomplexity) of the network parameters. The latter is combined with an\nintra-training pruning approach that reinforces complexity reduction and\nrequires only marginal extra computational cost. From the perspective of\nmultiobjective optimization, this is a truly large-scale optimization problem.\nWe compare two different optimization paradigms: On the one hand, we adopt a\nscalarization-based approach that transforms the biobjective problem into a\nseries of weighted-sum scalarizations. On the other hand we implement\nstochastic multi-gradient descent algorithms that generate a single Pareto\noptimal solution without requiring or using preference information. In the\nfirst case, favorable knee solutions are identified by repeated training runs\nwith adaptively selected scalarization parameters. Preliminary numerical\nresults on exemplary convolutional neural networks confirm that large\nreductions in the complexity of neural networks with neglibile loss of accuracy\nare possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 13:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

For\nvariables that do not have a finite domain, we can artificially introduce one\nby imposing a lower and an upper bound, and iteratively enlarge it until a\nsolution is found (or the procedure times out).\n  The key for the success of the approach is to determine, at each iteration,\nwhich domains have to be enlarged.

Our results with synthetic and real road networks reveal that their\nlevels of disorder, fractions of unidirectional segments and spatial\ncorrelations can drastically affect the vulnerability to traffic congestion.

Moreover, our analysis discloses that the origin\nof this difference comes from the intrinsic spatial correlations of each road\nnetwork.

One possible\nscenario is formation of massive stars ~ 1e3-1e4 Msun via runaway stellar\ncollisions in a dense cluster, leaving behind massive BHs without significant\nmass loss. We study the pulsational instability of massive stars with the\nzero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass Mzams/Msun = 300-3000 and metallicity Z/Zsun\n= 0-0.1, and discuss whether or not pulsation-driven mass loss prevents massive\nBH formation. In the MS phase, the pulsational instability excited by the\nepsilon-mechanism grows in ~ 1e3 yrs. As the stellar mass and metallicity\nincrease, the mass-loss rate increases to < 1e-3 Msun/yr. In the red\nsuper-giant (RSG) phase, the instability is excited by the kappa-mechanism\noperating in the hydrogen ionization zone and grows more rapidly in ~ 10 yrs.\nThe RSG mass-loss rate is almost independent of metallicity and distributes in\nthe range of ~ 1e-3-1e-2 Msun/yr.

Viewing $\\V$ as a representation of the $l$-Kronecker quiver $\\K_l$,\nEdmonds' problem can be rephrased as asking to decide if there exists a\nsemi-invariant on the representation space $(\\CC^{N\\times N})^l$ of weight\n$(1,-1)$ that does not vanish at $\\V$. In other words, Edmonds' problem is\nasking to decide if the weight $(1,-1)$ belongs to the orbit semigroup of $\\V$.\n  Let $Q$ be an arbitrary acyclic quiver and $\\V$ a representation of $Q$. We\nstudy the membership problem for the orbit semi-group of $\\V$ by focusing on\nthe so-called $\\V$-saturated weights.

While the hardness enhancement obtained whentwo\nmaterials form a superlattice is well described by existing models based on\ndislocation mobility, the underlying mechanisms behind the increase in fracture\ntoughness are yet to be unraveled. Here we provide a model based on linear\nelasticity theory to predict the fracture toughness enhancement in\n(semi-)epitaxial nanolayers due to coherency stresses and formation of misfit\ndislocations. We exemplarily study a superlattice structure composed of two\ncubic transition metal nitrides (TiN, CrN) on a MgO (100) single-crystal\nsubstrate. Minimization of the overall strain energy, each time a new layer is\nadded on the nanolayered stack, allows estimating the density of misfit\ndislocations formed at the interfaces. The evolving coherency stresses, which\nare partly relaxed by the misfit dislocations, are then used to calculate the\napparent fracture toughness of respective SL architectures by applying the\nweight function method. The results show that the critical stress intensity\nincreases steeply with increasing bilayer period for very thin (essentially\ndislocation-free) SLs, before the K_IC values decline more gently along with\nthe formation of misfit dislocations. The characteristic K_IC vs.\nbilayer-period-dependence nicely matches experimental trends. Importantly, all\ncritical stress intensity values of the superlattice films clearly exceed the\nintrinsic fracture toughness of the constituting layer materials, evincing the\nimportance of coherency stresses for increasing the crack growth resistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 14:41:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

The data is essentially curves and determining which trajectory should\nbe classified as extreme is not straight forward. To assess the extremes of the\ntraffic flow curves in a coherent way, we use a directional definition of\nextremeness and apply the dimension reduction technique called principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) in an asymmetric norm. In the classical PCA one\nreduces the dimensions of the data by projecting it in the direction of the\nlargest variation of the projection around its mean. In the PCA in an\nasymmetric norm one chooses the projection directions, such that the\nasymmetrically weighted variation around a tail index -- an expectile -- of the\ndata is the largest possible. Expectiles are tail measures that generalize the\nmean in a similar manner as quantiles generalize the median. Focusing on the\nasymmetrically weighted variation around an expectile of the data, we find the\nappropriate projection directions and the low dimensional representation of the\ntraffic flow profiles that uncover different patterns in their extremes.

The corresponding directional extremes of the\ntraffic flow profiles are simple to identify and to connect to their location-\nand time-related specifics. Their shapes are driven by their scores on each\nprincipal expectile component which is useful for extracting and analyzing\ntraffic patterns.

Using the replica method combined with a controlled triple\nepsilon expansion below four dimensions, we find a variety of new\nfinite-randomness critical and multicritical points with nonzero Yukawa\ncoupling between low-energy Dirac fields and bosonic order parameter\nfluctuations, and compute their universal critical exponents. Analyzing\nbifurcations of the renormalization-group flow, we find instances of the\nfixed-point annihilation scenario---continuously tuned by the power-law\nexponent of long-range disorder correlations and associated with an\nexponentially large crossover length---as well as the transcritical bifurcation\nand the supercritical Hopf bifurcation. The latter is accompanied by the birth\nof a stable limit cycle on the critical hypersurface, which represents the\nfirst instance of fermionic quantum criticality with emergent discrete scale\ninvariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 15:02:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 18:04:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-19"}

The traditional\nway of hiding military assets from sight is camouflage, for example by using\ncamouflage nets. However, large assets like planes or vessels are difficult to\nconceal by means of traditional camouflage nets. An alternative type of\ncamouflage is the direct misleading of automatic object detectors. Recently, it\nhas been observed that small adversarial changes applied to images of the\nobject can produce erroneous output by deep learning-based detectors. In\nparticular, adversarial attacks have been successfully demonstrated to prohibit\nperson detections in images, requiring a patch with a specific pattern held up\nin front of the person, thereby essentially camouflaging the person for the\ndetector. Research into this type of patch attacks is still limited and several\nquestions related to the optimal patch configuration remain open.\n  This work makes two contributions. First, we apply patch-based adversarial\nattacks for the use case of unmanned aerial surveillance, where the patch is\nlaid on top of large military assets, camouflaging them from automatic\ndetectors running over the imagery. The patch can prevent automatic detection\nof the whole object while only covering a small part of it. Second, we perform\nseveral experiments with different patch configurations, varying their size,\nposition, number and saliency. Our results show that adversarial patch attacks\nform a realistic alternative to traditional camouflage activities, and should\ntherefore be considered in the automated analysis of aerial surveillance\nimagery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 15:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

Two feedback mechanisms have been proposed to explain why\nthese channels grow by linear instability: shear flow of partially molten\nmantle and reactive flow of the ascending magma. These two mechanisms have been\nstudied extensively, in isolation from each other, through theory and\nlaboratory experiments as well as field and geophysical observations. Here, we\ndevelop a consistent theory that accounts for both proposed mechanisms and\nallows us to weigh their relative contributions. We show that interaction of\nthe two feedback mechanisms is insignificant and that the total linear growth\nrate of channels is well-approximated by summing their independent growth\nrates. Furthermore, we explain how their competition is governed by the\norientation of channels with respect to gravity and mantle shear. By itself,\nanalysis of the reaction-infiltration instability predicts the formation of\ntube-shaped channels. We show that with the addition of even a small amount of\nextension in the horizontal, the combined instability favours tabular channels,\nconsistent with the observed morphology of dunite bodies in ophiolites. We\napply the new theory to MORs by calculating the accumulated growth and rotation\nof channels along streamlines of the solid flow. We show that reactive flow is\nthe dominant mechanism deep beneath the ridge axis, where the most unstable\norientation of high-porosity channels is sub-vertical. Channels are then\nrotated by the solid flow away from the vertical.

The fast components are of stellar origin and\ndisappear in quiescence, while the slow component is less variable and could be\nrelated to a disk wind. The changes in the optical depth of the lines between\noutburst and quiescence are consistent with increased accretion being\nresponsible for the observed outburst. We derive an accretion rate of 10$^{-4}$\nM$_\\odot$/yr in outburst. The Fe I and weak Fe II lines arise from an\nirradiated, flared disk at $\\sim$0.5-3 $\\times$M$_*$/16M$_\\odot$ au with\nasymmetric upper layers, revealing that the energy from the accretion burst is\ndeposited at scales below 0.5 au. Some line profiles have redshifted\nasymmetries, but the system is unlikely sustained by magnetospheric accretion,\nespecially in outburst. The accretion-related structures extend over several\nstellar radii and, like the wind, are likely non-axisymmetric. The stellar mass\nmay be $\\sim$6-8 M$_\\odot$, lower than previously thought ($\\sim$16 M$_\\odot$).\nEmission line analysis is found to be a powerful tool to study the innermost\nregions and accretion in stars within a very large range of effective\ntemperatures. The density ranges in the disk and accretion structures are\nhigher than in late-type stars, but the overall behavior, including the\ninnermost disk emission and variable wind, is very similar independently of the\nspectral type. Our work suggests a common outburst behavior for stars with\nspectral types ranging from M-type to intermediate-mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 15:37:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 08:39:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 13:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

However, the number of\nreflected photons that interact with the brain is low when detecting blood flow\nin deep tissue. To tackle this photon-starved problem, we present and\ndemonstrate the idea of interferometric speckle visibility spectroscopy (ISVS).\nIn ISVS, an interferometric detection scheme is used to boost the weak signal\nlight. The blood flow dynamics are inferred from the speckle statistics of a\nsingle frame speckle pattern. We experimentally demonstrated the improvement of\nmeasurement fidelity by introducing interferometric detection when the signal\nphoton number is insufficient.

In this paper, graph\nmatching is considered under a stochastic model, where a pair of randomly\ngenerated graphs with pairwise correlated edges are to be matched such that\ngiven the labeling of the vertices in the first graph, the labels in the second\ngraph are recovered by leveraging the correlation among their edges. The\nproblem is considered under various settings and graph models.

A matching scheme called the\n\\textit{typicality matching scheme} is introduced. The scheme operates by\ninvestigating the joint typicality of the adjacency matrices of the two graphs.\nNew results on the typicality of permutations of sequences lead to necessary\nand sufficient conditions for successful matching based on the parameters of\nthe CER model. In the next step, the results are extended to graphs with\ncommunity structure generated based on the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). The\nSBM model is a generalization of the CER model where each vertex in the graph\nis associated with a community label, which affects its edge statistics. The\nresults are further extended to matching of ensembles of more than two\ncorrelated graphs.

However, when the sensors are exposed to harsh\nenvironmental conditions, the data measured by the SHM systems tend to be\naffected by multiple anomalies caused by faulty or broken sensors. Given a\ndeluge of high-dimensional data collected continuously over time, research into\nusing machine learning methods to detect anomalies are a topic of great\ninterest to the SHM community. This paper contributes to this effort by\nproposing the use of a relatively new time series representation named Shapelet\nTransform in combination with a Random Forest classifier to autonomously\nidentify anomalies in SHM data. The shapelet transform is a unique time series\nrepresentation that is solely based on the shape of the time series data. In\nconsideration of the individual characteristics unique to every anomaly, the\napplication of this transform yields a new shape-based feature representation\nthat can be combined with any standard machine learning algorithm to detect\nanomalous data with no manual intervention. For the present study, the anomaly\ndetection framework consists of three steps: identifying unique shapes from\nanomalous data, using these shapes to transform the SHM data into a local-shape\nspace and training machine learning algorithm on this transformed data to\nidentify anomalies. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated by the\nidentification of anomalies in acceleration data from a SHM system installed on\na long-span bridge in China. The results show that multiple data anomalies in\nSHM data can be automatically detected with high accuracy using the proposed\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 01:11:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 19:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

One area that ABM has rarely been applied is coalition formation.\nTraditionally, coalition formation is modeled using cooperative game theory. In\nthis paper, a heuristic algorithm is developed that can be embedded into an ABM\nto allow the agents to find coalition. The resultant coalition structures are\ncomparable to those found by cooperative game theory solution approaches,\nspecifically, the core. A heuristic approach is required due to the\ncomputational complexity of finding a cooperative game theory solution which\nlimits its application to about only a score of agents. The ABM paradigm\nprovides a platform in which simple rules and interactions between agents can\nproduce a macro-level effect without the large computational requirements. As\nsuch, it can be an effective means for approximating cooperative game solutions\nfor large numbers of agents. Our heuristic algorithm combines agent-based\nmodeling and cooperative game theory to help find agent partitions that are\nmembers of a games' core solution. The accuracy of our heuristic algorithm can\nbe determined by comparing its outcomes to the actual core solutions. This\ncomparison achieved by developing an experiment that uses a specific example of\na cooperative game called the glove game. The glove game is a type of exchange\neconomy game. Finding the traditional cooperative game theory solutions is\ncomputationally intensive for large numbers of players because each possible\npartition must be compared to each possible coalition to determine the core\nset; hence our experiment only considers games of up to nine players.

The ability to predict, anticipate and reason about future events\nis the essence of intelligence and one of the main goals of decision-making\nsystems such as human-machine interaction, robot navigation and autonomous\ndriving. However, the challenge lies in the ambiguous nature of the problem as\nthere may be multiple future sequences possible for the same input video shot.\nA naively designed model averages multiple possible futures into a single\nblurry prediction.\n  Recently, two distinct approaches have attempted to address this problem as:\n(a) use of latent variable models that represent underlying stochasticity and\n(b) adversarially trained models that aim to produce sharper images. A latent\nvariable model often struggles to produce realistic results, while an\nadversarially trained model underutilizes latent variables and thus fails to\nproduce diverse predictions. These methods have revealed complementary\nstrengths and weaknesses.

Here, we propose a modified\nmultiplicative decomposition model where the initial state (or reference\nconfiguration) of biological tissue is endowed with residual stress instead of\nbeing stress-free. Releasing theoretically the initial residual stress, the\ninitially stressed state is first transmitted into a virtual stress-free state,\nresulting in an initial elastic deformation. The initial virtual stress-free\nstate subsequently grows to another counterpart with a growth deformation and\nthe latter is further integrated into its natural configuration with an\nexcessive elastic deformation that ensures tissue compatibility. With this\ndecomposition, the total deformation may be expressed as the product of elastic\ndeformation, growth deformation and initial elastic deformation, while the\ncorresponding free energy density depends on the initial residual stress and\nthe total deformation. We address three key issues: explicit expression of the\nfree energy density,predetermination of the initial elastic deformation, and\ninitial residual stress. Finally, we consider a tubular organ to demonstrate\nthe effects of the proposed initial residual stress on stress distribution and\non shape formation through an incremental stability analysis.
