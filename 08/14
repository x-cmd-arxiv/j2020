However, identifying their progenitors has remained an\noutstanding open question in astrophysics. Studies of SN host galaxies have\nproven to be powerful in providing constraints on the progenitor populations.\nIn this paper, we present all CCSNe detected between 2009 and 2017 by the\nPalomar Transient Factory. This sample includes 888 SNe of 12 distinct classes\nout to redshift $z\\approx1$. We present the photometric properties of their\nhost galaxies from the far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared and model the\nhost-galaxy spectral energy distributions to derive physical properties. The\ngalaxy mass functions of Type Ic, Ib, IIb, II, and IIn SNe ranges from $10^{5}$\nto $10^{11.5}~M_\\odot$, probing the entire mass range of star-forming galaxies\ndown to the least-massive star-forming galaxies known. Moreover, the galaxy\nmass distributions are consistent with models of star-formation-weighted mass\nfunctions. Regular CCSNe are hence direct tracers of star formation. Small but\nnotable differences exist between some of the SN classes. Type Ib/c SNe prefer\ngalaxies with slightly higher masses (i.e., higher metallicities) and\nstar-formation rates than Type IIb and II SNe. These differences are less\npronounced than previously thought. H-poor SLSNe and SNe~Ic-BL are scarce in\ngalaxies above $10^{10}~M_\\odot$. Their progenitors require environments with\nmetallicities of $<0.4$ and $<1$ solar, respectively. In addition, the hosts of\nH-poor SLSNe are dominated by a younger stellar population than all other\nclasses of CCSNe. Our findings corroborate the notion that low-metallicity\n\\textit{and} young age play an important role in the formation of SLSN\nprogenitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 16:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

The pseudo-energy conservation is established under exact force\nintegration, whereas it is valid to second-order accuracy in the presence of\nquadrature errors. Moreover, we devise an asynchronous version of the scheme\nthat can be used in the framework of slow-fast time-stepping strategies.

Cloth masks\nare widely believed to impede droplet and aerosol transmission but most are\nconstructed from materials with unknown filtration efficiency, airflow\nresistance and water resistance. Further, there has been no clear guidance on\nthe most important performance metrics for the materials used by the general\npublic (as opposed to high-risk healthcare settings). Here we provide data on a\nrange of common fabrics that might be used to construct masks. None of the\nmaterials were suitable for masks meeting the N95 NIOSH standard, but many\ncould provide useful filtration (>90%) of 3 micron particles (a plausible\nchallenge size for human generated aerosols), with low pressure drop. These\nwere: nonwoven sterile wraps, dried baby wipes and some double-knit cotton\nmaterials. Decontamination of N95 masks using isopropyl alcohol produces the\nexpected increase in particle penetration, but for 3 micron particles,\nfiltration efficiency is still well above 95%. Tightly woven thin fabrics,\ndespite having the visual appearance of a good particle barrier, had remarkably\nlow filtration efficiency and high pressure drop. These differences in\nfiltration performance can be partly explained by the material structure; the\nbetter structures expose individual fibers to the flow while the poor materials\nmay have small fundamental fibers but these are in tightly bundled yarns. The\nfit and use of the whole mask are critical factors not addressed in this work.\nDespite the complexity of the design of a very good mask, it is clear that for\nthe larger aerosol particles, any mask will provide substantial protection to\nthe wearer and those around them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 16:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

It is possible at any time to\nswitch over from the different production rates but it is mandatory to\nswitch-off when the inventory process reaches the storage maximum capacity. We\nconsider holding, production, shortage penalty and switching costs. This model\nwas introduced by Doshi, Van Der Duyn Schouten and Talman in 1978. Our aim is\nto minimize the expected discounted cumulative costs up to infinity over all\nadmissible switching strategies. We show that the optimal cost functions for\nthe different production rates satisfy the corresponding\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman system of equations in a viscosity sense and prove a\nverification theorem. The way in which the optimal cost functions solve the\ndifferent variational inequalities gives the switching regions of the optimal\nstrategy, hence it is stationary in the sense that depends only on the current\nproduction rate and inventory level. We define the notion of finite band\nstrategies and derive, using scale functions, the formulas for the different\ncosts of the band strategies with one or two bands. We also show that there are\nexamples where the switching strategy presented by Doshi et al. is not the\noptimal strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 17:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-14"}

Offline meta-RL is analogous to the widely successful supervised\nlearning strategy of pre-training a model on a large batch of fixed,\npre-collected data (possibly from various tasks) and fine-tuning the model to a\nnew task with relatively little data. That is, in offline meta-RL, we\nmeta-train on fixed, pre-collected data from several tasks in order to adapt to\na new task with a very small amount (less than 5 trajectories) of data from the\nnew task. By nature of being offline, algorithms for offline meta-RL can\nutilize the largest possible pool of training data available and eliminate\npotentially unsafe or costly data collection during meta-training. This setting\ninherits the challenges of offline RL, but it differs significantly because\noffline RL does not generally consider a) transfer to new tasks or b) limited\ndata from the test task, both of which we face in offline meta-RL.

In particular, lung cancer is\namong the most common and deadliest cancers with a low 5-year survival rate.\nTimely diagnosis of lung cancer is, therefore, of paramount importance as it\ncan save countless lives. In this regard, deep learning radiomics solutions\nhave the promise of extracting the most useful features on their own in an\nend-to-end fashion without having access to the annotated boundaries.

Capitalizing on their\nsuccess, in this study, we propose a novel capsule network-based mixture of\nexperts, referred to as the MIXCAPS.

At the receiver, the\nfirst step of wideband spectrum digitization is accomplished using a novel\napproach of integrating sparse antenna-array with reconfigurable sub-Nyquist\nsampling (SNS). The reconfigurable SNS allows the digitization of\nnon-contiguous spectrum via low-rate analog-to-digital converters, but it needs\nintelligence to choose the frequency bands for digitization. We explore the\nmulti-play multi-armed bandit based learning algorithm to embed intelligence.\nCompared to previous works, the proposed characterization (frequency band\nstatus and direction-of-arrival estimation) approach does not need prior\nknowledge of received signal distribution. The detailed experimental results\nfor various spectrum statistics, power gains and antenna array arrangements\nalong with lower complexity validate the functional correctness, superiority\nand feasibility of the proposed UWAS over state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 19:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

This was the motivation to\nwrite on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and\ncharacterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of\nUS/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and\nexplain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as\nwell as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system\nand data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its\npopularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical\ntranslatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation,\nsignal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step\nguideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been\npresented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed.\nPhotoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging\ntechnique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic\nimaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US\nsystems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US\nimage reconstruction and processing.

Both\nlongitudinal and transverse DM vectors are considered. Using numerical DMRG, we\ncompute the one-tangle, two-spin concurrence and the Wigner-Yananse-skew\ninformation. We show that a longitudinal DMI destroys the factorizability\nproperty while a transverse DMI preserves it. We relate the absence of\nfactorizability to the breaking of the $U(1)$ rotation symmetry about the local\nmagnetization axis at each lattice site. Physically, breaking of the symmetry\nmanifests in the existence of a chiral current. Although the longitudinal DMI\ndestroys factorizability, we obtain a `pseudofactorizing' field ($h_{pf}$) at\nwhich entanglement and hence violation of the $U(1)$ symmetry is minimal. Our\ncalculations indicate a phase coherent ground state at $h_{pf}$. An\nentanglement transition (ET) occurs across this field which is characterized by\nan enhanced but finite range of two-spin concurrence in its vicinity in\ncontrast with the diverging range of the concurrence for the ET across the\nfactorizing field ($h_{f}$). We relate the asymmetry to the `frameness' or the\nability for the state to act as a reference frame for some measurement. In\nabsence of longitudinal DMI (or in presence of transverse DMI), at $h_{f}$, the\nsingle site magnetization axis specifies the common $z$-axis for the full\nsystem but not the full Cartesian reference frame due to a lack of phase\nreference. On the other hand, in the presence of a longitudinal DMI, our\nresults indicate that at $h_{pf}$, the local magnetization and the chiral\ncurrent are sufficient to specify the full Cartesian reference frame, with the\nchiral current being the macroscopic quantity to determine the phase reference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 20:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

A simple model for the time evolution\nof droplet/aerosol concentration is presented based on a theoretical analysis\nof the relevant physical processes. The modeling framework along with detailed\nexperiments and simulations can be used to study a wide variety of scenarios\ninvolving breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing and in a number of\nenvironmental conditions, as humid or dry atmosphere, confined or open\nenvironment. Although a number of questions remain open on the physics of\nevaporation and coupling with persistence of the virus, it is clear that with a\nmore reliable understanding of the underlying flow physics of virus\ntransmission one can set the foundation for an improved methodology in\ndesigning case-specific social distancing and infection control guidelines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 21:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

The Galerkin and least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (LSPG) methods are\ntested on compressible flows involving a disparity of temporal scales. A novel\ncalibration strategy is proposed for the LSPG method and two test cases are\nanalyzed. The first consists of a subsonic airfoil flow where boundary layer\ninstabilities are responsible for trailing-edge noise generation and the second\ncomprises a supersonic airfoil flow with a transient period where a detached\nshock wave propagates upstream at the same time that shock-vortex interaction\noccurs at the trailing edge. Results show that calibration produces stable and\nlong-time accurate for both cases. In order to reduce the computational costs\nof the LSPG models, an accelerated greedy missing point estimation (MPE)\nalgorithm is employed for hyper-reduction. For the first case investigated,\nLSPG solutions obtained with hyper-reduction show good comparison with those\nobtained by the full order model. However, for the supersonic case the\ntransient features of the flow need to be properly captured by the sampled\npoints. Otherwise, the dynamics of the moving shock wave are not fully\nrecovered. The impact of different time-marching schemes is also assessed and,\ndifferently than reported in literature, Galerkin models are shown to be more\naccurate than those computed by LSPG when the non-conservative form of the\nNavier-Stokes equations are solved. For the supersonic case, the Galerkin and\nLSPG models (without hyper-reduction) capture the overall dynamics of the\ndetached and oblique shock waves along the airfoil. However, when shock-vortex\ninteraction occurs at the trailing-edge, the Galerkin ROM is able to capture\nthe high-frequency fluctuations from vortex shedding while the LSPG presents a\nmore dissipative solution, not being able to recover the flow dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 21:40:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Therefore, the structure of an SNN\nshould depend on the dimensions of a problem space. The experimental results\nshow that the number of hidden neurons up to the dimension number of a problem\nspace is enough; the learnability of SNNs, produced by KPI-PDBP, is better than\nthat of SNNs, optimized by KPI-VPSO, regarding the performance and learning\ntime on the training data sets; the robustness of SNNs learned by KPI-PDBPs and\nKPI-VPSOs depends on the data sets; and comparing with other classic machine\nlearning models, ACC-PDBPs win for almost all tested data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 23:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-10"}

Recent\nresults have shown that using scale-dependent critical values for the scan\nstatistic allows to attain asymptotically optimal detection simultaneously for\nall signal lengths, thereby improving on the traditional scan, but this\nprocedure has been criticized for losing too much power for short signals. We\nexplain this discrepancy by showing that these asymptotic optimality results\nwill necessarily be too imprecise to discern the performance of scan statistics\nin a practically relevant way, even in a large sample context. Instead, we\npropose to assess the performance with a new finite sample criterion. We then\npresent three calibrations for scan statistics that perform well across a range\nof relevant signal lengths: The first calibration uses a particular adjustment\nto the critical values and is therefore tailored to the Gaussian case. The\nsecond calibration uses a scale-dependent adjustment to the significance levels\nand is therefore applicable to arbitrary known null distributions. The third\ncalibration restricts the scan to a particular sparse subset of the scan\nwindows and then applies a weighted Bonferroni adjustment to the corresponding\ntest statistics. This {\\sl Bonferroni scan} is also applicable to arbitrary\nnull distributions and in addition is very simple to implement.

As such, characterizing the\nperformance of mixed aerial-terrestrial networks with accurate fading models is\ncritical to precise network performance characterization and resource\noptimization. We first characterize closed-form expressions for a variety of\nperformance metrics such as frame decoding error probability (referred to as\nreliability), outage probability, and ergodic capacity of users. The\nterrestrial and aerial transmissions may experience either LoS Rician fading or\nNLoS Nakagami-m fading with a certain probability.

Complexity analysis of the proposed algorithms is\npresented. Numerical results verify the accuracy of our derived expressions and\nreveal the significance of aerial relays compared to ground relays in\nincreasing the throughput of D2D pairs especially for distant D2D pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 23:50:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

In this theoretical work, we consider central\nswelling and shrinkage of plates of aspect ratio and material properties\nrelevant to the manufacture of engineered wood composite panels in which both\nin-plane swelling and material stiffness are highly orthotropic, leading to\nmultiple separations in energy scales. With transverse swelling in the soft\ndirection, and gradients in the stiff direction, the warped plates adopt two\ndistinct types of configurations, axisymmetric and twisted, which we illustrate\nwith toy models. We employ a two-parameter family of isometries to embed the\nmetric programmed by the swelling, thus reducing the problem to one of\nminimizing bending energy alone. A simple argument is seen to closely predict\naveraged axisymmetric curvatures. While purely cylindrical shapes are\nunobtainable by pure in-plane swelling, they can be closely approximated in a\nhighly anisotropic system. However, anisotropy can favor twisting, and breaks a\ndegenerate soft deformation mode associated with minimal surfaces in isotropic\nmaterials. Bifurcations from axisymmetric to twisted shapes can be induced by\nanisotropy or by certain attributes of a central shrinkage profile.

Our main objective is to investigate the critical particle\nnumber below which, during a gravitational collapse, the amplification of\ntriaxiality from initial fluctuations is effective, and above which it is\nineffective. To this aim, we develop the Lin-Mestel-Shu theory for a system of\nparticles initially with isotropic velocity dispersion and with a simple\npower-law density profile. We first determine, for an unstable cloud, two radii\ncorresponding to the balance of two opposing forces and their fluctuations:\nsuch radii fix the sizes of the non-collapsing region and the triaxial seed\nfrom density fluctuations. We hypothesize that the triaxial degree of the final\nstate depends on which radius is dominant prior to the collapse phase leading\nto a different scheme of the self-consistent shape evolution of the core and\nthe rest of the system. The condition where the two radii are equal therefore\nidentifies the critical particle number, which can be expressed as the function\nof the parameters of initial state. In numerical work, we can pinpoint such a\ncritical number by comparing the virialized flattening with the initial\nflattening. The difference between these two quantities agrees with the\ntheoretical predictions only for the power-law density profiles with an\nexponent in the range $[0,0.25]$. For higher exponents, results suggest that\nthe critical number is above the range of simulated $N$. We speculate that\nthere is an additional mechanism, related to strong density gradients that\nincreases further the flattening, requiring higher $N$ to further weaken the\ninitial fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 05:23:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Although density functional theory\ncalculations have shown that the inclusion of Mg interstitial atoms is\nenergetically most favorable in majority of LPSO alloys, solute elements have\nalso been experimentally observed at interstitial sites. To predict the\ndistributions of interstitial atoms in the cluster and to determine the kind of\nelements present, it is necessary to identify mechanisms by which interstitial\natoms are created. In the present work, we use density functional theory\ncalculations to investigate growth processes of solute clusters, specifically\nthe Mg-Y-Zn LPSO alloy, in order to determine the precise atomistic structure\nof its solute clusters.

We also demonstrate that interstitial atoms are mostly Mg,\nwhile the rest are Y; interstitial Zn atoms are negligible.

Various novel\nintersection control methods have been proposed in the existing literature, and\nthey can be roughly divided into two categories: vehicle-based traffic control\nand phase-based traffic control. Phase-based traffic control can be treated as\nupdated versions of the current intersection signal control with the\nincorporation of the performance of autonomous vehicle functions. Meanwhile,\nvehicle-based traffic control utilizes some brand-new methods, mostly in\nreal-time fashion, to organize traffic at intersections for safe and efficient\nvehicle passages. However, to date, no systematic comparison between these two\ncontrol categories has been performed to suggest their advantages and\ndisadvantages. This paper conducts a series of numerical simulations under\nvarious traffic scenarios to perform a fair comparison of their performances.\nSpecifically, we allow trajectory adjustments of incoming vehicles under\nphasebased traffic control, while for its vehicle-based counterpart, we\nimplement two strategies, i.e., the first-come-first-serve strategy and the\nconflict-point based rolling-horizon optimization strategy. Overall, the\nsimulation results show that vehicle-based traffic control generally incurs a\nnegligible delay when traffic demand is low but lead to an excessive queuing\ntime as the traffic volume becomes high. However, performance of vehicle-based\ntraffic control may benefit from reduction in conflicting vehicle pairs. We\nalso discovered that when autonomous driving technologies are not mature, the\nadvantages of phase-based traffic control are much more distinct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 09:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

Verifying screw\nplacement on high-quality tomographic imaging is essential. C-arm Cone-beam CT\n(CBCT) provides intraoperative 3D tomographic imaging which would allow for\nimmediate verification and, if needed, revision. However, the reconstruction\nquality attainable with commercial CBCT devices is insufficient, predominantly\ndue to severe metal artifacts in the presence of pedicle screws. These\nartifacts arise from a mismatch between the true physics of image formation and\nan idealized model thereof assumed during reconstruction. Prospectively\nacquiring views onto anatomy that are least affected by this mismatch can,\ntherefore, improve reconstruction quality. We propose to adjust the C-arm CBCT\nsource trajectory during the scan to optimize reconstruction quality with\nrespect to a certain task, i.e. verification of screw placement. Adjustments\nare performed on-the-fly using a convolutional neural network that regresses a\nquality index for possible next views given the current x-ray image. Adjusting\nthe CBCT trajectory to acquire the recommended views results in non-circular\nsource orbits that avoid poor images, and thus, data inconsistencies. We\ndemonstrate that convolutional neural networks trained on realistically\nsimulated data are capable of predicting quality metrics that enable\nscene-specific adjustments of the CBCT source trajectory. Using both\nrealistically simulated data and real CBCT acquisitions of a\nsemi-anthropomorphic phantom, we show that tomographic reconstructions of the\nresulting scene-specific CBCT acquisitions exhibit improved image quality\nparticularly in terms of metal artifacts. Since the optimization objective is\nimplicitly encoded in a neural network, the proposed approach overcomes the\nneed for 3D information at run-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 09:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

Such models may provide sub-optimal or\neven infeasible designs and dispatch schedules. In DES, optimal power flow\n(OPF) is often misrepresented and treated as a standalone problem. OPF consists\nof highly nonlinear and nonconvex constraints related to the underlying\nalternating current (AC) distribution network. This aspect of the optimisation\nproblem has often been overlooked by researchers in the process systems and\noptimisation area. In this review we address the disparity between OPF and DES\nmodels, highlighting the importance of including elements of OPF in DES design\nand operational models to ensure that the design and operation of microgrids\nmeet the requirements of the electrical grid. By analysing foundational models\nfor both DES and OPF, we identify detailed technical power flow constraints\nthat have been typically represented using oversimplified linear approximations\nin DES models. We also identify a subset of models, labelled DES-OPF, which\ninclude these detailed constraints and use innovative optimisation approaches\nto solve them. Results of these studies suggest that achieving feasible\nsolutions with high-fidelity models is more important than achieving globally\noptimal solutions using less-detailed DES models. Recommendations for future\nwork include the need for more comparisons between high-fidelity models and\nmodels with linear approximations, and the use of simulation tools to validate\nDES-OPF models. The review is aimed at a multidisciplinary audience of\nresearchers and stakeholders who are interested in modelling DES to support the\ndevelopment of more robust and accurate optimisation models for the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 10:12:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 17:11:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

The light curves are characterised by non-coherent\nperiods dominated by the fundamental and first harmonic with variable relative\namplitudes. By comparing the equatorial rotational velocities obtained from the\nphotometric fundamental periods with the projected rotational velocities,it is\nshown that the fundamental period is indistinguishable from the rotation\nperiod. The distributions of the projected rotational velocities and the\nequatorial rotational velocities for Be and non-Be stars are discussed. Using\nthe equatorial rotational velocities of Be stars directly determined from the\nphotometric period, it is found that, on average, Be stars rotate at about 0.66\nof critical velocity. This result is independent of assumptions concerning\ngravity darkening. It is shown that the rotational amplitudes of Be stars\nincrease with effective temperature and are considerably higher than those of\nnon-Be stars. The amplitude distributions of Be and non-Be stars are also\nsignificantly different. Of particular interest is a large rise in rotational\namplitudes from A0 to B5 for non-Be stars.

The\ntermination problem is one of the most fundamental liveness properties for such\nprograms. The qualitative (aka almost-sure) termination problem asks whether a\ngiven program terminates with probability 1. Ranking functions provide a sound\nand complete approach for termination of non-probabilistic programs, and their\nextension to probabilistic programs is achieved via ranking supermartingales\n(RSMs). RSMs have been extended to lexicographic RSMs to handle programs with\ninvolved control-flow structure, as well as for compositional approach. There\nare two key limitations of the existing RSM-based approaches: First, the\nlexicographic RSM-based approach requires a strong nonnegativity assumption,\nwhich need not always be satisfied. The second key limitation of the existing\nRSM-based algorithmic approaches is that they rely on pre-computed invariants.\nThe main drawback of relying on pre-computed invariants is the\ninsufficiency-inefficiency trade-off: weak invariants might be insufficient for\nRSMs to prove termination, while using strong invariants leads to inefficiency\nin computing them. Our contributions are twofold: First, we show how to relax\nthe strong nonnegativity condition and still provide soundness guarantee for\nalmost-sure termination. Second, we present an incremental approach where the\nprocess of computing lexicographic RSMs proceeds by iterative pruning of parts\nof the program that were already shown to be terminating, in cooperation with a\nsafety prover.

These costs allow to\nincorporate disfavored aspects of features, e.g. failure rates of as measuring\ndevice, or patient harm, in the model selection process. Random Forests define\na particularly challenging problem for feature selection, as features are\ngenerally entangled in an ensemble of multiple trees, which makes a post hoc\nremoval of features infeasible. Feature selection methods therefore often\neither focus on simple pre-filtering methods, or require many Random Forest\nevaluations along their optimization path, which drastically increases the\ncomputational complexity. To solve both issues, we propose Shallow Tree\nSelection, a novel fast and multivariate feature selection method that selects\nfeatures from small tree structures. Additionally, we also adapt three standard\nfeature selection algorithms for cost-sensitive learning by introducing a\nhyperparameter-controlled benefit-cost ratio criterion (BCR) for each method.\nIn an extensive simulation study, we assess this criterion, and compare the\nproposed methods to multiple performance-based baseline alternatives on four\nartificial data settings and seven real-world data settings.

This is realized by introducing a phase-dependent phonon-exchange\ninteraction, which is used to form a loop-coupled configuration. Combining this\nphase-dependent coupling with the optomechanical interactions, the dark-mode\neffect can be controlled by the quantum interference effect. In particular, the\ndark-mode effect in this two-mechanical-mode optomechanical system can lead to\na double-amplified optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) window and a\nhigher efficiency of the second-order sideband in comparison with the standard\noptomechanical system. This is because the effective mechanical decay rate\nrelated to the linewidth of the OMIT window becomes a twofold increase in the\nweak-coupling limit. When the dark-mode effect is broken, controllable double\ntransparency windows appear and the second-order sideband, as well as the light\ndelay or advance, is significantly enhanced. For an N-mechanical-mode\noptomechanical system, we find that in the presence of the dark-mode effect,\nthe amplification multiple of the linewidth of the OMIT window is nearly\nproportional to the number of mechanical modes, and that the OMIT with a single\nwindow becomes the one with N tunable windows by breaking the dark-mode effect.\nThe study will be useful in optical information storage within a\nlarge-frequency bandwidth and multichannel optical communication based on\noptomechanical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 12:22:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

With this motivation in mind,\nthe new paradigm described here is data-driven and, to a large extent, we avoid\nmodelling difficulties by concentrating on just two key quantities which are\ncommon to pandemics: the doubling time, denoted by $d(k)$ and the peak day\ndenoted by $\\theta(k)$. Our numerical studies to date suggest that our\nappealingly simple model can provide a reasonable fit to real data. Given that\ntime is of the essence during the ongoing global health crisis, the intent of\nthis paper is to introduce this new paradigm to control practitioners and\ndescribe a number of new research directions suggested by our current results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 12:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

The time series of gait parameters are long-range\ncorrelated (statistical persistence). In contrast, when gait is synchronized\nwith external rhythmic cues, the fluctuation regime is modified to stochastic\noscillations around the target frequency (statistical anti-persistence). To\nhighlight these two fluctuation modes, the prevalent methodology is the\ndetrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). The DFA outcome is the scaling exponent,\nwhich lies between 0.5 and 1 if the time series exhibit long-range\ncorrelations, and below 0.5 if the time series is anti-correlated. A\nfundamental assumption for applying DFA is that the analyzed time series\nresults from a time-invariant generating process. However, a gait time series\nmay be constituted by an ensemble of sub-segments with distinct fluctuation\nregimes (e.g., correlated and anti-correlated). Methods: Several proportions of\ncorrelated and anti-correlated time series were mixed together and then\nanalyzed through DFA. The original (before mixing) time series were generated\nvia autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) modelling or\nactual gait data. Results: Results evidenced a nonlinear sensitivity of DFA to\nthe mix of correlated and anti-correlated series. Notably, adding a small\nproportion of correlated segments into an anti-correlated time series had\nstronger effects than the reverse. Significance: In case of changes in gait\ncontrol during a walking trial, the resulting time series may be a patchy\nensemble of several fluctuation regimes. When applying DFA, the scaling\nexponent may be misinterpreted. Cued walking studies may be most at risk of\nsuffering this issue in cases of sporadic synchronization with external cues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 13:36:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

Current research in neuromorphic hardware targets\ndramatic improvements to ANN performance by increasing energy efficiency, speed\nof operation, and even seeks to extend the utility of ANNs by natively adding\nfunctionality such as spiking operation. One promising neuromorphic hardware\nplatform is based on superconductive electronics, which has the potential to\nincorporate all of these advantages at the device level in addition to offering\nthe potential of near lossless communications both within the neuromorphic\ncircuits as well as between disparate superconductive chips. Here we explore\none of the fundamental brain-inspired architecture components, the fan-in and\nfan-out as realized in superconductive circuits based on Josephson junctions.\nFrom our calculations and WRSPICE simulations we find that the fan-out should\nbe limited only by junction count and circuit size limitations, and we\ndemonstrate results in simulation at a level of 1-to-10,000, similar to that of\nthe human brain. We find that fan-in has more limitations, but a fan-in level\non the order of a few 100-to-1 should be achievable based on current\ntechnology.

The research activity at LSC is about Astroparticle\nPhysics, dark matter searches and neutrino Physics; but also activities in\nNuclear Astrophysics, Geophysics, and Biology are carried out. The\ninvestigation of the neutrinoless double beta decay has been one of the main\nresearch lines of LSC since the beginning. Many unknowns remain in the\ncharacterization of the basic neutrino properties and the study of this rare\ndecay process requiring Physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics\ncan shed light on the lepton number conservation, the nature of the neutrinos\nas Dirac or Majorana particles and the absolute scale and ordering of the\nmasses of the three generations. Here, the double beta decay searches performed\nat LSC for different emitters and following very different experimental\napproaches will be reviewed: from the very first experiments in the laboratory\nincluding the successful IGEX for $^{76}$Ge, which released very stringent\nlimits to the effective neutrino mass at the time, to the present NEXT\nexperiment for $^{136}$Xe and future project CROSS (\"Cryogenic Rare-event\nObservatory with Surface Sensitivity\") for $^{130}$Te and $^{100}$Mo, both\nimplementing innovative detector technologies to discriminate backgrounds. For\nthe neutrinoless double beta decay channel and at 90% C.L., IGEX derived a\nlimit to the half-life of $^{76}$Ge of $T_{1/2}^{0\\nu} > 1.57 \\times 10^{25}$ y\nwhile the corresponding expected limits are $T_{1/2}^{0\\nu} > 1.0\\times\n10^{26}$ y for $^{136}$Xe from NEXT-100 (for an exposure of 500 kg.y) and\n$T_{1/2}^{0\\nu} > 2.8 \\times 10^{25}$ y for $^{100}$Mo from CROSS (for 5 y and\n4.7 kg of isotope). Activities related to double beta decays searches carried\nout in other underground laboratories have also been developed at LSC and will\nbe presented too, like the operation of the BiPo-3 detector for radiopurity\nmeasurements of thin sheets with very high sensitivity. For each one of these\nexperiments, the concept, the experimental set-ups and relevant results will be\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 15:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

A station-based bike sharing system\nis usually operated in the way that a user picks up a bike from one station,\nand drops it off at another. Bike stations are, however, not static, as the\nbike stations are often reconfigured to accommodate changing demands or city\nurbanization over time. One of the key operations is to evaluate candidate\nlocations and install new stations to expand the bike sharing station network.\nConventional practices have been studied to predict existing station usage,\nwhile evaluating new stations is highly challenging due to the lack of the\nhistorical bike usage.\n  To fill this gap, in this work we propose a novel and efficient bike\nstation-level prediction algorithm called AtCoR, which can predict the bike\nusage at both existing and new stations (candidate locations during\nreconfiguration). In order to address the lack of historical data issues,\nvirtual historical usage of new stations is generated according to their\ncorrelations with the surrounding existing stations, for AtCoR model\ninitialization. We have designed novel station-centered heatmaps which\ncharacterize for each target station centered at the heatmap the trend that\nriders travel between it and the station's neighboring regions, enabling the\nmodel to capture the learnable features of the bike station network. The\ncaptured features are further applied to the prediction of bike usage for new\nstations. Our extensive experiment study on more than 23 million trips from\nthree major bike sharing systems in US, including New York City, Chicago and\nLos Angeles, shows that AtCoR outperforms baselines and state-of-art models in\nprediction of both existing and future stations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 23:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

In this paper, we propose to adopt exploration for\nmultichannel ALOHA by transmitting preambles before transmitting data packets\nin MTC, and show that the maximum throughput can be improved by a factor of 2 -\nexp(-1) = 1.632, In the proposed approach, a base station (BS) needs to send\nthe feedback information to active users to inform the numbers of transmitted\npreambles in multiple channels, which can be reliably estimated as in\ncompressive random access. A steady-state analysis is also performed with fast\nretrial, which shows that the probability of packet collision becomes lower\nand, as a result, the delay outage probability is greatly reduced for a lightly\nloaded system.

In binarised regression, binary decisions are\ngenerated from a learned regression model (or real-valued dependent variable),\nwhich is useful when the division between instances that should be predicted\npositive or negative depends on the utility. For example, in mining, the\nboundary between a valuable rock and a waste rock depends on the market price\nof various metals, which varies with time. This paper proposes impact curves to\nevaluate binarised regression with instance-varying costs, where some instances\nare much worse to be classified as positive (or negative) than other instances;\ne.g., it is much worse to throw away a high-grade gold rock than a medium-grade\ncopper-ore rock, even if the mine wishes to keep both because both are\nprofitable. We show how to construct an impact curve for a variety of domains,\nincluding examples from healthcare, mining, and entertainment. Impact curves\noptimize binary decisions across all utilities of the chosen utility function,\nidentify the conditions where one model may be favoured over another, and\nquantitatively assess improvement between competing models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 04:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

The adequate sample size was defined as\nthe sample size for which the performance of a model equalled the maximum model\nperformance minus a small threshold value.\n  Results: The adequate sample size achieves a median reduction of the number\nof observations between 9.5% and 78.5% for threshold values between 0.001 and\n0.02.
