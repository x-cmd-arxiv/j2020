It was originally designed for systems consisting of static\nsensor or Internet of Things (IoT) devices and static gateways. It was recently\nupdated to introduce new features such as nano-second timestamps which open up\napplications to enable LoRaWAN to be adopted for mobile device tracking and\nlocalisation. In such mobile scenarios, devices could temporarily lose\ncommunication with the gateways because of interference from obstacles or deep\nfading, causing throughput reduction and delays in data transmission. To\novercome this problem, we propose a new data forwarding scheme. Instead of\nholding the data until the next contact with gateways, devices can forward\ntheir data to nearby devices that have a higher probability of being in contact\nwith gateways. We propose a new network metric called Real-Time Contact-Aware\nExpected Transmission Count (RCA-ETX) to model this contact probability in\nreal-time. Without making any assumption on mobility models, this metric\nexploits data transmission delays to model complex device mobility. We also\nextend RCA-ETX with a throughput-optimal stochastic backpressure routing scheme\nand propose Real-Time Opportunistic Backpressure Collection (ROBC), a protocol\nto counter the stochastic behaviours resulting from the dynamics associated\nwith mobility. To apply our approaches seamlessly to LoRaWAN-enabled devices,\nwe further propose two new LaRaWAN classes, namely Modified Class-C and\nQueue-based Class-A. Both of them are compatible with LoRaWAN Class-A devices.\nOur data-driven experiments, based on the London bus network, show that our\napproaches can reduce data transmission delays up to $25\\%$ and provide a\n$53\\%$ throughput improvement in data transfer performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 16:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

However, there has been little investigation\non accurate descriptions of the sampling distributions of network moment\nstatistics. In this paper, we present the first higher-order accurate\napproximation to the sampling CDF of a studentized network moment by Edgeworth\nexpansion. In sharp contrast to classical literature on noiseless U-statistics,\nwe show that the Edgeworth expansion of a network moment statistic as a noisy\nU-statistic can achieve higher-order accuracy without non-lattice or smoothness\nassumptions but just requiring weak regularity conditions. Behind this result\nis our surprising discovery that the two typically-hated factors in network\nanalysis, namely, sparsity and edge-wise observational errors, jointly play a\nblessing role, contributing a crucial self-smoothing effect in the network\nmoment statistic and making it analytically tractable. Our assumptions match\nthe minimum requirements in related literature. For sparse networks, our theory\nshows a simple normal approximation achieves a gradually depreciating\nBerry-Esseen bound as the network becomes sparser. This result also refines the\nbest previous theoretical result.\n  For practitioners, our empirical Edgeworth expansion is highly accurate, fast\nand easy to implement.

The incentives entailed daily monetary\nvalues between $5 and $50 administered in a randomized order and the visual\nfeedback consisted of a web-based dashboard aimed at increasing the energy\nawareness of participants. Experiments were performed in government office and\nuniversity buildings at NASA Ames Research Park located in Moffett Field, CA.\nAutoregressive models were constructed to predict expected plugload savings in\nthe presence of exogenous variables. Analysis of the data revealed modulation\nof plugload energy consumption can be achieved via visual feedback and\nincentive mechanisms suggesting that occupant-in-the-loop control architectures\nmay be effective in the commercial building environment. Our findings indicate\nthat the mean energy reduction due to visual feedback in office and university\nenvironments were ~9.52% and ~21.61%, respectively. By augmenting the visual\nfeedback in the university environment with a monetary incentive, the mean\nenergy reduction was found to be ~24.22%\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 16:23:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 21:57:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 02:07:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 15:01:50 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2022 00:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

One main challenge in TSC is the diversity\nof domains where time series data come from. Thus, there is no \"one model that\nfits all\" in TSC. Some algorithms are very accurate in classifying a specific\ntype of time series when the whole series is considered, while some only target\nthe existence/non-existence of specific patterns/shapelets. Yet other\ntechniques focus on the frequency of occurrences of discriminating\npatterns/features. This paper presents a new classification technique that\naddresses the inherent diversity problem in TSC using a nature-inspired method.\nThe technique is stimulated by how flies look at the world through \"compound\neyes\" that are made up of thousands of lenses, called ommatidia. Each\nommatidium is an eye with its own lens, and thousands of them together create a\nbroad field of vision. The developed technique similarly uses different lenses\nand representations to look at the time series, and then combines them for\nbroader visibility. These lenses have been created through\nhyper-parameterisation of symbolic representations (Piecewise Aggregate and\nFourier approximations). The algorithm builds a random forest for each lens,\nthen performs soft dynamic voting for classifying new instances using the most\nconfident eyes, i.e, forests. We evaluate the new technique, coined Co-eye,\nusing the recently released extended version of UCR archive, containing more\nthan 100 datasets across a wide range of domains. The results show the benefits\nof bringing together different perspectives reflecting on the accuracy and\nrobustness of Co-eye in comparison to other state-of-the-art techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 17:16:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 10:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-16"}

The\ndifference between the properties of positive and negative streamers is\nassociated with the different directions of the electron drift ahead of the\nstreamer head. As a result, the peak electric field at the streamer head and\nthe streamer velocity are higher for positive voltage polarity. The average\nelectric field in the negative streamer channel is approximately twice that in\nthe positive streamer channel, in agreement with available measurements in long\nair gaps. It is shown that photoionization in front of the streamer head is\nimportant not only for the development of strong positive discharges, but for\nthe development of strong negative discharges as well.

In this limit, heat transport is mostly supplied by\nquasi-particles with a very large mean free path $\\ell$. Upon increasing the\nsystem size $L$, three different regimes can be observed: a ballistic one, an\nintermediate diffusive range, and, eventually, the crossover to the anomalous\n(hydrodynamic) regime. Our theoretical considerations are supported by\nnumerical simulations of a gas of diatomic hard-point particles for almost\nequal masses and of a weakly perturbed Toda chain. Finally, we discuss the case\nof the perturbed harmonic chain, which exhibits a yet different scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 17:28:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 14:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

A statistical test suggests\nthat the probability that this detection is due to random fluctuation of noise\nis < 1% but this result depends on the assumption that distribution of noise is\nuniform over the image.

We quantify convergence with respect to a mock observation of box length\n1.1 Gpc, with thermal noise computed for a 1000h observation with SKA1-low. We\nfind that simulations of box lengths 200-300 Mpc underestimate the large-scale\npower during the CD by ~7-9 % on average. We conclude that box lengths of\n$L\\gtrsim250$ Mpc are needed to converge at the level of <~1$\\sigma$ of the\ntotal noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 17:58:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 17:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

Network embedding is a\nmethodology to assign coordinates to nodes in a low dimensional vector space.\nBy embedding nodes into vectors, the link prediction problem can be converted\ninto a similarity comparison task. Nodes with similar embedding vectors are\nmore likely to be connected. Classic network embedding algorithms are\nrandom-walk-based.

The node pair set is further used as the\ninput for a Skip-Gram model, a representative language model that embeds nodes\n(which are regarded as words) into vectors. In the present study, we propose to\nreplace random walk processes by a spreading process, namely the\nsusceptible-infected (SI) model, to sample paths. Specifically, we propose two\nSI-spreading-based algorithms, SINE and TSINE, to embed static and temporal\nnetworks, respectively.

The better performance of SINE and TSINE requires a\nsmaller sampling size in comparison with the baseline algorithms.

By conducting experiments on real-world traces\nand networks, we identify the interplay between content popularity skewness and\nrequest stream correlation as an important factor affecting cache performance.\nWith respect to routing, we show that the main factors impacting performance\nare alternate path routing and content search. We then discuss the\napplicability of multiple machine learning models, specifically reinforcement\nlearning, deep learning, transfer learning and probabilistic graphical models\nfor the caching and routing problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 20:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-16"}

Such a powerful topological prior prevents\nsolutions from excessive shrinking by enforcing any horizontal or vertical line\nwithin the bounding box to contain, at least, one pixel of the foreground\nregion. Furthermore, we integrate our deep tightness prior with a global\nbackground emptiness constraint, guiding training with information outside the\nbounding box. We demonstrate experimentally that such a global constraint is\nmuch more powerful than standard cross-entropy for the background class. Our\noptimization problem is challenging as it takes the form of a large set of\ninequality constraints on the outputs of deep networks.

This approach is\nsub-optimal. In this dissertation we investigate a recently proposed quantum\nalgorithm for this task, which is inspired by classical belief-propagation\nalgorithms, and analyze its performance on a simple $5$-bit code. We show that\nthe algorithm is optimal for each bit and it appears to achieve optimal\nperformance when deciding the full transmitted message.

Unfortunately, it is not trivial to fully describe our\npriors in a convenient and analytical way. Parameterizing the unknowns with a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN), and assuming an uninformative Gaussian\nprior on its weights, leads to a variational prior on the output space that\nfavors \"natural\" images and excludes noisy artifacts, as long as overfitting is\nprevented. This is the so-called deep-prior approach. In seismic imaging,\nhowever, evaluating the forward operator is computationally expensive, and\ntraining a randomly initialized CNN becomes infeasible. We propose, instead, a\nweak version of deep priors, which consists of relaxing the requirement that\nreflectivity models must lie in the network range, and letting the unknowns\ndeviate from the network output according to a Gaussian distribution. Finally,\nwe jointly solve for the reflectivity model and CNN weights. The chief\nadvantage of this approach is that the updates for the CNN weights do not\ninvolve the modeling operator, and become relatively cheap. Our synthetic\nnumerical experiments demonstrate that the weak deep prior is more robust with\nrespect to noise than conventional least-squares imaging approaches, with\nroughly twice the computational cost of reverse-time migration, which is the\naffordable computational budget in large-scale imaging problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 23:39:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 16:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

Steady detonation waves were\nobtained at the macro-scale, with the near-limit reaction zone structures\ncharacterized by significant unreacted gas pockets.

The results showed that the degree of\ndeparture between experiments and the theoretical predictions increases\nsignificantly with the detonation instability level. As compared to the laminar\nZND wave, the more unstable detonations are much more detonable than the more\nstable detonations, with substantially larger limiting divergence rates and\nmaximum velocity deficits. Such enhanced detonability with detonation\ninstability can be manifested in the significantly enhanced global rates of\nenergy release with the notably suppressed thermal character of ignition for\nthe more unstable detonations.

Analysis of such\nmodels often focusses on relatively simple geometries and deals with diffusion\nthrough highly idealised homogeneous media. In contrast, practical applications\nof diffusive transport theory inevitably involve dealing with more complicated\ngeometries as well as dealing with heterogeneous media. One of the most\nfundamental properties of diffusive transport is the concept of mean particle\nlifetime or mean exit time, which are particular applications of the concept of\nfirst passage time, and provide the mean time required for a diffusing particle\nto reach an absorbing boundary. Most formal analysis of mean particle lifetime\napplies to relatively simple geometries, often with homogeneous\n(spatially-invariant) material properties. In this work, we present a general\nframework that provides exact mathematical insight into the mean particle\nlifetime, and higher moments of particle lifetime, for point particles\ndiffusing in heterogeneous discs and spheres with radial symmetry. Our analysis\napplies to geometries with an arbitrary number and arrangement of distinct\nlayers, where transport in each layer is characterised by a distinct\ndiffusivity.

The model selection is formulated\nas a contextual bandit problem characterized by a single-step Markov decision\nprocess, and is solved using a reinforcement learning policy network. We build\nan HEC testbed, implement our proposed approach, and evaluate it using real IoT\ndatasets. The demo shows that our proposed approach significantly reduces\ndetection delay (e.g., by 71.4% for univariate dataset) without sacrificing\naccuracy, as compared to offloading detection tasks to the cloud. We also\ncompare it with other baseline schemes and demonstrate that it achieves the\nbest accuracy-delay tradeoff.

We recast the RG as a\ndiscrete flow of the Hamiltonian tensor network, i.e., the collection of\nvarious $2n$-point scattering vertex tensors comprising the Hamiltonian. The\nrenormalisation progresses via unitary transformations that block diagonalizes\nthe Hamiltonian iteratively via the disentanglement of single-particle\neigenstates. This procedure incorporates naturally the role of quantum\nfluctuations. The RG flow equations possess a non-trivial structure, displaying\na feedback mechanism through frequency-dependent dynamical self-energies and\ncorrelation energies. The interplay between various UV energy scales enables\nthe coupled RG equations to flow towards a stable fixed point in the IR. The\neffective Hamiltonian at the IR fixed point generically has a reduced parameter\nspace, as well as number of degrees of freedom, compared to the microscopic\nHamiltonian. Importantly, the vertex tensor network is observed to govern the\nRG flow of the tensor network that denotes the coefficients of the\nmany-particle eigenstates. The RG evolution of various many-particle\nentanglement features of the eigenbasis are, in turn, quantified through the\ncoefficient tensor network. In this way, we show that the URG framework\nprovides a microscopic understanding of holographic renormalisation: the RG\nflow of the vertex tensor network generates a eigenstate coefficient tensor\nnetwork possessing a many-particle entanglement metric.

A recent observational census of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) has\nunveiled anomalous orbital structures. This has led to the hypothesis that an\nadditional $\\sim5-10~m_{\\oplus}$ planet exists. This planet, known as Planet 9,\noccupies an eccentric and inclined orbit at hundreds of astronomical units.\nHowever, the KBOs under consideration have the largest known semimajor axes at\n$a>250$ AU; thus they are very difficult to detect.//\n  Aims. In the context of the proposed Planet 9, we aim to measure the mean\nplane of the Kuiper belt at $a>50$ AU. In a comparison of the expected and\nobserved mean planes, some constraints would be put on the mass and orbit of\nthis undiscovered planet.\n  Methods. We adopted and developed the theoretical approach of Volk & Malhotra\n(2017) to the relative angle $\\delta$ between the expected mean plane of the\nKuiper belt and the invariable plane determined by the eight known planets.\nNumerical simulations were constructed to validate our theoretical approach.\nThen similar to Volk & Malhotra (2017), we derived the angle $\\delta$ for the\nreal observed KBOs with $100<a<200$ AU, and the measurement uncertainties were\nalso estimated. Finally, for comparison, maps of the theoretically expected\n$\\delta$ were created for different combinations of possible Planet 9\nparameters.\n  Results. The expected mean plane of the Kuiper belt nearly coincides with the\nsaid invariable plane interior to $a=90$ AU. But these two planes deviate\nnoticeably from each other at $a>100$ AU owing to the presence of Planet 9\nbecause the relative angle $\\delta$ could be as large as $\\sim10^{\\circ}$.\nUsing the $1\\sigma$ upper limit of $\\delta<5^{\\circ}$ deduced from real KBO\nsamples as a constraint, we present the most probable parameters of Planet 9.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 07:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

In all other\ncases a quantum-consistent special K\\\"ahler geometry is either an arithmetic\nquotient of the complex hyperbolic space $SU(1,m)/U(m)$ or has no \\emph{local}\nKilling vector.\n  Applied to Calabi-Yau 3-folds this result implies (assuming mirror symmetry)\nthe validity of the Oguiso-Sakurai conjecture in Algebraic Geometry: all\nCalabi-Yau 3-folds $X$ without rational curves have Picard number $\\rho=2,3$;\nin facts they are finite quotients of Abelian varieties. More generally: the\nK\\\"ahler moduli of $X$ do not receive quantum corrections if and only if $X$\nhas infinite fundamental group. In all other cases the K\\\"ahler moduli have\ninstanton corrections in (essentially) all possible degrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 07:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

When they are deployed on the client-side, ML-based\nclassifiers are vulnerable to evasion attacks. However, such potential threats\nhave received relatively little attention because existing attacks destruct the\nfunctionalities or appearance of webpages and are conducted in the white-box\nscenario, making it less practical. Consequently, it becomes imperative to\nunderstand whether it is possible to launch evasion attacks with limited\nknowledge of the classifier, while preserving the functionalities and\nappearance.\n  In this work, we show that even in the grey-, and black-box scenarios,\nevasion attacks are not only effective on practical ML-based classifiers, but\ncan also be efficiently launched without destructing the functionalities and\nappearance. For this purpose, we propose three mutation-based attacks,\ndiffering in the knowledge of the target classifier, addressing a key technical\nchallenge: automatically crafting an adversarial sample from a known phishing\nwebsite in a way that can mislead classifiers. To launch attacks in the white-\nand grey-box scenarios, we also propose a sample-based collision attack to gain\nthe knowledge of the target classifier. We demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of our evasion attacks on the state-of-the-art, Google's phishing\npage filter, achieved 100% attack success rate in less than one second per\nwebsite. Moreover, the transferability attack on BitDefender's industrial\nphishing page classifier, TrafficLight, achieved up to 81.25% attack success\nrate. We further propose a similarity-based method to mitigate such evasion\nattacks, Pelican. We demonstrate that Pelican can effectively detect evasion\nattacks.

Accordingly, there are numerous effective, but poorly understood,\ntechniques for tuning the learning rate, including learning rate decay, which\nstarts with a large initial learning rate that is gradually decreased. In this\npaper, we present a general theoretical analysis of the effect of the learning\nrate in stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Our analysis is based on the use of\na learning-rate-dependent stochastic differential equation (lr-dependent SDE)\nthat serves as a surrogate for SGD. For a broad class of objective functions,\nwe establish a linear rate of convergence for this continuous-time formulation\nof SGD, highlighting the fundamental importance of the learning rate in SGD,\nand contrasting to gradient descent and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics.\nMoreover, we obtain an explicit expression for the optimal linear rate by\nanalyzing the spectrum of the Witten-Laplacian, a special case of the\nSchr\\\"odinger operator associated with the lr-dependent SDE. Strikingly, this\nexpression clearly reveals the dependence of the linear convergence rate on the\nlearning rate -- the linear rate decreases rapidly to zero as the learning rate\ntends to zero for a broad class of nonconvex functions, whereas it stays\nconstant for strongly convex functions. Based on this sharp distinction between\nnonconvex and convex problems, we provide a mathematical interpretation of the\nbenefits of using learning rate decay for nonconvex optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 09:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-16"}

We use this result to calculate the sensitivity of new\nexperiments to low-mass axions using the quasi-static technique. First, we\ncalculate the current induced in an electric dipole antenna (straight\nconducting wire) when the DC B-field is spatially constant and show that it has\na sensitivity proportional to the axion mass. Following this we extend the\ntopology by making use of the full extent of the spatially varying DC B-field.\nThis extension is achieved by transforming the 1D conducting wire to a 2D\nwinding, to fully link the effective magnetic current boundary source and thus\ncouple to the full axion induced electrical action. In this case the conductor\nbecomes a coil winding where the voltage induced across the winding increases\nproportionally to the number of windings.

Arguably the discourse around the current epidemic will make use of\nwar-related metaphors too,not only in public discourse and the media, but also\nin the tweets written by non-experts of mass communication. We hereby present\nan analysis of the discourse around #Covid-19, based on a corpus of 200k tweets\nposted on Twitter during March and April 2020. Using topic modelling we first\nanalyze the topics around which the discourse can be classified. Then, we show\nthat the WAR framing is used to talk about specific topics, such as the virus\ntreatment, but not others, such as the effects of social distancing on the\npopulation. We then measure and compare the popularity of the WAR frame to\nthree alternative figurative frames (MONSTER, STORM and TSUNAMI) and a literal\nframe used as control (FAMILY). The results show that while the FAMILY literal\nframe covers a wider portion of the corpus, among the figurative framings WAR\nis the most frequently used, and thus arguably the most conventional one.\nHowever, we conclude, this frame is not apt to elaborate the discourse around\nmany aspects involved in the current situation. Therefore, we conclude, in line\nwith previous suggestions, a plethora of framing options, or a metaphor menu,\nmay facilitate the communication of various aspects involved in the\nCovid-19-related discourse on the social media, and thus support civilians in\nthe expression of their feelings, opinions and ideas during the current\npandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 10:14:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 10:26:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-05"}

Thus, their cardinality estimation is important for query\noptimization. In addition, a query planner requires the set-theoretic\ncardinality (i.e., without duplicates) for queries with DISTINCT as well as in\nplanning; for example, when considering sorting options. Yet, despite the\nimportance of estimating query cardinalities in the presence of DISTINCT, AND,\nOR, and NOT, many cardinality estimation methods are limited to estimating\ncardinalities of only conjunctive queries with duplicates counted.\n  The focus of this work is on two methods for handling this deficiency that\ncan be applied to any limited cardinality estimation model. First, we describe\na specialized deep learning scheme, PUNQ, which is tailored to representing\nconjunctive SQL queries and predicting the percentage of unique rows in the\nquery's result with duplicate rows. Using the predicted percentages obtained\nvia PUNQ, we are able to transform any cardinality estimation method that only\nestimates for conjunctive queries, and which estimates cardinalities with\nduplicates (e.g., MSCN), to a method that estimates queries cardinalities\nwithout duplicates. This enables estimating cardinalities of queries with the\nDISTINCT keyword. In addition, we describe a recursive algorithm, GenCrd, for\nextending any cardinality estimation method M that only handles conjunctive\nqueries to one that estimates cardinalities for more general queries (that\ninclude AND, OR, and NOT), without changing the method M itself.\n  Our evaluation is carried out on a challenging, real-world database with\ngeneral queries that include either the DISTINCT keyword or the AND, OR, and\nNOT operators. Experimentally, we show that the proposed methods obtain\naccurate cardinality estimates with the same level of accuracy as that of the\noriginal transformed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 11:20:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-16"}

We also show how these spectra can be\ncomputed in the presence of a realistic sky-mask and Gaussian noise.

These results will be valuable in analyzing\nhigher-order statistics from future all-sky weak lensing surveys such as the\n{\\em Euclid} survey at low-$\\ell$ modes.

Still, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is not high\nenough to effectively prevent the pandemic. The chest CT scan test provides a\nvaluable complementary tool to the RT-PCR test, and it can identify the\npatients in the early-stage with high sensitivity.

Sequential feature selection is used\nto identify the most informative measurements of each power plant so that\nmultivariate time series (MTS) can be constructed. By training the Mahalanobis\nmatrix, we measure and compare the distance between the MTSs. Templates for\nrepresenting each class is constructed to reduce the size of training datasets\nand improve the online matching efficiency. Dynamic time warping (DTW)\nalgorithm is used to align the out-of-sync MTSs to account for oscillation\ndetection errors. The algorithm is validated on two test systems: the IEEE\n39-bus system and the WECC 179-bus system. When a forced oscillation occurs,\nMTSs will be constructed by designated PMU measurements. Then, the MTSs will be\nclassified by the trained classifiers, the class membership of which\ncorresponds to the location of each oscillation source.

The tighter characteristic reduces the\nsearch space, therefore, as a natural conse-quence, significantly reduces the\ncomputational burden. In the literature, many tightened formulations for single\nunits with parts of constraints were reported without presenting how they were\nderived. In this paper, a sys-tematic approach is developed to formulate the\ntight formulations. The idea is using more new variables in high dimension\nspace to capture all the states for single units within three periods, and\nthen, using these state variables systematic derive three-periods locally ideal\nexpressions for a subset of the constraints in UC. Meanwhile, the linear\ndependence relations of those new state variables are leveraged to keep the\ncompactness of the obtained formulations. Based on this approach, we propose\ntwo tighter models, namely 3P-HD and 3P-HD-Pr. The proposed models and other\nfour state-of-the-art models were tested on 51 instances, including 42\nrealistic instances and 9 8-unit-based instances, over a scheduling period of\n24 h for systems ranging from 10 to 1080 generating units.

After using piecewise technique to approxi-mate the\nquadratic operational cost function, the six UC MIQP formulations can be\napproximated by six corre-sponding mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)\nformulations.

We collect a dataset of PPG\nmeasurements from a set of 15 users over the course of 6-11 sessions per user\nusing an iPhone X for the measurements. We design an authentication pipeline\nthat leverages the uniqueness of each individual's cardiovascular system,\nidentifying a set of distinctive features from each heartbeat. We conduct a set\nof experiments to evaluate the recognition performance of the PPG biometric\ntrait, including cross-session scenarios which have been disregarded in\nprevious work. We found that when aggregating sufficient samples for the\ndecision we achieve an EER as low as 8%, but that the performance greatly\ndecreases in the cross-session scenario, with an average EER of 20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 13:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-06"}

This lateral transport can be far from\nnegligible for small sinking velocities. To estimate its magnitude and\ndirection, the material is often modelled as a set of Lagrangian particles\nadvected by current velocities that are obtained from Ocean General Circulation\nModels (OGCMs). State-of-the-art OGCMs are strongly eddying, similar to the\nreal ocean, providing results with a spatial resolution on the order of 10 km\non a daily frequency. While the importance of eddies in OGCMs is\nwell-appreciated in the physical oceanographic community, other marine research\ncommunities may not. To demonstrate how much the absence of mesoscale features\nin low-resolution models influences the Lagrangian particle transport, we\nsimulate the transport of sinking Lagrangian particles using low- and\nhigh-resolution global OGCMs, and assess the lateral transport differences\nresulting from the difference in spatial and temporal model resolution. We find\nmajor differences between the transport in the non-eddying OGCM and in the\neddying OGCM. Addition of stochastic noise to the particle trajectories in the\nnon-eddying OGCM parameterises the effect of eddies well in some cases. The\neffect of a coarser temporal resolution (5-daily) is smaller compared to a\ncoarser spatial resolution (0.1$^{\\circ}$ versus 1$^{\\circ}$ horizontally). We\nrecommend to use sinking Lagrangian particles, representing e.g. marine snow,\nmicroplankton or sinking plastic, only with velocity fields from eddying OGCMs,\nrequiring high-resolution models in e.g. paleoceanographic studies.

In this approach, these objects can be understood as Bose-Einstein\ncondensates of weakly interacting gravitons.

However, it could be simply applied for classification branch, but\nstill remains challenging to adapt to regression branch due to its complex\ndesign and intrinsic requirement for high-quality online samples. To tackle\nthis issue, we present the fully convolutional online tracking framework,\ncoined as FCOT, and focus on enabling online learning for both classification\nand regression branches by using a target filter based tracking paradigm. Our\nkey contribution is to introduce an online regression model generator (RMG) for\ninitializing weights of the target filter with online samples and then\noptimizing this target filter weights based on the groundtruth samples at the\nfirst frame. Based on the online RGM, we devise a simple anchor-free tracker\n(FCOT), composed of a feature backbone, an up-sampling decoder, a multi-scale\nclassification branch, and a multi-scale regression branch. Thanks to the\nunique design of RMG, our FCOT can not only be more effective in handling\ntarget variation along temporal dimension thus generating more precise results,\nbut also overcome the issue of error accumulation during the tracking\nprocedure. In addition, due to its simplicity in design, our FCOT could be\ntrained and deployed in a fully convolutional manner with a real-time running\nspeed.

Even the state-of-the-art convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) based methods cannot obtain very satisfactory results. To more\naccurately locate the ships in diverse orientations, some recent methods\nconduct the detection via the rotated bounding box. However, it further\nincreases the difficulty of detection, because an additional variable of ship\norientation must be accurately predicted in the algorithm. In this paper, a\nnovel CNN-based ship detection method is proposed, by overcoming some common\ndeficiencies of current CNN-based methods in ship detection. Specifically, to\ngenerate rotated region proposals, current methods have to predefine\nmulti-oriented anchors, and predict all unknown variables together in one\nregression process, limiting the quality of overall prediction. By contrast, we\nare able to predict the orientation and other variables independently, and yet\nmore effectively, with a novel dual-branch regression network, based on the\nobservation that the ship targets are nearly rotation-invariant in remote\nsensing images. Next, a shape-adaptive pooling method is proposed, to overcome\nthe limitation of typical regular ROI-pooling in extracting the features of the\nships with various aspect ratios. Furthermore, we propose to incorporate\nmultilevel features via the spatially-variant adaptive pooling.

In this particular configuration, the\nplanet exhibits permanent dayside and nightside, which may induce strong\nday-night temperature gradients. The nightside temperature depends on the\nefficiency of the day-night heat redistribution and determines the stability of\nthe atmosphere against collapse. To better constrain the atmospheric stability,\nclimate, and surface conditions of rocky planets located in the habitable zone\nof their host star, it is thus crucial to understand the complex mechanism of\nheat redistribution. Building on early works and assuming dry thermodynamics,\nwe developed a hierarchy of analytic models taking into account the coupling\nbetween radiative transfer, dayside convection, and large-scale atmospheric\ncirculation in the case of slowly rotating planets. There are two types of\nthese models: a zero-dimensional two-layer approach and a two-column\nradiative-convective-subsiding-upwelling (RCSU) model. They yield analytical\nsolutions and scaling laws characterising the dependence of the collapse\npressure on physical features, which are compared to the results obtained by\nearly works using 3D global climate models (GCMs). The analytical theory\ncaptures (i) the dependence of temperatures on atmospheric opacities and\nscattering in the shortwave and in the longwave, (ii) the behaviour of the\ncollapse pressure observed in GCM simulations at low stellar fluxes that are\ndue to the non-linear dependence of the atmospheric opacity on the longwave\noptical depth at the planet's surface, (iii) the increase of stability\ngenerated by dayside sensible heating, and (iv) the decrease of stability\ninduced by the increase of the planet size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 15:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

A non-patterned\nsuperhydrophobic and a sticky hydrophobic surface acted as control wettability\nsurfaces. As expected, differences in wetting and heat transfer dynamics were\nnoticeable for all surfaces, with the most pronounced variation during the\nreceding phase. During spreading, inertia from the impact dominated the droplet\ndynamics and heat transfer was dominated by convection at the contact line and\ninternal flow. As contact line velocities decreased over time, evaporative\ncooling at the contact line gained importance, especially for the bi-phobic\nsurfaces, where liquid remained trapped on the hydrophobic spots during\nreceding. These satellite droplets increased the contact area and contact line\nlength, and assisted heat transfer and substrate cooling after lift-off of the\nmain droplet. Compared with the hydrophobic surface, the contribution of the\ncontact line heat transfer increased by 17 to 27% on the bi-phobic surfaces,\ndepending on the location of impact relative to the hydrophobic spots.\nNonetheless, the bi-phobic surfaces had a lower total thermal energy transfer.\nHowever, compared with the plain superhydrophobic surface, heat transfer was\nenhanced by 33% to 46% by patterning the surface. Depending on the application,\na trade-off exists between the different surfaces: the sticky hydrophobic\nsurface provides the best cooling efficiency, yet is prone to flooding, whereas\nthe superhydrophobic surface repels the liquid, but has poor cooling\nefficiency. The bi-phobic surfaces provide a middle path with reasonable\ncooling effectiveness and low flooding probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 15:33:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 15:07:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

In real-time operations, electric\nutilities are often left with few options for wildfire risk mitigation, leading\nto use of disruptive measures such as proactive de-energization of equipment,\nfrequently referred to as public safety power shut-offs. Such power shut-offs\nhave significant impacts on customers, who experience power cuts in an attempt\nto protect them from fires. This work proposes the optimal power shut-off\nproblem, an optimization model to support short-term operational decision\nmaking in the context of extreme wildfire risk. Specifically, the model\noptimizes grid operations to maximize the amount of power that can be\ndelivered, while proactively minimizing the risk of wildfire ignitions by\nselectively de-energizing components in the grid. This is the first\noptimization model to consider how preventive wildfire risk measures impact\nboth wildfire risk \\emph{and} power systems reliability at a short-term,\noperational time-frame. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on an\naugmented version of the RTS-GMLC test case, located in Southern California,\nand compared against two approaches based on simple risk thresholds.

With the aim of studying how current\nmultimodal algorithms based on heterogeneous sources of information are\naffected by sensitive elements and inner biases in the data, we propose a\nfictitious automated recruitment testbed: FairCVtest.

The question of the existence of stationary probability\nmeasures leads us to introduce a key combinatorial structure for words produced\nby a VLMC: the Longest Internal Suffix. This notion allows us to state a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for a general VLMC to admit a unique\ninvariant probability measure. This condition turns out to get a much simpler\nform for a subclass of VLMC: the stable VLMC. This natural subclass, unlike the\ngeneral case, enjoys a renewal property.

Unfortunately, this\ndiscrete time renewal process does not contain the whole information of the\nVLMC, preventing the study of a stable VLMC to be reduced to the study of its\ninduced semi-Markov chain. For a subclass of stable VLMC, the convergence in\ndistribution of a VLMC towards its stationary probability measure is\nestablished.

This ignorance\nstems from the lack of objective, pragmatic approaches for measuring training\ndoses in rehabilitation activities. Here, to develop a measurement approach, we\ntook the critical first step of automatically identifying functional\nprimitives, the basic building block of activities. Forty-eight individuals\nwith chronic stroke performed a variety of rehabilitation activities while\nwearing inertial measurement units (IMUs) to capture upper body motion.\nPrimitives were identified by human labelers, who labeled and segmented the\nassociated IMU data. We performed automatic classification of these primitives\nusing machine learning. We designed a convolutional neural network model that\noutperformed existing methods. The model includes an initial module to compute\nseparate embeddings of different physical quantities in the sensor data. In\naddition, it replaces batch normalization (which performs normalization based\non statistics computed from the training data) with instance normalization\n(which uses statistics computed from the test data). This increases robustness\nto possible distributional shifts when applying the method to new patients.\nWith this approach, we attained an average classification accuracy of 70%.\nThus, using a combination of IMU-based motion capture and deep learning, we\nwere able to identify primitives automatically.

Second, we argue that practical concerns lead us\nto increasingly standardize how we operationalize a substantive property; in\nother words, how we formalize the relationship between the substantive and\nnumerical properties of data. Thereby, we also standardize the interpretation\nof a property. With our increasing reliance on data and data technologies,\nthese two characteristics of data affect our collective conception of reality.\nStatistical data's exclusion of the fundamentally unique and equal influences\nour perspective on the world, and the standardization of substantive properties\ncan be viewed as profound ontological practice, entrenching ever more pervasive\ninterpretations of phenomena in our everyday lives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 14:47:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 12:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-21"}

Supervised models are further handicapped by domain shifts, when the\nlabeled dataset, despite being large enough, fails to cover different protocols\nor ethnicities. In this paper, we introduce \\emph{extreme consistency}, which\novercomes the above limitations, by maximally leveraging unlabeled data from\nthe same or a different domain in a teacher-student semi-supervised paradigm.\nExtreme consistency is the process of sending an extreme transformation of a\ngiven image to the student network and then constraining its prediction to be\nconsistent with the teacher network's prediction for the untransformed image.\nThe extreme nature of our consistency loss distinguishes our method from\nrelated works that yield suboptimal performance by exercising only mild\nprediction consistency. Our method is 1) auto-didactic, as it requires no extra\nexpert annotations; 2) versatile, as it handles both domain shift and limited\nannotation problems; 3) generic, as it is readily applicable to classification,\nsegmentation, and detection tasks; and 4) simple to implement, as it requires\nno adversarial training. We evaluate our method for the tasks of lesion and\nretinal vessel segmentation in skin and fundus images. Our experiments\ndemonstrate a significant performance gain over both modern supervised networks\nand recent semi-supervised models. This performance is attributed to the strong\nregularization enforced by extreme consistency, which enables the student\nnetwork to learn how to handle extreme variants of both labeled and unlabeled\nimages.
