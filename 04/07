Due to the nature of point clouds, i.e.\nunstructured, sparse and noisy, some features benefit-ting multi-class\ndiscrimination are underexploited, such as shape information. In this paper, we\npropose a novel 3D shape signature to explore the shape information from point\nclouds. By incorporating operations of symmetry, convex hull and chebyshev\nfitting, the proposed shape sig-nature is not only compact and effective but\nalso robust to the noise, which serves as a soft constraint to improve the\nfeature capability of multi-class discrimination. Based on the proposed shape\nsignature, we develop the shape signature networks (SSN) for 3D object\ndetection, which consist of pyramid feature encoding part, shape-aware grouping\nheads and explicit shape encoding objective. Experiments show that the proposed\nmethod performs remarkably better than existing methods on two large-scale\ndatasets. Furthermore, our shape signature can act as a plug-and-play component\nand ablation study shows its effectiveness and good scalability\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 16:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

The nodes of the network represent different\ntypes of individuals and the edges represent significant social relationships.\nAn epidemic is pictured as a contagion process that changes daily, triggered on\nday $0$ by a seed infection introduced into the population. Individuals' social\nbehaviour and health status are assumed to be random, with probability\ndistributions that vary with their type. First a formulation and analysis is\ngiven for the basic SI (\"susceptible-infective\") network contagion model, which\nfocusses on the cumulative number of people that have been infected. The main\nresult is an analytical formula valid in the large $N$ limit for the state of\nthe system on day $t$ in terms of the initial conditions. The formula involves\nonly one-dimensional integration. Next, more realistic SIR and SEIR network\nmodels, including \"removed\" (R) and \"exposed\" (E) classes, are formulated.\nThese models also lead to analytical formulas that generalize the results for\nthe SI network model. The framework can be easily adapted for analysis of\ndifferent kinds of public health interventions, including vaccination, social\ndistancing and quarantine. The formulas can be implemented numerically by an\nalgorithm that efficiently incorporates the fast Fourier transform. Finally a\nnumber of open questions and avenues of investigation are suggested, such as\nthe framework's relation to ordinary differential equation SIR models and agent\nbased contagion models that are more commonly used in real world epidemic\nmodelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 16:12:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 16:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

It turns out, fortunately, that many of these rapidly\ngrowing string collections are highly repetitive, so that their information\ncontent is orders of magnitude lower than their plain size. The statistical\ncompression methods used for classical collections, however, are blind to this\nrepetitiveness, and therefore a new set of techniques has been developed in\norder to properly exploit it. The resulting indexes form a new generation of\ndata structures able to handle the huge repetitive string collections that we\nare facing.\n  In this survey we cover the algorithmic developments that have led to these\ndata structures. We describe the distinct compression paradigms that have been\nused to exploit repetitiveness, the fundamental algorithmic ideas that form the\nbase of all the existing indexes, and the various structures that have been\nproposed, comparing them both in theoretical and practical aspects.

Existing\nscene understanding paradigms are able to parse only the visible parts,\nresulting in incomplete and unstructured scene interpretation. In this paper,\nwe investigate the problem of scene de-occlusion, which aims to recover the\nunderlying occlusion ordering and complete the invisible parts of occluded\nobjects. We make the first attempt to address the problem through a novel and\nunified framework that recovers hidden scene structures without ordering and\namodal annotations as supervisions. This is achieved via Partial Completion\nNetwork (PCNet)-mask (M) and -content (C), that learn to recover fractions of\nobject masks and contents, respectively, in a self-supervised manner. Based on\nPCNet-M and PCNet-C, we devise a novel inference scheme to accomplish scene\nde-occlusion, via progressive ordering recovery, amodal completion and content\ncompletion. Extensive experiments on real-world scenes demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our approach to other alternatives. Remarkably, our approach\nthat is trained in a self-supervised manner achieves comparable results to\nfully-supervised methods. The proposed scene de-occlusion framework benefits\nmany applications, including high-quality and controllable image manipulation\nand scene recomposition (see Fig. 1), as well as the conversion of existing\nmodal mask annotations to amodal mask annotations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 16:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

The field theory of the $(\\beta_x,\\beta_y)$ doublet is analogous\nto the theory of elasticity of a two-dimensional isotropic solid with distinct\nlongitudinal and transverse \"speeds of sound\". The well-known Heisenberg models\non the triangular and kagome lattices with nearest-neighbour exchange turn out\nto be special cases with accidental degeneracy of the spin-wave velocities. The\nspeeds of sound can be readily calculated for any lattice model. We apply this\napproach to the compounds of the Mn$_3$X family with stacked kagome layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 16:32:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 17:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

The large-scale flow on both Jupiter and Saturn appears to\nequilibrate towards a state which is close to marginal instability according to\nArnol'd's 2nd stability theorem. This scenario is largely reproduced in a\nhierarchy of numerical models of giant planet weather layers, including\nrelatively realistic models which seek to predict thermal and dynamical\nstructures using a full set of parameterisations of radiative transfer,\ninterior heat sources and even moist convection. Such models include the Jason\nGCM, developed in Oxford, which also represents the formation of (energetically\npassive) clouds of NH3, NH4SH and H2O condensates and the transport of\ncondensable tracers. Recent results show some promise in comparison with\nobservations from the Cassini and Juno missions, but some observed features\n(such as Jupiter's Great Red Spot and other compact ovals) are not yet captured\nspontaneously by any weather layer model. We review recent work in this vein\nand discuss a number of open questions for future study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 16:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

In this paper we explore the conditions for an optimal control\nof cascading failures in a system of interdependent networks. Specifically, we\nstudy the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile model incorporating a control mechanism,\nwhich affects the frequency of cascades occurring in individual layers. This\nmodification allows us to explore sandpile-like dynamics near the critical\nstate, with supercritical region corresponding to infrequent large cascades and\nsubcritical zone being characterized by frequent small avalanches. Topological\ncoupling between networks introduces dependence of control settings adopted in\nrespective layers, causing the control strategy of a given layer to be\ninfluenced by choices made in other connected networks. We find that the\noptimal control strategy for a layer operating in a supercritical regime is to\nbe coupled to a layer operating in a subcritical zone, since such condition\ncorresponds to reduced probability of inflicted avalanches. However this\ncondition describes a parasitic relation, in which only one layer benefits.\nSecond optimal configuration is a mutualistic one, where both layers adopt the\nsame control strategy. This work demonstrates that control protocols in systems\nof interdependent networks need to take into account higher-order organization\nof the system and cannot be designed independently, maximizing benefits only\nfor their individual layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 16:57:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

Methods: We used\nthe Koch Institute data on COVID-19 cases in Germany. To minimize the effect of\nchanges in healthcare seeking behavior and testing practices, we included the\nfollowing 5-year age groups in the analyses: 10-14y through 45-49y. For each\nage group g, we considered the proportion PL(g) of individuals in age group g\namong all detected cases aged 10-49y during weeks 13-14, 2020 (later period),\nas well as corresponding proportion PE(g) for weeks 10-11, 2020 (early period),\nand the relative risk RR(g)=PL(g)/PE(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, a\nhigher value of RR(g1) compared to RR(g2) is interpreted as the relative\nincrease in the population incidence of SARS-Cov-2 for g1 compared to g2 for\nthe later vs. early period.

Conclusions: The observed relative increase with time in\nthe prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y)\namong COVID-19 cases is unlikely to be explained by increases in the likelihood\nof seeking medical care/being tested for individuals in those age groups\ncompared to individuals aged 35-49y or 10-14y, suggesting an actual increase in\nthe prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the\nGerman population.

The novel loss is capable of solving a wider range of tasks including\nsimilarity learning, representation learning and data visualization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 17:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

Thus, there is a need for rigorously understanding the\nrelationships between different methods as well as their failure modes. In this\nwork, we conduct a thorough analysis of backpropagation-based saliency methods\nand propose a single framework under which several such methods can be unified.\nAs a result of our study, we make three additional contributions.

Second, we combine saliency\nmaps at different layers to test the ability of saliency methods to extract\ncomplementary information at different network levels (e.g.~trading off spatial\nresolution and distinctiveness) and we explain why some methods fail at\nspecific layers (e.g., Grad-CAM anywhere besides the last convolutional layer).\nThird, we introduce a class-sensitivity metric and a meta-learning inspired\nparadigm applicable to any saliency method for improving sensitivity to the\noutput class being explained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 17:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

This work tests the transient response of an idealized\nhurricane to instantaneous transitions in two key surface properties associated\nwith landfall: surface roughening and drying. Simplified axisymmetric\nexperiments are performed in CM1 where surface drag coefficient and evaporative\nfraction are each systematically modified beneath a mature hurricane. Surface\ndrying stabilizes the eyewall and consequently weakens the overturning\ncirculation, thereby reducing inward angular momentum transport that slowly\ndecays the wind field only within the inner-core. In contrast, surface\nroughening initially ($\\sim$12 hours) rapidly weakens the entire low-level wind\nfield and enhances the overturning circulation dynamically despite the\nconcurrent thermodynamic stabilization of the eyewall; thereafter the storm\ngradually decays similar to drying. As a result, total precipitation\ntemporarily increases with roughening but uniformly decreases with drying.\nStorm size decreases monotonically and rapidly with surface roughening, while\nthe radius of maximum wind can increase with moderate surface drying. Overall,\nthis work provides a mechanistic foundation for understanding the inland\nevolution of real storms in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 17:10:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 21:15:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

As a result\nof the preferred-direction mass collection, a velocity gradient perpendicular\nto the filament major axis is a common feature seen in simulations.

It is a\nchallenging task to determine their collective excitations as the unit cells\nare large and can contain complex textures. We address this issue in the oldest\nknown example of an emergent mesoscopic lattice, the vortex lattice in a\nsuperfluid. We show that a tight binding approach can successfully describe\ncollective modes. We begin with a single isolated vortex in a two dimensional\nsystem. With suitable pinning mechanims, the low energy excitations take the\nform of localized pairing fluctuations. They can be viewed as wave-like\ndisturbances that propagate around the vortex centre, in the azimuthal\ndirection. In particular, the lowest energy excitations are gyrotropic and\nbreathing modes. The former corresponds to circular motion of the eye of the\nvortex, while the latter represents an oscillation between sharper and broader\nvortex profiles. These modes are `bosonic' analogues of atomic orbitals with\nthe vortex profile playing the role of the nuclear potential. Moving to a\nsparse vortex lattice with well separated vortices, the single-vortex\nexcitations provide a convenient basis for finding normal modes.

HD 165054 is a bright\nstar within Baade's Window, a region of the galactic plane with relatively low\nextinction from interstellar dust. HD 165054 was selected as a calibrator\ntarget due to the high number density of stars within this region ($\\sim 3$\nstars per square arcsecond with $H<22$), necessary because of the small\nfield-of-view of the Gemini Planet Imager.

Pencil\nbeam (PB) model-based dose calculation is fast but inaccurate due to the\napproximation when dealing with inhomogeneities. Monte Carlo (MC) dose\ncalculation is the most accurate method, but it is time consuming. We\nhypothesize that deep learning methods can boost the accuracy of PB dose\ncalculation to the level of MC. In this work, we developed a deep learning\nmodel that converts PB to MC doses for different tumor sites. The proposed\nmodel is based on our newly developed hierarchically densely connected U-Net\n(HD U-Net) network, and it uses the PB dose and patient CT image as inputs to\ngenerate the MC dose. We used 290 patients (90 with head and neck, 93 with\nliver, 75 with prostate, and 32 with lung cancer) to train, validate, and test\nthe model. For each tumor site, we performed four numerical experiments to\nexplore various combinations of training datasets. Training the model on data\nfrom all tumor sites together and using the dose distribution of each\nindividual beam as input yielded the best performance for all four tumor sites.\nThe average gamma index (1mm/1% criteria) between the converted dose and the MC\ndose was 92.8%, 92.7%, 89.7% and 99.6% for head and neck, liver, lung, and\nprostate test patients, respectively. The average time for dose conversion for\na single field was less than 4 seconds. In conclusion, our deep learning-based\napproach can quickly boost the accuracy of proton PB dose distributions to that\nof MC dose distributions. The trained model can be readily adapted to new\ndatasets for different tumor sites and from different hospitals through\ntransfer learning. This model can be added as a plug-in to the clinical\nworkflow of proton therapy treatment planning to improve the accuracy of proton\ndose calculation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 18:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

We show that, in this case, no matter how $x\\in X$ is\npartitioned into blocks (as long as their lengths are sufficiently large and\nbounded), after ignoring a set $M$ of upper Banach density smaller than\n$\\varepsilon$, all blocks in the decomposition are ergodic. The first half of\nthe paper is concluded by examples showing, among other things, that the small\nset $M$, in both main theorems, cannot be avoided.\n  The second half of the paper is devoted to generalizing the two main results\ndescribed above to subshifts $X\\subset\\Lambda^G$ with the action of a countable\namenable group $G$. The role of long blocks is played by blocks whose domains\nare members of a F\\o lner sequence while the decomposition of $x\\in X$ into\nblocks (of which majority is ergodic) is obtained with the help of a congruent\nsystem of tilings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 19:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

During the last decade,\nthe integration of renewable energy sources, mainly photovoltaic installations\nand wind power plants, has led to a significant dynamic characteristic change\nin power systems. This change is mainly due to the fact that most renewables\nhave power electronics at the grid interface. The overall impact on stability\nand reliability analysis of power systems is very significant. The power\nsystems become more dynamic and require a new set of strategies modifying\ntraditional generation control algorithms. Indeed, renewable generation units\nare decoupled from the grid by electronic converters, decreasing the overall\ninertia of the grid.

Purpose: In this work, we construct the minimal\ncomplex-energy configuration interaction approach to describe binding energies\nand spectra of selected 5 $\\leq$ A $\\leq$ 11 nuclei. Method: We employ the\ncomplex-energy Gamow shell model (GSM) assuming a rigid $^4$He core. The\neffective Hamiltonian, consisting of a core-nucleon Woods-Saxon potential and a\nsimplified version of the Furutani-Horiuchi-Tamagaki interaction with the\nmass-dependent scaling, is optimized in the sp space. To diagonalize the\nHamiltonian matrix, we employ the Davidson method and the Density Matrix\nRenormalization Group technique. Results: Our optimized GSM Hamiltonian offers\na good reproduction of binding energies and spectra with the root-mean-square\n(rms) deviation from experiment of 160 keV. Since the model performs well when\nused to predict known excitations that have not been included in the fit, it\ncan serve as a reliable tool to describe poorly known states.

Of particular interest is niobium diselenide (NbSe2), whose\nsuperconducting state in few-layer samples is profoundly affected by an unusual\ntype of SOC called Ising SOC. Combined with the reduced dimensionality, the\nlatter stabilizes the superconducting state against magnetic fields up to ~35 T\nand could lead to other exotic properties such as nodal and crystalline\ntopological superconductivity. Here, we report transport measurements of\nfew-layer NbSe$_2$ under in-plane external magnetic fields, revealing an\nunexpected two-fold rotational symmetry of the superconducting state. In\ncontrast to the three-fold symmetry of the lattice, we observe that the\nmagnetoresistance and critical field exhibit a two-fold oscillation with\nrespect to an applied in-plane magnetic field. We find similar two-fold\noscillations deep inside the superconducting state in differential conductance\nmeasurements on NbSe$_2$/CrBr$_3$ superconductor-magnet junctions. In both\ncases, the anisotropy vanishes in the normal state, demonstrating that it is an\nintrinsic property of the superconducting phase. We attribute the behavior to\nthe mixing between two closely competing pairing instabilities, namely, the\nconventional s-wave instability typical of bulk NbSe$_2$ and an unconventional\nd- or p-wave channel that emerges in few-layer NbSe2. Our results thus\ndemonstrate the unconventional character of the pairing interaction in a\nfew-layer TMD, opening a new avenue to search for exotic superconductivity in\nthis family of 2D materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 21:21:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

By exploiting the equivalence of\nartificial neurons with quantized inputs/outputs and truth tables, we can train\nquantized neural networks that can be directly converted to a netlist of truth\ntables, and subsequently deployed as a highly pipelinable, massively parallel\nFPGA circuit. However, the neural network topology requires careful\nconsideration since the hardware cost of truth tables grows exponentially with\nneuron fan-in.

We evaluate our approach on\ntwo tasks with very high intrinsic throughput requirements in high-energy\nphysics and network intrusion detection.

Such a\nturbulence closure framework entails solving a system of equations comprised of\nML functionals coupled with traditional (physics-based - PB) elements. While\ncombining closure elements from fundamentally different ideologies can lead to\nunprecedented progress, there are many critical challenges that must be\novercome. This study examines three such challenges: (i) Physical compatibility\n(or lack thereof) between ML and PB constituents of the modeling system of\nequations; (ii) Internal (self) consistency of the ML training process; and\n(iii) Formulation of an optimal objective (or loss) function for training.\nThese issues are critically important for generalization of the ML-enhanced\nmethods to predictive computations of complex engineering flows.

Using the simple test\ncase of turbulent channel flow, key deficiencies are highlighted and proposals\nfor mitigating them are investigated.

Since autonomous vehicles need to\nnavigate in dynamically changing environments, they are expected to make\naccurate predictions regardless of where they are and what driving\ncircumstances they encountered. Several methodologies have been proposed to\nsolve prediction problems under different traffic situations. These works\nusually combine agent trajectories with either color-coded or vectorized high\ndefinition (HD) map as input representations and encode this information for\nbehavior prediction tasks. However, not all the information is relevant in the\nscene for the forecasting and such irrelevant information may be even\ndistracting to the forecasting in certain situations. Therefore, in this paper,\nwe propose a novel generic representation for various driving environments by\ntaking the advantage of semantics and domain knowledge. Using semantics enables\nsituations to be modeled in a uniform way and applying domain knowledge filters\nout unrelated elements to target vehicle's future behaviors. We then propose a\ngeneral semantic behavior prediction framework to effectively utilize these\nrepresentations by formulating them into spatial-temporal semantic graphs and\nreasoning internal relations among these graphs.

Network neuroscience and control theory offer useful\ntools that may guide improvements in parameter selection for control of\nanomalous neural activity. Here we use a novel method to characterize dynamic\ncontrollability across consecutive effective connectivity (EC) networks based\non regularized partial correlations between implanted electrodes during the\nonset, propagation, and termination phases of thirty-four seizures. We estimate\nregularized partial correlation adjacency matrices from one-second time windows\nof intracranial electrocorticography recordings using the Graphical Least\nAbsolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (GLASSO). Average and modal\ncontrollability metrics calculated from each resulting EC network track the\ntime-varying controllability of the brain on an evolving landscape of\nconditionally dependent network interactions. We show that average\ncontrollability increases throughout a seizure and is negatively correlated\nwith modal controllability throughout. Furthermore, our results support the\nhypothesis that the energy required to drive the brain to a seizure-free state\nfrom an ictal state is smallest during seizure onset; yet, we find that\napplying control energy at electrodes in the seizure onset zone may not always\nbe energetically favorable.

We\nuse the non extensive Tsallis statistics to find the entropic index in the\npartonic stages of the relativistic heavy ion collisions. We find that the\ntemperature and the entropic index have a linear relationship during the\npartonic stages of the heavy ion collision. This has already been observed in\nthe hadronic phase. A detailed analysis of the dependence of the entropic index\non the system shows that for increasing space time rapidity, the entropic index\nof the partonic system increases. The entropic index also depends on the beam\ncollision energy. The calculation of the entropic index from the experimental\ndata fitting of the transverse momenta deals with the hadronic phase.

Many\ncountries have enforced 2 - 4 weeks' lockdown and are extending the period\ndepending on their current disease scenario. Most probably the 14-day period of\nestimated communicability of COVID-19 prompted such decision. But the idea\nthat, if the susceptible population drops below certain threshold, the\ninfection would naturally die out in small communities after a fixed time\n(following the outbreak), unless the disease is reintroduced from outside, was\nproposed by Bartlett in 1957. This threshold was termed as Critical Community\nSize (CCS). Methods: We propose an SEIR model that explains COVID-19 disease\ndynamics. Using our model, we have calculated country-specific expected time to\nextinction (TTE) and CCS that would essentially determine the ideal number of\nlockdown days required and size of quarantined population. Findings: With the\ngiven country-wise rates of death, recovery and other parameters, we have\nidentified that, if at a place the total number of susceptible population drops\nbelow CCS, infection will cease to exist after a period of TTE days, unless it\nis introduced from outside. But the disease will almost die out much sooner. We\nhave calculated the country-specific estimate of the ideal number of lockdown\ndays. Thus, smaller lockdown phase is sufficient to contain COVID-19. On a\ncautionary note, our model indicates another rise in infection almost a year\nlater but on a lesser magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 04:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Despite substantial progress on\nthe topic, there exist several problems with the previous methods. First, there\nis a domain gap between training and testing pose sequences--the model is\ntested on poses it has not seen during training, such as difficult dancing\nmoves. Furthermore, pose detection errors are inevitable, making the job of the\ngenerator harder. Finally, generating realistic pixels from sparse poses is\nchallenging in a single step. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\npose-to-video translation framework for generating high-quality videos that are\ntemporally coherent even for in-the-wild pose sequences unseen during training.\nWe propose a pose augmentation method to minimize the training-test gap, a\nunified paired and unpaired learning strategy to improve the robustness to\ndetection errors, and two-stage network architecture to achieve superior\ntexture quality.

Secondly, we construct the logarithm\nedgemaps feature (LEF) based on lambertian model and local near neighbor\nfeature of the face image, applying to local region within multiple scales.\nThen, the illumination level is referenced to construct the high performance\nLEF as well realize adaptive fusion for multiple scales LEFs for the face\nimage, performing JLEF-feature. In addition, the constrain operation is used to\nremove the useless high-frequency interference, disentangling useful facial\nfeature edges and constructing AJLEF-face. Finally, the effects of the our\nmethods and other state-of-the-art algorithms including deep learning methods\nare tested on Extended Yale B, CMU PIE, AR as well as our Self-build Driver\ndatabase (SDB).

With such generators, it is hard to get prior knowledge on\nthe subset of tasks that are actually learnable at all (many generated tasks\nmay be unlearnable), what is their relative difficulty and what is the most\nefficient task distribution ordering for training. A typical solution in such\ncases is to rely on some form of Automated Curriculum Learning (ACL) to adapt\nthe sampling distribution. One limit of current approaches is their need to\nexplore the task space to detect progress niches over time, which leads to a\nloss of time. Additionally, we hypothesize that the induced noise in the\ntraining data may impair the performances of brittle DRL learners. We address\nthis problem by proposing a two stage ACL approach where 1) a teacher algorithm\nfirst learns to train a DRL agent with a high-exploration curriculum, and then\n2) distills learned priors from the first run to generate an \"expert\ncurriculum\" to re-train the same agent from scratch. Besides demonstrating 50%\nimprovements on average over the current state of the art, the objective of\nthis work is to give a first example of a new research direction oriented\ntowards refining ACL techniques over multiple learners, which we call Classroom\nTeaching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 07:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

At the interface, mass, momentum, and\nthermal coupling of the phases are also made accounting for all pertinent\nphysical aspects including several rarely considered interfacial phenomena such\nas Stefan flow of gas and the radiative heat transfer from interface to the\nsurroundings. The model developed utilizes temperature dependent properties in\nboth phases including the density and accounts for all relevant physics\nincluding Marangoni flow, which makes the model unprecedented. Moreover,\nutilizing this comprehensive model, a nonmonotonic interfacial temperature\ndistribution with double temperature dips is discovered for a hemispherical\ndroplet having internal convection due to buoyancy in the case of high\nsubstrate temperature.

This research field has achieved promising progress\nby using neural image inpainting methods. Nevertheless, there is still a\ncritical challenge in guessing the missed content with only the context pixels.\nThe goal of this paper is to fill the semantic information in corrupted images\naccording to the provided descriptive text. Unique from existing text-guided\nimage generation works, the inpainting models are required to compare the\nsemantic content of the given text and the remaining part of the image, then\nfind out the semantic content that should be filled for missing part. To\nfulfill such a task, we propose a novel inpainting model named Text-Guided Dual\nAttention Inpainting Network (TDANet). Firstly, a dual multimodal attention\nmechanism is designed to extract the explicit semantic information about the\ncorrupted regions, which is done by comparing the descriptive text and\ncomplementary image areas through reciprocal attention. Secondly, an image-text\nmatching loss is applied to maximize the semantic similarity of the generated\nimage and the text. Experiments are conducted on two open datasets. Results\nshow that the proposed TDANet model reaches new state-of-the-art on both\nquantitative and qualitative measures.

This is currently\nmissing in the state-of-the-art visual navigation methods based on\nReinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we propose to use externally\nlearned prior knowledge of the relative object locations and integrate it into\nour model by constructing a neural graph.

Our goal is to find the relation between the two-point correlation\nfunctions (CFs) of projected and spatial density fields of galaxies in the\ncontext of the cosmic web. Methods. To investigate relations between spatial\n(3D) and projected (2D) CFs of galaxies we used density fields of two\nsimulations: a $\\Lambda$-dominated cold dark matter (LCDM) model with known\nparticle data, and the Millennium simulation with know data on simulated\ngalaxies. We compare 3D and 2D correlation functions. In the 2D case, we use\nsamples of various thickness to find the dependence of 2D CFs on the thickness\nof samples. We also compare 3D CFs in real and redshift space. Results. The\ndominant elements of the cosmic web are clusters and filaments, separated by\nvoids filling most of the volume. In individual 2D sheets, the positions of\nclusters and filaments do not coincide. As a result, in projection, the\nclusters and filaments fill in 2D voids. This leads to a decrease in the\namplitudes of CFs (and power spectra) in projection. For this reason, the\namplitudes of 2D CFs are lower than the amplitudes of 3D correlation functions:\nthe thicker the 2D sample, the greater the difference. Conclusions.

In an equilibrium perspective, for a given ensemble of\nparticle positions, we analyze both the associated mean settling speed and the\nvelocity fluctuations of individual particles. In the 1970s, Batchelor gave a\nproper definition of the mean settling speed, a 60-year-old open problem in\nphysics, based on the appropriate renormalization of long-range particle\ncontributions. In the 1980s, a celebrated formal calculation by Caflisch and\nLuke suggested that velocity fluctuations in dimension $d=3$ should diverge\nwith the size of the sedimentation tank, contradicting both intuition and\nexperimental observations. The role of long-range self-organization of\nsuspended particles in form of hyperuniformity was later put forward to explain\nadditional screening of this divergence in steady-state observations. In the\npresent contribution, we develop the first rigorous theory that allows to\njustify all these formal calculations of the physics literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 10:28:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 17:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-15"}

The disadvantage of a lower write endurance, compared to\nDRAM, of NVM technologies like Phase-Change Memory (PCM) or Ferroelectric RAM\n(FeRAM) has been addressed in the literature. As a solution, in-memory\nwear-leveling techniques have been proposed, which aim to balance the\nwear-level over all memory cells to achieve an increased memory lifetime.\nGenerally, to apply such advanced aging-aware wear-leveling techniques proposed\nin the literature, additional special hardware is introduced into the memory\nsystem to provide the necessary information about the cell age and thus enable\naging-aware wear-leveling decisions.\n  This paper proposes software-only aging-aware wear-leveling based on common\nCPU features and does not rely on any additional hardware support from the\nmemory subsystem. Specifically, we exploit the memory management unit (MMU),\nperformance counters, and interrupts to approximate the memory write counts as\nan aging indicator. Although the software-only approach may lead to slightly\nworse wear-leveling, it is applicable on commonly available hardware. We\nachieve page-level coarse-grained wear-leveling by approximating the current\ncell age through statistical sampling and performing physical memory remapping\nthrough the MMU. This method results in non-uniform memory usage patterns\nwithin a memory page. Hence, we further propose a fine-grained wear-leveling in\nthe stack region of C / C++ compiled software.\n  By applying both wear-leveling techniques, we achieve up to $78.43\\%$ of the\nideal memory lifetime, which is a lifetime improvement of more than a factor of\n$900$ compared to the lifetime without any wear-leveling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 10:33:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 17:05:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-09"}

A hyperbolic reformulation of the Serre-Green-Naghdi model\nfor nonlinear dispersive free surface flows is coupled with a first order\nvelocity-stress formulation for linear elastic wave propagation in the sea\nbottom. Cartesian non-conforming meshes are defined and the coupling is\nachieved by an appropriate time-dependent pressure boundary condition in the\nthree-dimensional domain for the elastic wave propagation, where the pressure\nis a combination of hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic pressure in the water\ncolumn above the sea bottom. The use of a first order hyperbolic reformulation\nof the nonlinear dispersive free surface flow model leads to a straightforward\ncoupling with the linear seismic wave equations, which are also written in\nfirst order hyperbolic form. It furthermore allows the use of explicit time\nintegrators with a rather generous CFL-type time step restriction associated\nwith the dispersive water waves, compared to numerical schemes applied to\nclassical dispersive models. Since the two systems employed are written in the\nsame form of a first order hyperbolic system they can also be efficiently\nsolved in a unique numerical framework. We choose the family of arbitrary high\norder accurate discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes. The developed\nmethodology is carefully assessed by first considering several benchmarks for\neach system separately showing a good agreement with exact and numerical\nreference solutions. Finally, also coupled test cases are addressed. Throughout\nthis paper we assume the elastic deformations in the solid to be sufficiently\nsmall so that their influence on the free surface water waves can be neglected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 10:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

The decentralization of information is expressed\naccording to sparsity constraints on the state measurements that each local\ncontroller has access to. In this context, we investigate the design of\ndecentralized controllers that are affinely parameterized in their measurement\nhistory. For problems with partially nested information structures, the\noptimization over such policy spaces is known to be convex.

We\nobtain this result by means of two complementary methods, one based on the\neffective low-energy Dirac equation description and the other on a fully\nnumerical tight-binding approach, finding excellent agreement between the two.\nWe then show how transport measurements might reveal the presence of\nVolkov-Pankratov states, and discuss possible graphene-like structures in which\nsuch states might be observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 11:59:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 12:04:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

New, independent methods to robustly test\nthe cosmic isotropy are of crucial importance. In this work, we investigate the\ndirectional behavior of the X-ray luminosity-temperature ($L_X-T$) relation of\ngalaxy clusters. A tight correlation exists between the luminosity and\ntemperature of the X-ray-emitting intracluster medium. While the measured\nluminosity depends on the underlying cosmology, the temperature can be\ndetermined without any cosmological assumptions. By exploiting this property\none can effectively test the isotropy of cosmological parameters over the full\nextragalactic sky. Here, we used 313 homogeneously selected X-ray galaxy\nclusters from the MCXC catalog and obtained core-excised temperatures for all\nof them. We find that the behavior of the $L_X-T$ relation heavily depends on\nthe direction of the sky. Strong anisotropies are detected at a $\\sim 4\\sigma$\nlevel toward $(l,b)\\sim (280^{\\circ}, -20^{\\circ})$. Several X-ray and\ncluster-related effects that could potentially explain these anisotropies were\nexamined, but none did so. Interestingly, two other available cluster samples\nappear to have a similar behavior throughout the sky, while being fully\nindependent of each other and our sample. Performing a joint analysis of the\nthree samples, the final anisotropy is further intensified ($\\sim 5\\sigma$),\ntoward $(l,b)\\sim (303^{\\circ}, -27^{\\circ})$, which is in good agreement with\nother cosmological probes. This result demonstrates that X-ray galaxy cluster\nstudies that assume perfect isotropy can produce strongly biased results\nwhether the underlying reason is cosmological or related to X-rays. The\nidentification of the exact nature of these anisotropies is therefore crucial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 12:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-09"}

Due to the dynamic development of infections and the\ntime lag between when patients are infected and when a proportion of them\nenters an intensive care unit (ICU), the need for future intensive care can\neasily be underestimated. To infer future ICU load from reported infections, we\nsuggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2)\nallows for making predictions depending on different future growth of\ninfections. We have evaluated our model for three regions, namely Berlin\n(Germany), Lombardy (Italy), and Madrid (Spain). Before extensive containment\nmeasures made an impact, we first estimate the region-specific model\nparameters. Whereas for Berlin, an ICU rate of 6%, a time lag of 6 days, and an\naverage stay of 12 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data, for Lombardy\nand Madrid the ICU rate was higher (18% and 15%) and the time lag (0 and 3\ndays) and the average stay (4 and 8 days) in ICU shorter. The region-specific\nmodels are then used to predict future ICU load assuming either a continued\nexponential phase with varying growth rates (0-15%) or linear growth. Thus, the\nmodel can help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity. Although our\npredictions are based on small data sets and disregard non-stationary dynamics,\nour model is simple, robust, and can be used in early phases of the disease\nwhen data are scarce.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 17:54:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 14:50:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

Especially when combined with other difficulty factors,\nsuch as the presence of noise, overlapping class distributions, and small\ndisjuncts, data imbalance can significantly impact the classification\nperformance. Furthermore, some of the data difficulty factors are known to\naffect the performance of the existing oversampling strategies, in particular\nSMOTE and its derivatives. This effect is especially pronounced in the\nmulti-class setting, in which the mutual imbalance relationships between the\nclasses complicate even further. Despite that, most of the contemporary\nresearch in the area of data imbalance focuses on the binary classification\nproblems, while their more difficult multi-class counterparts are relatively\nunexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel oversampling technique, a\nMulti-Class Combined Cleaning and Resampling (MC-CCR) algorithm. The proposed\nmethod utilizes an energy-based approach to modeling the regions suitable for\noversampling, less affected by small disjuncts and outliers than SMOTE. It\ncombines it with a simultaneous cleaning operation, the aim of which is to\nreduce the effect of overlapping class distributions on the performance of the\nlearning algorithms. Finally, by incorporating a dedicated strategy of handling\nthe multi-class problems, MC-CCR is less affected by the loss of information\nabout the inter-class relationships than the traditional multi-class\ndecomposition strategies.

Unlike state-of-the-art SDN-inspired solutions for\ncellular networking, CellOS: (i) Hides low-level network details through a\ngeneral virtual network abstraction; (ii) allows TOs to define high-level\ncontrol objectives to dictate the desired network behavior without requiring\nknowledge of optimization techniques, and (iii) automatically generates and\nexecutes distributed control programs for simultaneous optimization of\nheterogeneous control objectives on multiple network slices. CellOS has been\nimplemented and evaluated on an indoor testbed with two different LTE-compliant\nimplementations: OpenAirInterface and srsLTE. We further demonstrated CellOS\ncapabilities on the long-range outdoor POWDER-RENEW PAWR 5G platform. Results\nfrom scenarios with multiple base stations and users show that CellOS is\nplatform-independent and self-adapts to diverse network deployments. Our\ninvestigation shows that CellOS outperforms existing solutions on key metrics,\nincluding throughput (up to 86% improvement), energy efficiency (up to 84%) and\nfairness (up to 29%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 14:07:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 01:01:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 19:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

Here, a crystal direction\ndependent dry etching principle in an inductively-coupled plasma reactive ion\netcher is presented, which allows to selectively reveal desired crystal planes\nin monocrystalline diamond by controlling the etching conditions. The principle\nis demonstrated when the kinetic energy of incident ions on diamond surfaces is\nreduced below a certain threshold leading to anisotropic etching and faceting\nalong specific crystal planes.

In general, this leads to optimization\nproblems with large number of constraints. Thus, the use of a working-set\noptimization algorithm is proposed. The main idea is to solve a sequence of\nrelaxed optimization sub-problems with a small sub-set of all constraints. The\nalgorithm terminates once a solution of a sub-problem is found that satisfies\nall the constraints of the problem. The retrofitting cost is minimized with\nconstraints on the inter-story drifts at the peripheries of frame structures.\nThe structures considered are subjected to a realistic ensemble of ground\nmotions, and their response is evaluated with time-history analyses. The\ntransient optimization problem is efficiently solved with a gradient-based\nsequential linear programming algorithm. The gradients of the response\nfunctions are calculated with a consistent adjoint sensitivity analysis\nprocedure. Promising results attained for 3-D irregular frames are presented\nand discussed.

In spite of the\navailability of data from multiple markets, current approaches in trading rely\nmainly on learning trading strategies per individual market. In this paper, we\ntake a step towards developing fully end-to-end global trading strategies that\nleverage systematic trends to produce superior market-specific trading\nstrategies. We introduce QuantNet: an architecture that learns market-agnostic\ntrends and use these to learn superior market-specific trading strategies. Each\nmarket-specific model is composed of an encoder-decoder pair. The encoder\ntransforms market-specific data into an abstract latent representation that is\nprocessed by a global model shared by all markets, while the decoder learns a\nmarket-specific trading strategy based on both local and global information\nfrom the market-specific encoder and the global model. QuantNet uses recent\nadvances in transfer and meta-learning, where market-specific parameters are\nfree to specialize on the problem at hand, whilst market-agnostic parameters\nare driven to capture signals from all markets. By integrating over\nidiosyncratic market data we can learn general transferable dynamics, avoiding\nthe problem of overfitting to produce strategies with superior returns. We\nevaluate QuantNet on historical data across 3103 assets in 58 global equity\nmarkets. Against the top performing baseline, QuantNet yielded 51% higher\nSharpe and 69% Calmar ratios.

Surprisingly,\nsulphuretted molecules are not as abundant as expected in the interstellar\nmedium, and the identity of the main sulphur reservoir is still an open\nquestion. Our goal is to investigate the H$_{2}$S chemistry in dark clouds, as\nthis stable molecule is a potential sulphur reservoir. Using millimeter\nobservations of CS, SO, H$_{2}$S, and their isotopologues, we determine the\nphysical conditions and H$_{2}$S abundances along the cores TMC 1-C, TMC 1-CP,\nand Barnard 1b. The gas-grain model Nautilus is then used to model the sulphur\nchemistry and explore the impact of photo-desorption and chemical desorption on\nthe H$_2$S abundance. Our model shows that chemical desorption is the main\nsource of gas-phase H$_2$S in dark cores. The measured H$_{2}$S abundance can\nonly be fitted if we assume that the chemical desorption rate decreases by more\nthan a factor of 10 when $n_{\\rm H}>2\\times10^{4}$. This change in the\ndesorption rate is consistent with the formation of thick H$_2$O and CO ice\nmantles on grain surfaces. The observed SO and H$_2$S abundances are in good\nagreement with our predictions adopting an undepleted value of the sulphur\nabundance. However, the CS abundance is overestimated by a factor of $5-10$.\nAlong the three cores, atomic S is predicted to be the main sulphur reservoir.\nWe conclude that the gaseous H$_2$S abundance is well reproduced, assuming\nundepleted sulphur abundance and chemical desorption as the main source of\nH$_2$S. The behavior of the observed H$_{2}$S abundance suggests a changing\ndesorption efficiency, which would probe the snowline in these cores. Our\nmodel, however, overestimates the observed gas-phase CS abundance. Given the\nuncertainty in the sulphur chemistry, our data are consistent with a cosmic\nelemental S abundance with an uncertainty of a factor of 10.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 15:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

Many models therefore use small km-sized\nplanetesimals, or invoke the accretion of pebbles. Furthermore, models based on\nplanetesimal accretion often use the ad hoc assumption of planetesimals\ndistributed radially in a minimum mass solar nebula fashion. We wish to\ninvestigate the impact of various initial radial density distributions in\nplanetesimals with a dynamical model for the formation of planetesimals on the\nresulting population of planets. In doing so, we highlight the directive role\nof the early stages of dust evolution into pebbles and planetesimals in the\ncircumstellar disk on the following planetary formation. We have implemented a\ntwo population model for solid evolution and a pebble flux regulated model for\nplanetesimal formation into our global model for planet population synthesis.\nThis framework is used to study the global effect of planetesimal formation on\nplanet formation. As reference, we compare our dynamically formed planetesimal\nsurface densities with ad-hoc set distributions of different radial density\nslopes of planetesimals. Even though required, it is not solely the total\nplanetesimal disk mass, but the planetesimal surface density slope and\nsubsequently the formation mechanism of planetesimals, that enables planetary\ngrowth via planetesimal accretion. Highly condensed regions of only 100 km\nsized planetesimals in the inner regions of circumstellar disks can lead to gas\ngiant growth. Pebble flux regulated planetesimal formation strongly boosts\nplanet formation, because it is a highly effective mechanism to create a steep\nplanetesimal density profile. We find this to lead to the formation of giant\nplanets inside 1 au by 100 km already by pure planetesimal accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 15:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Instead, each design automation tool lowers HDLs\nto its own Intermediate Representation (IR). These tools are monolithic and\nmostly proprietary, disagree in their implementation of HDLs, and while many\nredundant IRs exists, no IR today can be used through the entire circuit design\nflow. To solve this problem, we propose the LLHD multi-level IR. LLHD is\ndesigned as simple, unambiguous reference description of a digital circuit, yet\nfully captures existing HDLs. We show this with our reference compiler on\ndesigns as complex as full CPU cores. LLHD comes with lowering passes to a\nhardware-near structural IR, which readily integrates with existing tools. LLHD\nestablishes the basis for innovation in HDLs and tools without redundant\ncompilers or disjoint IRs. For instance, we implement an LLHD simulator that\nruns up to 2.4x faster than commercial simulators but produces equivalent,\ncycle-accurate results. An initial vertically-integrated research prototype is\ncapable of representing all levels of the IR, implements lowering from the\nbehavioural to the structural IR, and covers a sufficient subset of\nSystemVerilog to support a full CPU design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 15:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

To bring\nback direct salience estimation for summarization with neural networks, we\npropose a Multi-Attention Learning framework which contains two new attention\nlearning components for salience estimation: supervised attention learning and\nunsupervised attention learning.

Previous\nresearch suggests that radicalized individuals are destabilized by various\nenvironmental (or endemic) factors, exposed to extremist ideology, and\nsubsequently reinforced by members of their community. As such, the spread of\nradicalization may proceed through a social contagion process, in which\nextremist ideologies behave like complex contagions that require multiple\nexposures for adoption. In this study, I applied an epidemiological method\ncalled two-component spatio-temporal intensity modeling to data from 416\nfar-right extremists exposed in the United States between 2005 and 2017. The\nresults indicate that patterns of far-right radicalization in the United States\nare consistent with a complex contagion process, in which reinforcement is\nrequired for transmission. Both social media usage and group membership enhance\nthe spread of extremist ideology, suggesting that online and physical\norganizing remain primary recruitment tools of the far-right movement.\nAdditionally, I identified several endemic factors, such as poverty, that\nincrease the probability of radicalization in particular regions. Future\nresearch should investigate how specific interventions, such as online\ncounter-narratives to battle propaganda, may be effectively implemented to\nmitigate the spread of far-right extremism in the United States.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 19:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-10"}

Recurrent Neural Network\n(RNN)-based sequential recommendation is a popular approach that utilizes\nusers' recent browsing history to predict future items. This approach is\nlimited that it does not consider the societal influences of news consumption,\ni.e., users may follow popular topics that are constantly changing, while\ncertain hot topics might be spreading only among specific groups of people.\nSuch societal impact is difficult to predict given only users' own reading\nhistories. On the other hand, the traditional User-based Collaborative\nFiltering (UserCF) makes recommendations based on the interests of the\n\"neighbors\", which provides the possibility to supplement the weaknesses of\nRNN-based methods. However, conventional UserCF only uses a single similarity\nmetric to model the relationships between users, which is too coarse-grained\nand thus limits the performance.

Firstly, we build a directed co-reading network of users, to\ncapture the fine-grained topic-specific similarities between users in a vector\nspace. Then, the CSRN model encodes users with RNNs, and learns to attend to\nneighbors and summarize what news they are reading at the moment.

However, most of the existing link-selection strategies\nare designed based on perfect channel state information (CSI), which are very\ncomplex by requiring channel estimator. To solve this issue, in this paper, we\ninvestigate a buffer-aided differential chaos-shift-keying based simultaneous\nwireless information and power transfer (DCSK-SWIPT) relay system, where a\ndecode-and-forward protocol is considered and the relay is equipped with a data\nbuffer and an energy buffer. In particular, we propose two link-selection\nprotocols for the proposed system based on harvested energy, data-buffer status\nand energy-shortage status, where the CSI is replaced by the harvested energy\nto avoid the channel estimation and the practical problem of the decoding cost\nat the relay is considered. Furthermore, the bit-error-rate (BER) and\naverage-delay closed-form expressions of the proposed protocols are derived\nover multipath Rayleigh fading channels, which are validated via simulations.\nFinally, results demonstrate that both the proposed protocols not only provide\nbetter BER performance than the conventional DCSK system and DCSK-SWIPT relay\nsystem but also achieve better BER performance and lower average delay in\ncomparison to the conventional signal-to-noise-ratio-based buffer-aided\nDCSK-SWIPT relay systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 13:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-11"}

Medical images always have large sizes and\nthey are commonly corrupted by single or multiple noise type at the same time,\ndue to various reasons, these two reasons are the triggers for moving toward\nparallel image processing to find alternatives of image de-noising techniques.\nThis paper presents a parallel hybrid filter implementation for gray scale\nmedical image de-noising. The hybridization is between adaptive median and\nwiener filters. Parallelization is implemented on the adaptive median filter to\novercome the latency of neighborhood operation, parfor implicit parallelism\npowered by MatLab 2013a is used. The implementation is tested on an image of\n2.5 MB size, which is divided into 2, 4 and 8 partitions; a comparison between\nthe proposed implementation and sequential implementation is given, in terms of\ntime. Thus, each case has the best time when assigned to number of threads\nequal to the number of its partitions. Moreover, Speed up and efficiency are\ncalculated for the algorithm and they show a measured enhancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 23:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

Through the smart devices, people remain\nconnected with systems across the globe even in mobile state. Hence, the\ncurrent Internet is facing scalability issue. Therefore, leaving IP based\nInternet behind due to scalability, the world is moving to the Future Internet\nArchitecture, called Named Data Networking (NDN). Currently, the number of\nnodes connected to the Internet is in billions. And, the number of requests\nsent is in millions per second. NDN handles such huge numbers by modifying the\nIP architecture to meet the current requirements. NDN is scalable, produces\nless traffic and congestion, provides high level security, saves bandwidth,\nefficiently utilizes multiple network interfaces and have many more\nfunctionalities. Similarly, Bloom Filter is the only good choice to deploy in\nvarious modules of NDN to handle the huge number of packets. Bloom Filter is a\nsimple probabilistic data structure for the membership query. This article\npresents a detailed discussion on the role of Bloom Filter in implementing NDN.\nThe article includes a precise discussion on Bloom Filter and the main\ncomponents of the NDN architecture, namely, packet, content store, forward\ninformation base and pending interest table are also discussed briefly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 13:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

The nonlinearity is due to the moderate macrorotations of the plate\nwhich are modeled by including the von Karman strains in the micropolar strain\nmeasures. Weak form Galerkin method with linear Lagrange interpolations is used\nto develop the displacement-based finite element model. Selective reduced\nintegration is used to eliminate shear locking and membrane locking. The novel\nfinite element model is used to study the nonlinear bending and linear free\nvibrations of web-core and pyramid core sandwich panels. Clamped and free edge\nboundary conditions are considered for the first time for the 2-D micropolar\nESL-FSDT plate theory. The present 2-D finite element results are in good\nagreement with the corresponding detailed 3-D FE results for the lattice core\nsandwich panels.

The architectured chiral material is\nmade up of a periodic repetition of square or hexagonal rigid and heavy blocks\nconnected by linear elastic interfaces, whose chirality results from an equal\nrotation of the blocks with respect to the line connecting their centroids. The\ngoverning equation of the Lagrangian model is derived and a hermitian\neigenproblem is formulated to obtain the frequency band structure. An\nequivalent micropolar continuum is analytically derived through a standard\ncontinualization approach in agreement with the procedure proposed by\nBacigalupo and Gambarotta (2017) from which an approximation of the frequency\nspectrum is derived. Moreover, the overall elastic moduli of the equivalent\nCauchy continuum are obtained in closed form via a proper condensation\nprocedure. The parametric analysis involving the overall elastic moduli of the\nCauchy equivalent continuum model and the frequency band structure is carried\nout to catch the influence of the chirality angle and of the ratio between the\ntangential and normal stiffness of the interface. Finally, it is shown how\nchirality and interface stiffness may affect strong auxeticity and how the\nequivalent micropolar model provides dispersion curves in excellent agreement\nwith the current ones for a wide range of the wave vector magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 07:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}
