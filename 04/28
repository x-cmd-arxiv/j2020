In doing this we use $3$ million galaxies to\nrecalibrate the astrometry and set up a common reference frame between the two\ncatalogues. The exquisite depth and the nearly $12$ years of time baseline\nbetween HSC and SDSS enable high-precision measurements of statistical proper\nmotions for stars down to $i\\simeq 24$. A validation of our method is\ndemonstrated by the agreement with the $Gaia$ proper motions, to the precision\nbetter than $0.1$ mas yr$^{-1}$. To retain the precision, we make a correction\nof the subtle effects due to the differential chromatic refraction in the SDSS\nimages based on the comparison with the $Gaia$ proper motions against colour of\nstars, which is validated using the SDSS spectroscopic quasars. Combining with\nthe photometric distance estimates for individual stars based on the precise\nHSC photometry, we show a significant detection of the net proper motions for\nstars in each bin of distance out to $100$ kpc. The two-component tangential\nvelocities after subtracting the apparent motions due to our own motion display\nrich phase-space structures including a clear signature of the Sagittarius\nstream in the halo region of distance range $[10,\\ 35]$ kpc. We also measure\nthe tangential velocity dispersion in the distance range $5-20$ kpc and find\nthat the data are consistent with a constant isotropic dispersion of $80\\pm 10\\\n{\\rm km/s}$.

To address this,\nwe present two minimal branching process models of cell division and\ndifferentiation in a well-mixed population.

As a consequence, they\nnever reach thermal equilibrium, thus prohibiting production by freeze-out. We\nnote that this limitation is alleviated if the neutrino Yukawa coupling is\nlarge enough in the early Universe to thermalize the sterile neutrinos, and\nthen becomes tiny at a certain moment, which makes them drop out of\nequilibrium. As a concrete example realization of this framework, we consider a\nFroggatt-Nielsen model supplemented by an additional scalar field which obeys a\nglobal symmetry (not the flavour symmetry). Initially, the vacuum expectation\nvalue of the flavon is such, that the effective neutrino Yukawa coupling is\nlarge and unsuppressed, keeping them in thermal equilibrium. At some point the\nnew scalar also gets a vacuum expectation value that breaks the symmetry. This\nmay occur in such a way that the vev of the flavon is shifted to a new\n(smaller) value. In that case, the Yukawa coupling is reduced such that the\nsterile neutrinos are rendered stable on cosmological time scales.

In contrast, classical machine learning, which we define as, starts from\na blank slate, or tabula rasa and uses data only for the single task at hand.\nWhile typical transfer learning algorithms can improve performance on future\ntasks, their performance on prior tasks degrades upon learning new tasks\n(called forgetting). Many recent approaches for continual or lifelong learning\nhave attempted to maintain performance on old tasks given new tasks. But\nstriving to avoid forgetting sets the goal unnecessarily low. The goal of\nlifelong learning should be not only to improve performance on future tasks\n(forward transfer) but also on past tasks (backward transfer) with any new\ndata. Our key insight is that we can synergistically ensemble representations\n-- that were learned independently on disparate tasks -- to enable both forward\nand backward transfer. This generalizes ensembling decisions (like in decision\nforests) and complements ensembling dependently learned representations (like\nin multitask learning). Moreover, we can ensemble representations in\nquasilinear space and time. We demonstrate this insight with two algorithms:\nrepresentation ensembles of (1) trees and (2) networks. Both algorithms\ndemonstrate forward and backward transfer in a variety of simulated and\nbenchmark data scenarios, including tabular, image, and spoken, and adversarial\ntasks.

At present time the problem of finding a rigorous relation\nbetween $m_t^{\\rm MC}$ and top mass renormalization schemes defined in field\ntheory is unresolved and touches perturbative as well as nonperturbative\naspects and the limitations of state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo event generators. I\nreview the status of LHC top mass measurements, illustrate how conceptual\nlimitations enter and explain a controversy that has permeated the community in\nthe context of the interpretation problem. Recent advances in acquiring first\nprinciple insights are summarized, and it is outlined what else has to be\nunderstood to fully resolve the issue. For the time being, I give a\nrecommendation how to deal with the interpretation problem when making top mass\ndependent theoretical predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 16:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

The\ncombined contribution of shocked ambient medium and ejecta to the X-ray\nemission complicates the determination of the ejecta mass and chemical\ncomposition, leading to big uncertainties in mass estimates and it can\nintroduce a bias in the comparison between the observed ejecta composition and\nthe yields predicted by explosive nucleosynthesis. We explore the capabilities\nof present and future spectral instruments with the aim of identifying a\nspectral feature which may allow us to discriminate between metal-rich and\npure-metal plasmas in X-ray spectra of SNRs. We studied the behavior of the\nmost common X-ray emission processes of an optically thin plasma in the\nhigh-abundance regime. We investigated spectral features of bremsstrahlung,\nradiative recombination continua (RRC) and line emission, by exploring a wide\nrange of chemical abundances, temperatures and ionization parameters.

We show that $\\mathbf{Mod}$\ndoes not have pullbacks and so cannot form a model 2-category. This lack of\npullbacks can be traced to the two-out-of-three axiom on the weak equivalences\nof a model category. Accordingly, we define a premodel category to be a\ncomplete and cocomplete category equipped with two nested weak factorization\nsystems. Combinatorial premodel categories form a complete and cocomplete\nclosed symmetric monoidal 2-category $\\mathbf{CPM}$ whose tensor product\nrepresents Quillen bifunctors. For a monoidal combinatorial premodel category\n$V$, the 2-category $V\\mathbf{CPM}$ of $V$-enriched combinatorial premodel\ncategories is simply the category of modules over $V$ (viewed as a monoid\nobject of $\\mathbf{CPM}$), and therefore inherits the algebraic structure of\n$\\mathbf{CPM}$.\n  The homotopy theory of a model category depends in an essential way on the\nweak equivalences, so it does not extend directly to a general premodel\ncategory.

Owing to dissociation by starlight, the thinnest shells are expected to\nhost low molecular abundances and therefore little star formation. Here, we\nexpand previous maps taken with the IRAM 30m telescope and present\nsquare-degree 12CO and 13CO (J=2-1) maps of the wind-driven \"Veil bubble'' that\nsurrounds the Trapezium cluster and its natal Orion molecular core (OMC).\nAlthough widespread and extended CO emission is largely absent from the Veil,\nwe show that several CO \"globules'' exist and are embedded in the\n[CII]158um-bright shell that confines the bubble. This includes the first\ndetection of quiescent CO at negative LSR velocities in Orion. Given the harsh\nUV irradiation conditions in this translucent material, the detection of CO\nglobules is surprising. These globules are small (R=7,100 AU), not massive\n(M=0.3M_Sun), and are moderately dense: n_ H=4x10^4 cm^-3 (median values). They\nare confined by the external pressure of the shell, P_ext/k~10^7 cm^-3 K, and\nare likely magnetically supported. They are either transient objects formed by\ninstabilities or have detached from pre-existing molecular structures, sculpted\nby the passing shock associated with the expanding shell and by UV radiation\nfrom the Trapezium. Some represent the first stages in the formation of small\npillars, others of isolated small globules. Although their masses do not\nsuggest they will form stars, one globule matches the position of a known YSO.\nThe lack of extended CO in the \"Veil shell'' demonstrates that feedback from\nmassive stars expels, agitates, and reprocesses most of the disrupted molecular\ncloud gas, thereby limiting the star-formation rate in the region. The presence\nof globules is a result of this feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 16:55:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 17:51:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

To realize this new paradigm, the passive IRSs have to be large,\nespecially for communication in far-field scenarios, so that they can\ncompensate for the large end-to-end path-loss, which is caused by the\nmultiplication of the individual path-losses of the transmitter-to-IRS and\nIRS-to-receiver channels. However, optimizing a large number of sub-wavelength\nIRS elements imposes a significant challenge for online transmission. To\naddress this issue, in this paper, we develop a physics-based model and a\nscalable optimization framework for large IRSs. The basic idea is to partition\nthe IRS unit cells into several subsets, referred to as tiles, model the impact\nof each tile on the wireless channel, and then optimize each tile in two\nstages, namely an offline design stage and an online optimization stage. For\nphysics-based modeling, we borrow concepts from the radar literature, model\neach tile as an anomalous reflector, and derive its impact on the wireless\nchannel for a given phase shift by solving the corresponding integral equations\nfor the electric and magnetic vector fields. In the offline design stage, the\nIRS unit cells of each tile are jointly designed for the support of different\ntransmission modes, where each transmission mode effectively corresponds to a\ngiven configuration of the phase shifts that the unit cells of the tile apply\nto an impinging electromagnetic wave. In the online optimization stage, the\nbest transmission mode of each tile is selected such that a desired\nquality-of-service (QoS) criterion is maximized. We show that the proposed\nmodeling and optimization framework can be used to efficiently optimize large\nIRSs comprising thousands of unit cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 17:13:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 2020 12:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

Using the thin shell formalism, this constraint sets a bound\non the minimal allowed radius of the time-like surface of the collapsing star\nat the bounce. It follows from this bound that the shell always bounces in an\nuntrapped region or precisely on a trapping horizon. This constraint is of\npurely kinematical origin as it descends from the continuity of the metric\nbetween the geometries describing the interior and exterior of the collapsing\nobject so that it is completely model-independent. The second part of this work\ninvestigates the conditions under which an effective extension of the\nOppenheimer-Snyder collapse can describe consistent bouncing black hole\nsolutions. We show that on top of the previous kinematical constraint, an\nadditional dynamical condition has to be satisfied in order for the model to\nadmit well-defined black-to-white hole solutions.

For a spectroscopic\nsurvey like SKA2, we find that neglecting lensing in the monopole, quadrupole\nand hexadecapole of the correlation function also induces an important shift of\nparameters. For ${\\Lambda}$CDM parameters, the shift is moderate, of the order\nof 0.6${\\sigma}$ or less. However, for a model-independent analysis, that\nmeasures the growth rate of structure in each redshift bin, neglecting lensing\nintroduces a shift of up to 2.3${\\sigma}$ at high redshift.

In particular, rotating and binary models will predict different\nyoung stellar populations, impacting the outputs of stellar population\nsynthesis (SPS) and the resulting interpretation of large massive star samples\nbased on commonly-used tools such as star count ratios. Here we compare the\nGeneva and BPASS evolutionary models, using an interpolated SPS scheme\nintroduced in our previous work and a novel Bayesian framework to present the\nfirst in-depth direct comparison of massive stellar populations produced from\nsingle, rotating, and binary non-rotating evolution models. We calculate both\nmodels' predicted values of star count ratios and compare the results to\nobservations of massive stars in Westerlund 1, $h + \\chi$ Persei, and both\nMagellanic Clouds. We also consider the limitations of both the observations\nand the models, and how to quantitatively include observational completeness\nlimits in SPS models. We demonstrate that the methods presented here, when\ncombined with robust stellar evolutionary models, offer a potential means of\nestimating the physical properties of massive stars in large stellar\npopulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Experiments by Hu\net al (2014). and Kaiser et al.

We provide a general framework for\nanalyzing this question for a large family of targets, called finite type\nconvex toric domains, which we prove generalizes the class of closed toric\nsymplectic 4-manifolds. When the target is of finite type, we prove that any\ninfinite staircase must have a unique accumulation point a_0, given as the\nsolution to an explicit quadratic equation.

We\nconjecture a complete answer to the question of existence of infinite\nstaircases, in terms of six families that are distinguished by the fact that\ntheir moment polygon is reflexive.

For the\nfirst, we use recursive families of almost toric fibrations to find symplectic\nembeddings. For the second tool, we find recursive families of convex lattice\npaths that provide obstructions to embeddings.

All raw time series within six hours of hospital admission were\nextracted for six vital signs (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood\npressure, heart rate, temperature, blood oxygen saturation, and respiratory\nrate). A deep interpolation network is proposed to learn from such irregular\nand sparse multivariate time series data to extract the fixed low-dimensional\nlatent patterns. We use k-means clustering algorithm to clusters the patient\nadmissions resulting into 7 clusters. Findings: Training, validation, and\ntesting cohorts had similar age (55-57 years), sex (55% female), and admission\nvital signs. Seven distinct clusters were identified. M Interpretation: In a\nheterogeneous cohort of hospitalized patients, a deep interpolation network\nextracted representations from vital sign data measured within six hours of\nhospital admission. This approach may have important implications for clinical\ndecision-support under time constraints and uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 18:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

Classical\ncompartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the\neffects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease. The\nimportance of social structure, such as the age dependence that proved\nessential in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, must be considered, and in addition,\nthe available data are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of\nuncertainty must be incorporated into the model from the beginning. In this\nwork we address these aspects, through an optimal control formulation of a\nsocially structured epidemic model in presence of uncertain data. After the\nintroduction of the optimal control problem, we formulate an instantaneous\napproximation of the control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled\ncompartmental models capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction.

Two reasons for the\nexcitement are the high $T_c$ of the system and the fact that the Majorana zero\nmodes (MZMs) inside the vortex cores live on the exposed surface rather than at\nthe interface of a heterostructure as in the proximitized topological\ninsulators. However, the recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy data have shown\nthat, contrary to the theoretical expectation, the MZM does not exist inside\nevery vortex core. Hence there are ``full'' vortices with MZMs and ``empty''\nvortices without MZMs. Moreover the fraction of ``empty'' vortices increase\nwith an increase in the magnetic field. We propose the possibility of two\ndistinct gapped states competing for the topological surface states in FeSeTe:\nthe TSC and half quantum anomalous Hall (hQAH). The latter is promoted by\nmagnetic field through the alignment of magnetic impurities such as Fe\ninterstitials. When hQAH takes over the topological surface state, the surface\nwill become transparent to scanning tunneling microscopy and the nature of the\nvortex in such region will appear identical to what is expected of the vortices\nin the bulk, i.e., empty. Unmistakable signature of the proposed mechanism for\nempty vortices will be the existance of chiral Majorana modes(CMM) at the\ndomain wall between a hQAH region and a TSC region. Such CMM should be\nobservable by observing local density of states along a line connecting an\nempty vortex to a nearby full vortex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 18:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

In such\nAI-advised decision making, humans and machines form a team, where the human is\nresponsible for making final decisions. But is the most accurate AI the best\nteammate? We argue \"No\" -- predictable performance may be worth a slight\nsacrifice in AI accuracy. Instead, we argue that AI systems should be trained\nin a human-centered manner, directly optimized for team performance. We study\nthis proposal for a specific type of human-AI teaming, where the human overseer\nchooses to either accept the AI recommendation or solve the task themselves.

One form of reduced model, the linear inverse\nmodel (LIM), has been widely used for regional climate predictability studies -\ntypically focusing more on tropical or mid-latitude studies. However, most LIM\nfitting techniques rely on point estimation techniques deriving from\nfluctuation-dissipation theory. In this methodological study we explore the use\nof Bayesian inference techniques for LIM parameter estimation of sea surface\ntemperature (SST), to quantify the skillful decadal predictability of Bayesian\nLIM models at high latitudes. We show that Bayesian methods, when compared to\ntraditional point estimation methods for LIM-type models, provide better\ncalibrated probabilistic skill, while simultaneously providing better point\nestimates due to the regularization effect of the prior distribution in\nhigh-dimensional problems. We compare the effect of several priors, as well as\nmaximum likelihood estimates, on (1) estimating parameter values on a perfect\nmodel experiment and (2) producing calibrated 1-year SST anomaly forecast\ndistributions using a pre-industrial control run of the Community Earth System\nModel (CESM). Finally, we employ a host of probabilistic skill metrics to\ndetermine the extent to which a LIM can forecast SST anomalies at high\nlatitudes. We find that the choice of prior distribution has an appreciable\nimpact on estimation outcomes, and priors that emphasize physically relevant\nproperties enhance the model's ability to capture variability of SST anomalies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 19:10:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

We examine\nthe optical Fe II and near-infrared Ca II triplet (CaT) emission strengths\nusing the photoionization code CLOUDY. Using an incident continuum for I Zw 1 -\na prototypical Type-1 narrow-line Seyfert galaxy, we can recover the line\nratios for the optical Fe II (i.e. R$_{\\rm{Fe II}}$) and the NIR CaT (i.e.\nR$_{\\rm{CaT}}$) in agreement to the observed estimates. Although, the pairs of\n(U,$\\rm{n_{H}}$) that reproduce the conforming line ratios, unfortunately, do\nnot relate to agreeable line EWs. We thus propose that the LIL region of the\nBLR cloud doesn't see the same continuum seen by a distant observer that is\nemanated from the accretion disk, rather it sees a filtered version of the\noriginal continuum. The assumption of the filtered continuum as the source of\nBLR irradiation recovers realistic EWs for LIL species.

However, the influence of nonlinear effects on the\nsynthetic frequency dimensions was studied only under significant restrictions.\nIn the present paper, we develop a generalized mean-field model for the optical\nfield envelope inside a single driven-dissipative resonator with quadratic and\ncubic nonlinearities, whose frequencies are coupled via an electro-optical\nresonant temporal modulation. The leading order equation takes the form of\ndriven Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a cosine potential. We numerically\ninvestigate the nonlinear dynamics in such microring resonator with a synthetic\nfrequency dimension in the regime where parametric frequency conversion occurs.\nIn the case of anomalous dispersion, we find that the presence of\nelectro-optical mode coupling confines and stabilizes the chaotic modulation\ninstability region. This leads to the appearance of a novel type of stable\ncoherent structures which emerge in the synthetic space with restored\ntranslational symmetry, in a region of parameters where conventionally only\nchaotic modulation instability states exist. This structure appears in the\ncenter of the synthetic band and, therefore, is referred to as Band Soliton.\nFinally, we extend our results to the case of multiple modulation frequencies\nwith controllable relative phases creating synthetic lattices with nontrivial\ngeometry.

Our work leverages the image synthesis\nfeature of GAN-based generative deep neural networks. The stress evaluation of\nmulti-segment interconnects, modeled by partial differential equations, can be\nviewed as time-varying 2D-images-to-image problem where the input is the\nmulti-segment interconnects topology with current densities and the output is\nthe EM stress distribution in those wire segments at the given aging time.\nBased on this observation, we train conditional GAN model using the images of\nmany self-generated multi-segment wires and wire current densities and aging\ntime (as conditions) against the COMSOL simulation results. Different\nhyperparameters of GAN were studied and compared. The proposed algorithm,\ncalled {\\it EM-GAN}, can quickly give accurate stress distribution of a general\nmulti-segment wire tree for a given aging time, which is important for\nfull-chip fast EM failure assessment.

The\nscanner design presented here aims to extend the reach of MRI by substantially\nreducing these limitations. Our goal is to shift the cost-benefit calculation\nfor MRI toward more frequent and varied use, including improved accessibility\nworldwide and point of care operation. Here, we describe a portable brain MRI\nscanner using a compact, lightweight permanent magnet, with a built-in readout\nfield gradient. Our low-field (80 mT) Halbach cylinder design of rare-earth\npermanent magnets results in a 122 kg magnet with minimal stray-field,\nrequiring neither cryogenics nor external power. The built-in magnetic field\ngradient reduces reliance on high-power gradient drivers, which not only lowers\noverall system power and cooling requirements, but also reduces acoustic noise.\nImperfections in the encoding fields are mitigated with a generalized iterative\nimage reconstruction technique, that uses prior characterization of the field\npatterns.

Of particular interest is the contribution from small\ntransverse momentum associated with the target bound state. In phenomenological\napplications, this contribution is often investigated using transverse momentum\nweighted integrals that sharply regulate the large transverse momentum\ncontribution, for example with Gaussian parametrizations. Since the result is a\nkind of hybrid of TMD and collinear (inclusive) treatments, it is important to\nestablish if and how the formalisms are related in applications to weighted\nintegral observables.

The solutions that have\nbeen found differ from each other substantially and illustrate the degeneracy\nof this issue. It is the aim of this work to explore the limitations that\ncurrent gas models have in linking the coma measurements to the surface. In\nparticular, we discuss the sensitivity of Rosetta's ROSINA/COPS, VIRTIS, and\nMIRO instruments to differentiate between vastly different spatial\ndistributions of the gas emission from the surface. We have applied a state of\nthe art 3D DSMC gas dynamics code to simulate the inner gas coma of different\nmodels that vary in the fraction of the surface that contains ice and in\ndifferent sizes of active patches. These different distributions result in jet\ninteractions that differ in their dynamical behaviour. We have found that\nROSINA/COPS measurements by themselves cannot detect the differences in our\nmodels. While ROSINA/COPS measurements are important to constrain the regional\ninhomogeneities of the gas emission, they can by themselves not determine the\nsurface emission distribution of the gas sources to a spatial accuracy of\nbetter than a few hundred metres (400 m). Any solutions fitting the ROSINA/COPS\nmeasurements is hence fundamentally degenerate, be it through a forward or\ninverse model. Only other instruments with complementary measurements can\npotentially lift this degeneracy as we show here for VIRTIS and MIRO. Finally,\nas a by-product, we have explored the effect of our activity distributions on\nlateral flow at the surface that may be responsible for some of the observed\naeolian features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 22:32:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

Non-pharmacological mitigation strategies such as social\ndistancing and the adoption of protective equipment aim precisely at reducing\ntransmission rates by reducing infectious contacts. To investigate the effects\nof mitigation strategies on the evolution of epidemics, nonlinear transmission\nrates that are influenced by the levels of infections, deaths or recoveries\nhave been included in many variants of the classical SIR model. This class of\nmodels is particularly relevant to the COVID-19 epidemic, in which the\npopulation behavior has been affected by the unprecedented abundance and rapid\ndistribution of global infection and death data through online platforms. This\nmanuscript revisits a SIR model in which the reduction of transmission rate is\ndue to knowledge of infections. Through a mean field approach that assumes\nindividuals behave like molecules in a well-mixed solution, one derives a\ntime-varying reproduction number that depends on infection information through\na negative feedback term that is equivalent to Holling type II functions in\necology and Michaelis-Menten functions in chemistry and molecular biology. A\nstep-by-step derivation of the model is provided, together with an overview of\nmethods for its qualitative analysis, showing that negative feedback\nstructurally reduces the peak of infections. At the same time, feedback may\nsubstantially extend the duration of an epidemic. Computational simulations\nagree with the analytical predictions, and further suggest that infection peak\nreduction persists even in the presence of information delays. If the\nmitigation strategy is linearly proportional to infections, a single parameter\nis added to the SIR model, making it useful to illustrate the effects of\ninfection-dependent social distancing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 00:13:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 07:59:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 01:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-24"}

The irradiation of the supergiant star\nessentially determines the flow properties of the stellar wind and the X-ray\nluminosity from the system. The results of three-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations of wind-fed X-ray binary systems reported in recent work reveal\nthat the ionizing feedback of the X-ray irradiation leads to the existence of\ntwo stable states with either a soft or a hard spectrum. Aims: We discuss the\nobserved radiation of Cygnus X-1 in the soft and hard state in the context of\nmass flow in the corona and disk, as predicted by the recent application of a\ncondensation model. Methods: The rates of gas condensation from the corona to\nthe disk for Cygnus X-1 are determined, and the spectra of the hard and soft\nradiation are computed. The theoretical results are compared with the MAXI\nobservations of Cygnus X-1 from 2009 to 2018.

Results: The theoretically\nderived values of photon counts and hardness are in approximate agreement with\nthe observed data in the HID. However, the scatter in the diagram is not\nreproduced. Improved agreement could result from variations in the viscosity\nassociated with clumping in the stellar wind and corresponding changes of the\nmagnetic fields in the disk. The observed dipping events in the hard state may\nalso contribute to the scatter and to a harder spectrum than predicted by the\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 02:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

Especially for\nautomatically generated models from real-world systems, family models might\neven be not constructible due to bad variable orders. In this paper we describe\na technique, called iterative variable reordering, that can enable the\nconstruction of large-scale family models. We exemplify feasibility of our\napproach by means of an aircraft velocity control system with redundancy\nmechanisms modeled in the input language of the probabilistic model checker\nPRISM. We show that standard reordering and dynamic reordering techniques fail\nto construct the family model due to memory and time constraints, respectively,\nwhile the new iterative approach succeeds to generate a symbolic family model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 04:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

Current clinical\npractice is to insert needles under image guidance or haptic feedback, although\nthat may involve reinsertions and adjustments since the needle and its\ninteraction with the tissue during insertion cannot be completely controlled.\n(Automated) needle steering could in theory improve the accuracy with which a\ntarget is reached and thus reduce surgical traumata especially for minimally\ninvasive procedures, e.g., brachytherapy or biopsy. Yet, flexible needles and\nneedle-tissue interaction are both complex and expensive to model and can often\nbe computed approximatively only. In this paper we propose to employ timed\ngames to navigate flexible needles with a bevel tip to reach a fixed target in\ntissue.

Many countries and research groups have launched or announced\nmobile apps to facilitate contact tracing by recording contacts between users\nwith some privacy considerations. Most of the focus has been on using random\ntokens, which are exchanged during encounters and stored locally on users'\nphones. Prior systems allow users to search over released tokens in order to\nlearn if they have recently been in the proximity of a user that has since been\ndiagnosed with the disease. However, prior approaches do not provide end-to-end\nprivacy in the collection and querying of tokens.

The challenge is to find the\noptimal balance between probing, i.e. exciting the system to understand it\nmore, and caution, i.e. selecting conservative controls based on current\nknowledge to achieve the control objective. Dynamic programming techniques can\nachieve this optimal trade-off. However, while dynamic programming performs\nwell with discrete state and time, it is not well-suited to problems with\ncontinuous time-frames or continuous or unbounded state spaces. Another\nlimitation is that multidimensional states often cause the dynamic programming\napproaches to be intractable. In this paper, we investigate whether\ncontinuous-time optimal control tools could help circumvent these caveats\nwhilst still achieving the probing-caution balance. We introduce a stylized\nproblem where the state is governed by one of two differential equations. It is\ninitially unknown which differential equation governs the system, so we must\nsimultaneously determine the true differential equation and control the system\nto the desired state. We show how this problem can be transformed to apply\noptimal control tools, and compare the performance of this approach to a\ndynamic programming approach. Our results suggest that the optimal control\nalgorithm rivals dynamic programming on small problems, achieving the right\nbalance between aggressive and smoothly varying controls. In contrast to\ndynamic programming, the optimal control approach remains tractable when\nseveral states are to be controlled simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 04:34:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

Indeed, machine\nlearning (ML) studies for ASD diagnosis using morphological brain networks\nderived from conventional T1-weighted MRI are very scarce. To fill this gap, we\nleverage crowdsourcing by organizing a Kaggle competition to build a pool of\nmachine learning pipelines for neurological disorder diagnosis with application\nto ASD diagnosis using cortical morphological networks derived from T1-weighted\nMRI.

The\nsupersymmetry in the matrix model corresponds to the target space supersymmetry\nand it is shown to be spontaneously broken by nonperturbative effect.\nFurthermore, in the matrix model we computed one-point functions of\nsingle-trace operators to all order of genus expansion in its double scaling\nlimit.

To\nunderstand the dynamics of the wave formation, we extend classic laminar\nboundary layer models for falling films to the jet wiping problem, including\nthe self-similar integral boundary layer (IBL) and the weighted integral\nboundary layer (WIBL) models.

However, typical MNR requires complex\nmemory access operations, i.e., both writing and reading via a controller\n(e.g., RNN) at every time step. Those frequent operations will dramatically\nincrease the network training time, resulting in the difficulty in being\ndeployed on industrial-scale recommender systems. In this paper, we present a\nnovel general Chunk framework to accelerate MNR significantly. Specifically,\nour framework divides proximal information units into chunks, and performs\nmemory access at certain time steps, whereby the number of memory operations\ncan be greatly reduced. We investigate two ways to implement effective\nchunking, i.e., PEriodic Chunk (PEC) and Time-Sensitive Chunk (TSC), to\npreserve and recover important recurrent signals in the sequence. Since\nchunk-accelerated MNR models take into account more proximal information units\nthan that from a single timestep, it can remove the influence of noise in the\nitem sequence to a large extent, and thus improve the stability of MNR. In this\nway, the proposed chunk mechanism can lead to not only faster training and\nprediction, but even slightly better results. The experimental results on three\nreal-world datasets (weishi, ml-10M and ml-latest) show that our chunk\nframework notably reduces the running time (e.g., with up to 7x for training &\n10x for inference on ml-latest) of MNR, and meantime achieves competitive\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 10:13:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2022 00:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

We show that due to a form of the\nParasite Chain that is different from the main Tangle it is possible to detect\ncertain types of malicious chains. We also show that although the attacker may\nchange the structure of the Parasite Chain to avoid detection, this is done so\nat a significant cost since the attack is rendered less efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 10:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

Traditional detection methods used highly computational machine\nlearning algorithms with intensive hardware set up, which are not suitable for\ninfield real-time apple detection due to their weight and power constraints. In\nthis study, a real-time embedded solution inspired from \"Edge AI\" is proposed\nfor apple detection with the implementation of YOLOv3-tiny algorithm on various\nembedded platforms such as Raspberry Pi 3 B+ in combination with Intel Movidius\nNeural Computing Stick (NCS), Nvidia's Jetson Nano and Jetson AGX Xavier. Data\nset for training were compiled using acquired images during field survey of\napple orchard situated in the north region of Italy, and images used for\ntesting were taken from widely used google data set by filtering out the images\ncontaining apples in different scenes to ensure the robustness of the\nalgorithm. The proposed study adapts YOLOv3-tiny architecture to detect small\nobjects.

Stochastic thermodynamics offers a framework to study\nnonequilibrium thermodynamics of small fluctuating systems, and quite recently,\nmicroscopic derivations and universal understanding of the trade-off relation\nbetween the current and dissipation have been put forward. Here we establish a\nuniversal framework clarifying how quantum coherence affects the trade-off\nbetween the current and dissipation: a proper use of coherence enhances the\nheat current without increasing dissipation, i.e. coherence can reduce\nfriction. If the amount of coherence is large enough, this friction becomes\nvirtually zero, realizing a superconducting-like ``dissipation-less'' heat\ncurrent. Since our framework clarifies a general relation among coherence,\nenergy flow, and dissipation, it can be applied to many branches of science. As\nan application to energy science, we construct a quantum heat engine cycle that\nexceeds the power-efficiency bound on classical engines, and effectively\nattains the Carnot efficiency with finite power in fast cycles.

In this study, we developed regression models for\nlarge-scale area-wide prediction of age in Norwegian forests. For model\ndevelopment we used more than 4800 plots of the Norwegian National Forest\nInventory (NFI) distributed over Norway between 58{\\deg} and 65{\\deg} northern\nlatitude in a 181,773 km2 study area. Predictor variables were based on\nairborne laser scanning (ALS), Sentinel-2, and existing public map data. We\nperformed model validation on an independent data set consisting of 63 spruce\nstands with known age. The best modelling strategy was to fit independent\nlinear regression models to each observed site index (SI) level and using a SI\nprediction map in the application of the models. The most important predictor\nvariable was an upper percentile of the ALS heights, and\nroot-mean-squared-errors (RMSE) ranged between 3 and 31 years (6% to 26%) for\nSI-specific models, and 21 years (25%) on average. Mean deviance (MD) ranged\nbetween -1 and 3 years. The models improved with increasing SI and the RMSE\nwere largest for low SI stands older than 100 years. Using a mapped SI, which\nis required for practical applications, RMSE and MD on plot-level ranged from\n19 to 56 years (29% to 53%), and 5 to 37 years (5% to 31%), respectively. For\nthe validation stands, the RMSE and MD were 12 (22%) and 2 years (3%). Tree\nheight estimated from airborne laser scanning and predicted site index were the\nmost important variables in the models describing age. Overall, we obtained\ngood results, especially for stands with high SI, that could be considered for\npractical applications but see considerable potential for improvements, if\nbetter SI maps were available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 11:21:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

Aimed at a systemic understanding of how\nonline consumers post negative reviews, using 1, 450, 000 negative reviews from\nJD.com, the largest B2C platform in China, the behavioral patterns from\ntemporal, perceptional and emotional perspectives are comprehensively explored\nin the present study. Massive consumers behind these reviews across four\nsectors in the most recent 10 years are further split into five levels to\nreveal group discriminations at a fine resolution. Circadian rhythms of\nnegative reviewing after making purchases were found, and the periodic\nintervals suggest stable habits in online consumption and that consumers tend\nto negatively review at the same hour of the purchase. Consumers from lower\nlevels express more intensive negative feelings, especially on product pricing\nand seller attitudes, while those from upper levels demonstrate a stronger\nmomentum of negative emotion. The value of negative reviews from higher-level\nconsumers is thus unexpectedly highlighted because of less emotionalization and\nless biased narration, while the longer-lasting characteristic of these\nconsumers' negative responses also stresses the need for more attention from\nsellers. Our results shed light on implementing distinguished proactive\nstrategies in different buyer groups to help mitigate the negative impact due\nto negative reviews.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 12:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

The categorical model of the\nquantum circuit description language Proto-Quipper-M by Rios and Selinger\n(2017) constitutes an example of such a fibration, which means that the\nlanguage can readily be integrated with dependent types.

However, clouds remain a key\nchallenge for characterisation: upcoming space telescopes (e.g. JWST, ARIEL)\nand ground-based high-resolution spectrographs (e.g. CRIRES+) will produce data\nrequiring detailed understanding of cloud formation and cloud effects. We aim\nto understand how the micro-porosity of cloud particles affects the cloud\nstructure, particle size, and material composition. We examine the\nspectroscopic effects of micro-porous particles, the particle size\ndistribution, and non-spherical cloud particles. We expanded our kinetic\nnon-equilibrium cloud formation model and use a grid of prescribed 1D\n(T_gas-p_gas) DRIFT-PHOENIX profiles. We applied the effective medium theory\nand the Mie theory to model the spectroscopic properties of cloud particles\nwith micro-porosity and a derived particle size distribution. We used a\nstatistical distribution of hollow spheres to represent the effects of\nnon-spherical cloud particles. Highly micro-porous cloud particles (90% vacuum)\nhave a larger surface area, enabling efficient bulk growth higher in the\natmosphere than for compact particles. Increases in single-scattering albedo\nand cross-sectional area for these mineral snowflakes cause the cloud deck to\nbecome optically thin only at a wavelength of ~100 ${\\rm \\mu m}$ instead of at\nthe ~20 ${\\rm \\mu m}$ for compact cloud particles. A significant enhancement in\nalbedo is also seen when cloud particles occur with a locally changing Gaussian\nsize distribution. Non-spherical particles increase the opacity of silicate\nspectral features, which further increases the wavelength at which the clouds\nbecome optically thin. JWST MIRI will be sensitive to signatures of\nmicro-porous and non-spherical cloud particles based on the wavelength at which\nclouds are optically thin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 13:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

How this environmental impact changes over time\nis an important constraint on disk evolution and external photoevaporation\nmodels. We characterize the dust emission from 179 disks in the core of the\nyoung (0.5 Myr) NGC 2024 cluster. By studying how the disk mass varies within\nthe cluster, and comparing these disks to those in other regions, we aim to\ndetermine how external photoevaporation influences disk properties over time.\nUsing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, a 2.9' x 2.9' mosaic\ncentered on NGC 2024 FIR 3 was observed at 225 GHz with a resolution of 0.25'',\nor ~100 AU. The imaged region contains 179 disks identified at IR wavelengths,\nseven new disk candidates, and several protostars. The overall detection rate\nof disks is $32 \\pm 4\\%$. Few of the disks are resolved, with the exception of\na giant (R = 300 AU) transition disk. Serendipitously, we observe a millimeter\nflare from an X-ray bright young stellar object (YSO), and resolve continuum\nemission from a Class 0 YSO in the FIR 3 core. Two distinct disk populations\nare present: a more massive one in the east, along the dense molecular ridge\nhosting the FIR 1-5 YSOs, with a detection rate of $45 \\pm 7\\%$. In the western\npopulation, towards IRS 1, only $15 \\pm 4\\%$ of disks are detected. NGC 2024\nhosts two distinct disk populations. Disks along the dense molecular ridge are\nyoung (0.2 - 0.5 Myr) and partly shielded from the far ultraviolet radiation of\nIRS 2b; their masses are similar to isolated 1 - 3 Myr old SFRs. The western\npopulation is older and at lower extinctions, and may be affected by external\nphotoevaporation from both IRS 1 and IRS 2b. However, it is possible these\ndisks had lower masses to begin with.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 14:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

Results: We found that the gas temperature may\nsignificantly exceed that of dust in the outer regions of young disks thanks to\nadditional compressional heating caused by the infalling envelope material in\nthe early stages of disk evolution and slow collisional exchange of energy\nbetween gas and dust in low-density disk regions.

However, automatically segmenting the whole\nfetal head in US volumes still pends as an emerging and unsolved problem. The\nchallenges that automated solutions need to tackle include the poor image\nquality, boundary ambiguity, long-span occlusion, and the appearance\nvariability across different fetal poses and gestational ages. In this paper,\nwe propose the first fully-automated solution to segment the whole fetal head\nin US volumes.\n  Methods: The segmentation task is firstly formulated as an end-to-end\nvolumetric mapping under an encoder-decoder deep architecture. We then combine\nthe segmentor with a proposed hybrid attention scheme (HAS) to select\ndiscriminative features and suppress the non-informative volumetric features in\na composite and hierarchical way. With little computation overhead, HAS proves\nto be effective in addressing boundary ambiguity and deficiency.

A\nrecurrent assumption is the stationarity of the reward function, which is\nrather unrealistic in most of the real-world applications. In the music\nrecommendation scenario for instance, people's music taste can abruptly change\nduring certain events, such as Halloween or Christmas, and revert to the\nprevious music taste soon after.\n  We would therefore need an algorithm which can promptly react to these\nchanges. Moreover, we would like to leverage already observed rewards collected\nduring different stationary periods which can potentially reoccur, without the\nneed of restarting the learning process from scratch. A growing literature has\naddressed the problem of reward's non-stationarity, providing algorithms that\ncould quickly adapt to the changing environment. However, up to our knowledge,\nthere is no algorithm which deals with seasonal changes of the reward function.\nHere we present a contextual bandit algorithm which detects and adapts to\nabrupt changes of the reward function and leverages previous estimations\nwhenever the environment falls back to a previously observed state. We show\nthat the proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art algorithms for\nnon-stationary environments.

However, it is incredibly\nchallenging because it is an extremely complicated task that involves visual\nperception and high-level reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose the\nneural-symbolic learning (NSL) framework that performs human-like learning by\nunifying deep neural learning and symbolic logical reasoning for the spinal\nmedical report generation. Generally speaking, the NSL framework firstly\nemploys deep neural learning to imitate human visual perception for detecting\nabnormalities of target spinal structures. Concretely, we design an adversarial\ngraph network that interpolates a symbolic graph reasoning module into a\ngenerative adversarial network through embedding prior domain knowledge,\nachieving semantic segmentation of spinal structures with high complexity and\nvariability. NSL secondly conducts human-like symbolic logical reasoning that\nrealizes unsupervised causal effect analysis of detected entities of\nabnormalities through meta-interpretive learning. NSL finally fills these\ndiscoveries of target diseases into a unified template, successfully achieving\na comprehensive medical report generation. When it employed in a real-world\nclinical dataset, a series of empirical studies demonstrate its capacity on\nspinal medical report generation as well as show that our algorithm remarkably\nexceeds existing methods in the detection of spinal structures. These indicate\nits potential as a clinical tool that contributes to computer-aided diagnosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 15:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

The\nfollowing question arises: What is the impact of these forces on the ensemble\nof thousand particles in continuous media? The aim of this work is to find\nanalytical expression of the radiation force and potential densities creating\nfrom laser pulse propagating in dielectric media. This allows us to find an\neffective averaged longitudinal real force at the level of the laser pulse\nspot. The obtained force is proportional to initial pulse energy and inversely\nproportional to its time duration. In the femtosecond region the force becomes\nstrong enough to confine the neutral particles into the pulse envelope and\ntranslate them with group velocity. In silica for example, the longitudinal\nforce of a femtosecond pulse is significantly greater than the molecular\nforces. Thus, the fine ablation in silica with short pulses may be due to this\nlongitudinal force, which breaks down the molecular bonds. Additionally, after\nconfinement into the pulse envelope, the moving particles produce new linear\nand nonlinear effects. The dipole interaction with the electromagnetic field of\nthe particles captured into the pulse generate at carrier-to-envelope\nfrequency, instead of at the carrying ones.

Their aim\nwas to look for the spin and exchange or virtual annihilation effects predicted\nby the Moller and Bhabha formulae. Their experiments confirmed these effects,\nbut the measured cross-sections at 0.61 MeV were significantly smaller than\ntheir predicted values. The authors remarked that these deviations were\n`presumably due to multiple scattering'. However, careful reading of the\nunpublished theses of Page (1950) and Ashkin (1952), Page's letter (1951) and\nthe APW paper reveals no credible evidence of multiple scattering at 0.61 MeV;\nif anything, the evidence rules against multiple scattering.

This factor is comprised of certain physical components of the fluid\nsuch as irregularity in energy density, locally pressure anisotropy and\nelectric charge (arranged in a specific way). In addition, the effects of extra\ncurvature terms of modified gravity are examined by making the relations among\nthe complexity factor, Weyl scalar and Tolman mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 12:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

Using seismic records from\nstations in China and Italy, we show that seismic noise above 1 Hz was\nprimarily generated by the local transportation systems. The lockdown of the\ncities and the imposition of travel restrictions led to a ~4-12 dB energy\ndecrease in seismic noise in mainland China. Data also show that different\nChinese cities experienced distinct periods of diminished cultural noise,\nrelated to differences in local response to the epidemic. In contrast, there\nwas only ~1-6 dB energy decrease of seismic noise in Italy, after the country\nwas put under a lockdown.

Such an evaluation requires error propagation all the way from\nparticle strikes on low-level state up to the program output. Existing\napproaches that rely on low-level simulations with fault injection cannot\nevaluate full applications because of their slow speeds, while\napplication-level accelerated fault testing in accelerated particle beams is\noften impractical. We present a new two-level methodology for application\nresilience evaluation that overcomes these challenges. The proposed approach\ndecomposes application failure rate estimation into (1) identifying how\nparticle strikes in low-level unprotected state manifest at the\narchitecture-level, and (2) measuring how such architecture-level\nmanifestations propagate to the program output. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this approach on GPU architectures.

This powerful and flexible mathematical framework\nis currently being used to track the human joint dynamics by first imposing\nbone rigidity constraints in order to synthetize the spatio-temporal joint\ndeformations later. However, since no closed-form exists, then a\ncomputationally expensive integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\nis required to perform image registration using this framework. To tackle this\nproblem, the exponential map for solving these ODEs is computed using the\nscaling and squaring method in the literature. In this paper, we propose an\nalgorithm using a matrix diagonalization based method for smooth interpolation\nof homogeneous polyrigid transformations of human joints during motion. The use\nof this alternative computational approach to integrate ODEs is well motivated\nby the fact that bone rigid transformations satisfy the mechanical constraints\nof human joint motion, which provide conditions that guarantee the\ndiagonalizability of local bone transformations and consequently of the\nresulting joint transformations. In a comparison with the scaling and squaring\nmethod, we discuss the usefulness of the matrix eigendecomposition technique\nwhich reduces significantly the computational burden associated with the\ncomputation of matrix exponential over a dense regular grid. Finally, we have\napplied the method to enhance the temporal resolution of dynamic MRI sequences\nof the ankle joint. To conclude, numerical experiments show that the\neigendecomposition method is more capable of balancing the trade-off between\naccuracy, computation time, and memory requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 14:30:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 12:20:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 18:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

Though, such option doesn't make things easier since the task of\nthe first principles finding is not less complicated versus to the original\nproblem. The alternative path for understanding the world around us is to\ninterpret the fundamental limit values as a factor determining the physical\nlaws structure. A significant part of this path has already been completed. It\nwas possible to show that the quantum mechanics can be built on the basis of\nthe existence of the minimum quantum action, while the special theory of\nrelativity - on the maximum speed c. Furthermore, from rather recently it\nbecame clear that a similar approach could be implemented in general relativity\nbut in this case it can be constructed by postulating the existence of a\nminimum lengths. The goal of this review is to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nlimit values as a tool for describing the physics of the Planck scale.\nMoreover, by virtue of their universality, the limit values allow us to\nestablish relationships between, on first glance, distant fields of physics. We\nwill consider the simplest consequences of the inclusion of gravitational\neffects in quantum reality.
