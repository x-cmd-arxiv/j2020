Due to security concerns arising from aggregating\nraw data at a single server, several real world deployments in industry have\nembraced the LDP model. However, systems based on the LDP model tend to have\npoor utility - \"a gap\" in the utility achieved as compared to systems based on\nthe SDP model.\n  In this work, we survey and synthesize emerging directions of research at the\nintersection of differential privacy and cryptography. First, we survey\nsolutions that combine cryptographic primitives like secure computation and\nanonymous communication with differential privacy to give alternatives to the\nLDP model that avoid a trusted server as in SDP but close the gap in accuracy.\nThese primitives introduce performance bottlenecks and necessitate efficient\nalternatives. Second, we synthesize work in an area we call \"DP-Cryptography\" -\ncryptographic primitives that are allowed to leak differentially private\noutputs. These primitives have orders of magnitude better performance than\nstandard cryptographic primitives. DP-cryptographic primitives are perfectly\nsuited for implementing alternatives to LDP, but are also applicable to\nscenarios where standard cryptographic primitives do not have practical\nimplementations. Through this unique lens of research taxonomy, we survey\nongoing research in these directions while also providing novel directions for\nfuture research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2020 16:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

Due to the presence of a strong adversary, first, we point out that\ntraditional frequency-hopping does not help since unused frequency bands may\nnot be available, and moreover, the victim's transition between the frequency\nbands would be detected by the full-duplex adversary. Identifying these\nchallenges, we propose a new cooperative mitigation strategy, referred to as\nthe Semi-Coherent Fast-Forward Full-Duplex (SC-FFFD) relaying technique,\nwherein the victim node, upon switching to a new frequency band, seeks the\nassistance of its incumbent user, which is also a full-duplex radio, to\ninstantaneously forward its messages to the destination using a portion of\ntheir powers. Meanwhile, the two nodes cooperatively use their residual powers\non the jammed frequency band so as to engage the adversary to continue\nexecuting the jamming attack on the same band. Using on-off keying (OOK) and\nphase-shift-keying (PSK) as the modulation schemes at the victim and the helper\nnode, respectively, we derive upper bounds on the probability of error of\njointly decoding the information symbols of the two nodes, and subsequently\nderive analytical solutions to arrive at the power-splitting factor between the\ntwo frequency bands to minimize the error of both the nodes.

Our ability to mathematically describe\ntopology, combined with our access to precision tracking and manipulation\napproaches, has triggered a fresh appreciation of topological ramifications,\nspecifically in mediating key functions in biological systems spanning orders\nof magnitude in length and time scales. Microbial ecosystems, a frequently\nencountered example of living matter, offer a rich test bed where the role of\ntopological defects and their mechanics can be explored in the context of\nmicrobial composition, structure and functions. Emergent processes, triggered\nby anisotropy and activity characteristic of such structured,\nout-of-equilibrium systems, underpin fundamental properties in microbial\nsystems.

Topology and its\nfunctional manifestations - a crucial and well-timed topic - offer a rich\nopportunity for both experimentalists and theoreticians willing to take up an\nexciting journey across scales and disciplines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2020 16:39:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

As a result, some algorithmic solutions may suffer from lack\nof memory bandwidth or computational resources and fail to achieve the expected\nperformance due to hardware constraints. Thus, the system designer and the\nmicro-architect need to understand at early development stages the impact of\ntheir high-level decisions (e.g., the architecture of the CNN and the amount of\nbits used to represent its parameters) on the final product (e.g., the expected\npower saving, area, and accuracy).

High-excitation lines, such as He II 468.6 nm, were\nextraordinarily weak, even when the system was actively accreting. This\nstrongly suggests the absence of an accretion shock, placing Tau 4 in the\nbombardment regime predicted for AM Herculis systems with low accretion rates.\nIn both the high-state and low-state spectra, Zeeman absorption features from\nthe white dwarf's photosphere are present and reveal a surface-averaged field\nstrength of $15\\pm2$ MG. Remarkably, the high-state spectra also show\nZeeman-split emission lines produced in a region with a field strength of\n$12\\pm1$ MG. Zeeman emission has not been previously reported in an AM Herculis\nsystem, and we propose that the phenomenon is caused by a temperature inversion\nin the WD's atmosphere near the accretion region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2020 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

On each round, a mechanism\nfirst assigns an allocation each to a set of agents and charges them a price;\nat the end of the round, the agents provide (stochastic) feedback to the\nmechanism for the allocation they received. This setting is motivated by\napplications in cloud markets and online advertising where an agent may know\nher value for an allocation only after experiencing it. Therefore, the\nmechanism needs to explore different allocations for each agent so that it can\nlearn their values, while simultaneously attempting to find the socially\noptimal set of allocations. Our focus is on truthful and individually rational\nmechanisms which imitate the classical VCG mechanism in the long run. To that\nend, we first define three notions of regret for the welfare, the individual\nutilities of each agent and that of the mechanism.

Our framework also provides\nflexibility to control the pricing scheme so as to trade-off between the agent\nand seller regrets. Next, we define asymptotic variants for the truthfulness\nand individual rationality requirements and provide asymptotic rates to\nquantify the degree to which both properties are satisfied by the proposed\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2020 18:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:23:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 22:03:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 23 Jan 2022 20:46:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

A force platform recorded torque actuated by the feet, and normalized sway\npath length (SPL) was computed as a construct for postural performance during\neach period. SPL values indicated improvement in postural performance over the\ntrial periods. Significant variation in absolute power values (ASP) was found\nin assessing postural adaptation: an increase in theta band ASP in the\nfrontal-central region for closed-eyes trials, an increase in theta and beta\nband ASP in the parietal region for open-eyes trials. In habituation, no\nsignificant variations in ASP were observed during closed-eyes trials, whereas\nan increase in theta, alpha, and beta band ASP was observed with open eyes.\nFurthermore, open-eyed trials generally yielded a greater number of significant\nASP differences across all bands during both adaptation and habituation,\nsuggesting that following cortical activity during postural perturbation may be\nup-regulated with the availability of visual feedback.

The resources of the nodes and devices in\nthe SCC have certain constraints that may not allow the devices and nodes to\ncooperate to save their resources such as memory, energy, and buffer, or simply\nmaximize their performance. Thus, to stimulate the nodes to avoid selfish\nbehavior, SSC needs a novel and well-organized solution to motivate nodes for\ncooperation. This article aims to resolve the issue of selfish behaviors in SCC\nand to encourage the nodes for cooperation. A novel mechanism Socially Omitting\nSelfishness (SOS) has been proposed to manage/eradicate selfishness using a\nsocially-oriented election process. The election process elects different heads\nbased on weight and cooperation (using VCG model). The election of heads and\nincentive mechanism encourages the nodes to show participation and behave as\nhighly cooperative members of the community. Furthermore, an extended version\nof the Dempster-Shafer model has been used to discourage the selfish behavior\nof the participating nodes in the SOS scheme. It uses different monitoring and\ngateway nodes to efficiently employ the proposed scheme. A mathematical model\nhas been developed for the aforementioned aspects and simulated through the NS2\nsimulation environment to analyze the performance of SOS. The results of the\nproposed scheme outperform the contemporary schemes in terms of average\ndelivery delay, packet delivery ratio, throughput, and average energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2020 20:01:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

Attacks have become a national/global\nthreat as they have targeted private and public, as well as government sectors\nover the years. This is a growing issue and organisations are taking steps to\nreduce, detect and prevent threats. To do this they need to use systems that\nare equipped with the capabilities to do either of those steps and develop them\nfor the type of networks they use, for instance wired or wireless. One of these\nsystems are Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which can be used as the first\ndefence mechanism or a secondary defence mechanism of a threat or an attack.\nThere are different types of attacks that can occur in a network, such as\nDenial of service (DoS)/Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), port scanning,\nmalware or ransomware and so forth that IDSs have a capability of detecting.\nAssisting in the mitigation of such attacks, there are also Intrusion\nPrevention Systems (IPS) whose role has a different purpose than that of IDSs.\nUnlike IDSs they not only detect threats but prevent them from disrupting the\nnetwork, IPSs can be used in conjunction with IDSs to double the defences. This\npaper provides an overview of IDS and their classifications and IPS. It will\ndetail typical benefits and limitations to using IDSs, IPSs and the hybrids\n(such as Intrusions Detection Prevention Systems (IDPSs and more)) which will\nbe discussed further.

There is an urgent demand to produce high-quality,\nhigh-performance buckypaper at an industrial scale. Raman spectroscopy provides\ndetailed nanostructure information within seconds, and the obtained spectra can\nbe decomposed into multiple effects associated with diverse quality\ncharacteristics of buckypaper. However, the decomposed effects are\nhigh-dimensional, and a systematic quantification method for buckypaper quality\nassessment has been lacking. In this paper, we propose a real-time data-driven\nquality assessment method, which fills in the blank of quantifying the quality\nfor continuous manufacturing processes of CNT buckypaper. The composite indices\nderived from the proposed method are developed by analyzing in-line Raman\nspectroscopy sensing data. Weighted cross-correlation and maximum margin\nclustering are used to fuse the fixed effects into an inconsistency index to\nmonitor the long-term mean shift of the process and to fuse the normal effects\ninto a uniformity index to monitor the within-sample normality. Those\nindividual quality indices are then combined into a composite index to reflect\nthe overall quality of buckypaper. A case study indicates that our proposed\napproach can determine the quality rank for ten samples, and can provide\nquantitative quality indices for single-walled carbon nanotube buckypaper after\nacid processing or functionalization. The quality assessment results are\nconsistent with evaluations from the experienced engineers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2020 21:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

We\nparticularly consider a multi-objective NAS formulation, with network accuracy\nand network complexity as two objectives, as understanding the trade-off\nbetween these two objectives is arguably the most interesting aspect of NAS.\nThe proposed LS algorithm is compared with RS and two evolutionary algorithms\n(EAs), as these are often heralded as being ideal for multi-objective\noptimization. To promote reproducibility, we create and release two benchmark\ndatasets, named MacroNAS-C10 and MacroNAS-C100, containing 200K saved network\nevaluations for two established image classification tasks, CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100. Our benchmarks are designed to be complementary to existing\nbenchmarks, especially in that they are better suited for multi-objective\nsearch. We additionally consider a version of the problem with a much larger\narchitecture space. While we find and show that the considered algorithms\nexplore the search space in fundamentally different ways, we also find that LS\nsubstantially outperforms RS and even performs nearly as good as\nstate-of-the-art EAs. We believe that this provides strong evidence that LS is\ntruly a competitive baseline for NAS against which new NAS algorithms should be\nbenchmarked.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 00:08:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 12:44:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 11:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

However, sensitive information can be derived from movement\npatterns, thus protecting the privacy of mobile users is a major concern. Users\nmay only be willing to disclose their locations when some condition is met, for\ninstance in proximity of a disaster area or an event of interest. Currently,\nsuch functionality can be achieved using searchable encryption. Such\ncryptographic primitives provide provable guarantees for privacy, and allow\ndecryption only when the location satisfies some predicate. Nevertheless, they\nrely on expensive pairing-based cryptography (PBC), of which direct application\nto the domain of location updates leads to impractical solutions. We propose\nsecure and efficient techniques for private processing of location updates that\ncomplement the use of PBC and lead to significant gains in performance by\nreducing the amount of required pairing operations.

The observed\ndata has the following typical characteristics: it is high-dimensional,\ncompositional (lying in a simplex) and even would be leptokurtic and highly\nskewed due to the existence of overly abundant taxa, which makes the\nconventional correlation analysis infeasible to study the co-occurrence and\nco-exclusion relationship between microbial taxa. In this article, we address\nthe challenges of covariance estimation for this kind of data. Assuming the\nbasis covariance matrix lying in a well-recognized class of sparse covariance\nmatrices, we adopt a proxy matrix known as centered log-ratio covariance matrix\nin the literature, which is approximately indistinguishable from the real basis\ncovariance matrix as the dimensionality tends to infinity. We construct a\nMedian-of-Means (MOM) estimator for the centered log-ratio covariance matrix\nand propose a thresholding procedure that is adaptive to the variability of\nindividual entries. By imposing a much weaker finite fourth moment condition\ncompared with the sub-Gaussianity condition in the literature, we derive the\noptimal rate of convergence under the spectral norm. In addition, we also\nprovide theoretical guarantee on support recovery. The adaptive thresholding\nprocedure of the MOM estimator is easy to implement and gains robustness when\noutliers or heavy-tailedness exist. Thorough simulation studies are conducted\nto show the advantages of the proposed procedure over some state-of-the-arts\nmethods.

In order to deploy DNN algorithms efficiently on\nedge or mobile devices, a series of DNN compression algorithms have been\nexplored, including factorization methods. Factorization methods approximate\nthe weight matrix of a DNN layer with the multiplication of two or multiple\nlow-rank matrices. However, it is hard to measure the ranks of DNN layers\nduring the training process. Previous works mainly induce low-rank through\nimplicit approximations or via costly singular value decomposition (SVD)\nprocess on every training step. The former approach usually induces a high\naccuracy loss while the latter has a low efficiency. In this work, we propose\nSVD training, the first method to explicitly achieve low-rank DNNs during\ntraining without applying SVD on every step. SVD training first decomposes each\nlayer into the form of its full-rank SVD, then performs training directly on\nthe decomposed weights. We add orthogonality regularization to the singular\nvectors, which ensure the valid form of SVD and avoid gradient\nvanishing/exploding. Low-rank is encouraged by applying sparsity-inducing\nregularizers on the singular values of each layer. Singular value pruning is\napplied at the end to explicitly reach a low-rank model. We empirically show\nthat SVD training can significantly reduce the rank of DNN layers and achieve\nhigher reduction on computation load under the same accuracy, comparing to not\nonly previous factorization methods but also state-of-the-art filter pruning\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 02:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

We\ndemonstrate the power of this perspective to develop cognitive AI systems with\nhumanlike common sense by showing how to observe and apply FPICU with little\ntraining data to solve a wide range of challenging tasks, including tool use,\nplanning, utility inference, and social learning.

It consists of two sub-arrays, one white and\none black of half of the size of the white. Both of them are conceptually\npartitioned into segments of different ranks with the sizes grow in geometric\nsequence. The layout of BWA allows easy calculation of the meta-data about the\nsegments, which are used extensively in the algorithms for the basic operations\nof the dynamic sets. The insertion of a sequence of unordered numbers into BWA\ntakes amortized time logarithmic to the length of the sequence. It is also\nproven that when the searched or deleted value is present in the BWA, the\nasymptotic amortized cost for the operations is O(log(n)); otherwise, the time\nwill fall somewhere between O(log(n)) and O(log^2(n)). It is shown that the\nstate variable total, which records the number of values in the BWA captures\nthe dynamics of state transition of BWA. This fact is exploited to produce\nconcise, easy- to-understand, and efficient coding for the operations. As it\nuses arrays as the underlying structure for dynamic set, a BWA need neither the\nspace to store the pointers referencing other data nodes nor the time to chase\nthe pointers as with any linked data structures. A C++ implementation of the\nBWA is completed. The performance data were gathered and plotted, which\nconfirmed the theoretic analysis.

To achieve\npoint cloud classification, previous studies proposed point cloud deep learning\nmodels that can directly process raw point clouds based on PointNet-like\narchitectures. And some recent works proposed graph convolution neural network\nbased on the inherent topology of point clouds. However, the above point cloud\ndeep learning models only pay attention to exploring local geometric\nstructures, yet ignore global contextual relationships among all points. In\nthis paper, we present a graph attention convolution neural network (GACNN)\nthat can be directly applied to the classification of unstructured 3D point\nclouds obtained by airborne LiDAR. Specifically, we first introduce a graph\nattention convolution module that incorporates global contextual information\nand local structural features.

The proposed GDC\nscheme achieves dimming control by simultaneously adjusting the intensity of\ntransmitted symbols and the number of active elements in a space-time matrix.\nBoth the indices of the active elements in each space-time matrix and the\nmodulated constellation symbols are used to carry information. Since\nillumination is deemed as the prior task of VLC, an incremental algorithm for\nindex mapping is proposed for achieving target optical power and uniform\nillumination. Next, GDC having the optimal activation pattern is investigated\nto further improve the bit-error rate (BER) performance. In particular, the BER\nperformance of GDC is analyzed using the union bound technique. Based on the\nanalytical BER bound, the optimal activation pattern of GDC scheme with the\nminimum BER criterion (GDC-MBER) is obtained by exhaustively searching all\nconditional pairwise error probabilities. However, since GDC-MBER requires high\nsearch complexity, two low-complexity GDC schemes having the maximum free\ndistance criterion (GDCMFD) are proposed. The first GDC-MFD scheme, coined as\nGDC-MFD1, reduces the computational complexity by deriving a lower bound of the\nfree distance based on Rayleigh-Ritz theorem. Based on the time-invariance\ncharacteristics of the VLC channel, GDC-MFD2 is proposed to further reduce the\nrequired computation efforts. Simulation and numerical results show that\nGDC-MBER, GDC-MFD1 and GDC-MFD2 have similar BER performance, and they can\nachieve 2 dB performance gains over conventional hybrid dimming control scheme\nand 7 dB performance gains over digital dimming control schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 05:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Here, we present operando direct\nobservation of spin states in the cells using electron spin resonance (ESR)\nspectroscopy in order to investigate the operation and deterioration mechanisms\nfrom a microscopic viewpoint. By simultaneous measurements of solar-cell and\nESR characteristics of the same cell, the spin states in the hole-transport\nmaterial (HTM) spiro-OMeTAD are demonstrated to be changed at the molecular\nlevel, which varies the device performance under device operation. These\nvariations are ascribed to the change of hole transport by charge-carrier\nscatterings and filling of deep trapping levels in the HTM, and to interfacial\nelectric dipole layers formed at the HTM interfaces. In addition, reverse\nelectron transfer from TiO2 layer to the HTM layer is directly demonstrated at\nthe molecular level under ultraviolet light irradiation, which causes the\ndecrease in the HTM doping effect. Thus, conducting such operando microscopic\ninvestigation on the internal states in the cells would be useful to obtain a\nnew further guideline for improving the device performance and durability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 05:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

We propose that the additional greenhouse forcing of CO2-H2\ncollision-induced absorption is capable of bringing the surface temperature\nabove freezing and can put early Mars into a limit-cycling regime. Limit cycles\noccur when insolation is low and CO2 outgassing rates are unable to balance\nwith the rapid drawdown of CO2 during warm weathering periods. Planets in this\nregime will alternate between global glaciation and transient warm climate\nphases. This mechanism is capable of explaining the geomorphological evidence\nfor transient warm periods in the martian record. Previous work has shown that\ncollision-induced absorption of CO2-H2 was capable of deglaciating early Mars,\nbut only with high H2 outgassing rates (greater than ~600 Tmol/yr) and at high\nsurface pressures (between 3 to 4 bars). We used new theoretically derived\ncollision-induced absorption coefficients for CO2-H2 to reevaluate the climate\nlimit cycling hypothesis for early Mars. Using the new and stronger absorption\ncoefficients in our 1-dimensional radiative convective model as well as our\nenergy balance model, we find that limit cycling can occur with an H2\noutgassing rate as low as ~300 Tmol/yr at surface pressures below 3 bars. Our\nresults agree more closely with paleoparameters for early martian surface\npressure and hydrogen abundance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 06:11:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 04:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

One of\nthe main sources of difficulty is that a very limited amount of daily COVID-19\ncase data is available, and with few exceptions, the majority of countries are\ncurrently in the \"exponential spread stage,\" and thus there is scarce\ninformation available which would enable one to predict the phase transition\nbetween spread and containment.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predicting the spread of\nCOVID-19 based on dictionary learning and online nonnegative matrix\nfactorization (online NMF). The key idea is to learn dictionary patterns of\nshort evolution instances of the new daily cases in multiple countries at the\nsame time, so that their latent correlation structures are captured in the\ndictionary patterns. We first learn such patterns by minibatch learning from\nthe entire time-series and then further adapt them to the time-series by online\nNMF. As we progressively adapt and improve the learned dictionary patterns to\nthe more recent observations, we also use them to make one-step predictions by\nthe partial fitting. Lastly, by recursively applying the one-step predictions,\nwe can extrapolate our predictions into the near future. Our prediction results\ncan be directly attributed to the learned dictionary patterns due to their\ninterpretability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 08:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

A well-known limitation of process\nsimulation is that the accuracy of the simulation results is limited by the\nfaithfulness of the process model and simulation parameters given as input to\nthe simulator. To tackle this limitation, several authors have proposed to\ndiscover simulation models from process execution logs so that the resulting\nsimulation models more closely match reality. Existing techniques in this field\nassume that each resource in the process performs one task at a time. In\nreality, however, resources may engage in multitasking behavior. Traditional\nsimulation approaches do not handle multitasking. Instead, they rely on a\nresource allocation approach wherein a task instance is only assigned to a\nresource when the resource is free. This inability to handle multitasking leads\nto an overestimation of execution times. This paper proposes an approach to\ndiscover multitasking in business process execution logs and to generate a\nsimulation model that takes into account the discovered multitasking behavior.\nThe key idea is to adjust the processing times of tasks in such a way that\nexecuting the multitasked tasks sequentially with the adjusted times is\nequivalent to executing them concurrently with the original processing times.\nThe proposed approach is evaluated using a real-life dataset and synthetic\ndatasets with different levels of multitasking. The results show that, in the\npresence of multitasking, the approach improves the accuracy of simulation\nmodels discovered from execution logs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 09:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

Despite the evolution of deep-learning-based image and text\nprocessing systems, multi-modal matching remains a challenging problem. In this\nwork, we consider the problem of accurate image-text matching for the task of\nmulti-modal large-scale information retrieval. State-of-the-art results in\nimage-text matching are achieved by inter-playing image and text features from\nthe two different processing pipelines, usually using mutual attention\nmechanisms. However, this invalidates any chance to extract separate visual and\ntextual features needed for later indexing steps in large-scale retrieval\nsystems. In this regard, we introduce the Transformer Encoder Reasoning Network\n(TERN), an architecture built upon one of the modern relationship-aware\nself-attentive architectures, the Transformer Encoder (TE). This architecture\nis able to separately reason on the two different modalities and to enforce a\nfinal common abstract concept space by sharing the weights of the deeper\ntransformer layers. Thanks to this design, the implemented network is able to\nproduce compact and very rich visual and textual features available for the\nsuccessive indexing step.

Reliability\nof electrical devices such as coils, motors, relays, solenoids and transformers\nis heavily dependent on the Electrical Insulation System (EIS). Accelerated\naging methods are used to rapidly simulate the conditions in real life, which\nis typically years (20,000 hours) depending on the operating conditions. The\npurpose of accelerated aging is to bring lifetime of an EIS to hours, days or\nweeks. Shortening the lifetime of an EIS to such an extent, allows for the\nstudy of the insulation materials behavior as well as investigate ways to\nestimate the remaining useful life (RUL) for the purpose of predictive\nmaintenance. Unexpected failures in operation processes, where redundancy is\nnot present, can lead to high economical losses, machine downtime and often\nhealth and safety risks.

The problem is\nparameterised by the Reynolds, Froude, Weber and Ekman numbers. The variation\nof the Ekman number ($Ek$), defined to be proportional of the rotational speed\nof the cylinder, has a strong effect on the flow characteristics. Simulations\nare conducted over a wide range of $Ek$ values ($0 \\leq Ek \\leq 484$) in order\nto provide detailed insight into how this parameter influences the flow. Our\nresults indicate that increasing $Ek$, which leads to a rise in the magnitude\nof centrifugal forces, produces a stabilising effect, suppressing wave\nformation. Key flow features, such as the transition from a 2D to a more\ncomplex 3D wave regime, are influenced significantly by this stabilisation, and\nare investigated in detail. Furthermore, the imposed rotation results in\ndistinct flow characteristics such as the development of angled waves, which\narise due to the combination of gravitationally- and centrifugally-driven\nmotion in the axial and azimuthal directions, respectively.

The separation motion and\ntrajectory are generated based on the 3D visual perception of the obstacle\ninformation around the target. A linear push is used to clear the obstacles\nfrom the area below the target, while a zig-zag push that contains several\nlinear motions is proposed to push aside more dense obstacles. The zig-zag push\ncan generate multi-directional pushes and the side-to-side motion can break the\nstatic contact force between the target and obstacles, thus helping the gripper\nto receive a target in more complex situations. Moreover, we propose a novel\ndrag operation to address the issue of mis-capturing obstacles located above\nthe target, in which the gripper drags the target to a place with fewer\nobstacles and then pushes back to move the obstacles aside for further\ndetachment.

For maps which are invertible at any moment of\ntime the very existence of propagator is already guaranteed and hence the only\nissue is (complete) positivity and trace-preservation.

The structure of\nthis final ice layer presents a surprising linear shape that thickens with the\ndistance. This paper presents a theoretical model and experimental\ncharacterisation of the ice growth dynamics, the final ice shape and the\ntemperature fields. In a first part, we establish a 2D model, based on the\nadvection-diffusion heat equations, that allows us to predict the shape of the\nice structure and the temperature fields in both the water and the ice. Then,\nwe study experimentally the formation of the ice layer and we show that both\nthe transient dynamics and the final shape are well captured by the model. In a\nlast part, we characterise experimentally the temperature fields in the ice and\nin the water, using an infrared camera. The model shows an excellent agreement\nwith the experimental fields. In particular, it predicts well the linear\ndecrease of the water surface temperature observed along the plane, confirming\nthat the final ice shape is a consequence of the interaction between the\nthermal boundary layer and the free surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 13:18:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

The completion time of such\na task can be profoundly affected by restart: the occasional resetting of the\ntask's underlying random process. Consequently, determining when restart will\nimpede or expedite task completion is a subject of major importance. In recent\nyears researchers explored this subject extensively, with main focus set on\naverage behavior, i.e. on mean completion times. On the one hand, the mean\napproach asserts the centrality of \"sharp restart\" -- resetting with\ndeterministic (fixed) timers. On the other hand, a significant drawback of the\nmean approach is that it provides no insight regarding tail behavior, i.e. the\noccurrence likelihood of extreme completion times. Addressing sharp restart,\nand shifting the focus from means to extremes, this paper establishes a\ncomprehensive tail-behavior analysis of completion times. Employing the\nreliability-engineering notion of hazard rate, the analysis yields a set of\nuniversal results that determine -- from a tail-behavior perspective -- when\nsharp restart will impede or expedite task completion. The universal results\nare formulated in terms of explicit and highly applicable hazard-rate criteria.\nWith the novel results at hand, a universal average-&-tail classification\nmanual for sharp restart is devised. The manual specifies general scenarios in\nwhich -- rather counter-intuitively -- sharp restart has an opposite effect on\naverage behavior and on tail behavior: decreasing mean completion times while\ndramatically increasing the likelihood of extreme completion times; and,\nconversely, increasing mean completion times while dramatically decreasing the\nlikelihood of extreme completion times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 13:43:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 10:32:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

In this paper, we find numerically static vortex solutions\nwhere the scalar and gauge fields have a non-singular profile under Einstein\ngravity in an AdS$_3$ background. Vortices with different winding numbers $n$,\nVEV $v$ and cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ are obtained. These vortices have\npositive mass and are not BTZ black holes as they have no event horizon. The\nmass is determined in two ways: by subtracting the numerical values of two\nseparate asymptotic metrics and via an integral that is purely over the matter\nfields. The mass of the vortex increases as the cosmological constant becomes\nmore negative and this coincides with the core of the vortex becoming smaller\n(compressed). We then consider the vortex with gravity in asymptotically flat\nspacetime for different values of the coupling $\\alpha=1/(16 \\pi G)$. At the\norigin, the spacetime has its highest curvature and there is no singularity. It\ntransitions to an asymptotic conical spacetime with angular deficit that\nincreases significantly as $\\alpha$ decreases. For comparison, we also consider\nthe vortex without gravity in flat spacetime. For this case, one cannot obtain\nthe mass by the first method (subtracting two metrics) but remarkably, via a\nlimiting procedure, one can obtain an integral mass formula. In the absence of\ngauge fields, there is a well-known logarithmic divergence in the energy of the\nvortex. With gravity, we present this divergence in a new light.

Our approach is motivated\nby the current COVID-19 pandemic. The main hypothesis is the existence of two\npopulations of susceptible persons, one which obeys confinement and for which\nthe infection rate does not exceed 1, and a population which, being non\nconfined for various imperatives, can be substantially more infective. The\nmodel, initially formulated as a differential system, is discretised following\na specific procedure, the discrete system serving as an integrator for the\ndifferential one. Our model is calibrated so as to correspond to what is\nobserved in the COVID-19 epidemic.\n  Several conclusions can be reached, despite the very simple structure of our\nmodel. First, it is not possible to pinpoint the genesis of the epidemic by\njust analysing data from when the epidemic is in full swing. It may well turn\nout that the epidemic has reached a sizeable part of the world months before it\nbecame noticeable. Concerning the confinement scenarios, a universal feature of\nall our simulations is that relaxing the lockdown constraints leads to a\nrekindling of the epidemic. Thus we sought the conditions for the second\nepidemic peak to be lower than the first one. This is possible in all the\nscenarios considered (abrupt, progressive or stepwise exit) but typically a\nprogressive exit can start earlier than an abrupt one. However, by the time the\nprogressive exit is complete, the overall confinement times are not too\ndifferent. From our results, the most promising strategy is that of a stepwise\nexit. And in fact its implementation could be quite feasible, with the major\npart of the population (minus the fragile groups) exiting simultaneously but\nobeying rigorous distancing constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 14:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

Here we propose a parametrization of this function based\nupon the satisfaction of exact constraints. For the static ($\\omega$ = 0)\nlimit, we modify the model of Constantin and Pitarke at small wavevector q to\nrecover the known second-order gradient expansion, plus other changes. For all\nfrequencies $\\omega$ at q $=$ 0, we use the model of Gross, Kohn, and Iwamoto.\nA Cauchy integral extends this model to complex $\\omega$ and implies the\nstandard Kramers-Kronig relations. A scaling relation permits closed forms for\nnot only the imaginary but also the real part of f$_{xc}$ for real $\\omega$. We\nthen combine these ingredients by damping out the $\\omega$ dependence at large\nq in the same way that the q dependence is damped.

The resulting correlation energy from integration over imaginary\n$\\omega$ is essentially exact. The plasmon pole of the density response\nfunction is found by analytic continuation of f$_{xc}$ to $\\omega$ just below\nthe real axis, and the resulting plasmon lifetime first decreases from infinity\nand then increases as q grows from 0 toward the electron-hole continuum. A\nstatic charge-density wave is found for r$_s$ $>$ 69, and shown to be\nassociated with softening of the plasmon mode. The exchange-only version of our\nstatic kernel confirms Overhauser's 1968 prediction that correlation enhances\nthe charge-density wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 14:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Recently, deep learning-based approaches have been proposed\nfor beamforming design. Although these approaches using deep neural networks\nexhibit reasonable performance gain compared with conventional\noptimization-based algorithms, their scalability is an emerging problem for\nlarge systems in which beamforming design becomes a more demanding task. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel deep unfolded trainable beamforming design with\nhigh scalability and efficiency. The algorithm is designed by expanding the\nrecursive structure of an existing algorithm based on projections onto convex\nsets and embedding a constant number of trainable parameters to the expanded\nnetwork, which leads to a scalable and stable training process. Numerical\nresults show that the proposed algorithm can accelerate its convergence speed\nby using unsupervised learning, which is a challenging training process for\ndeep unfolding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 14:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect\nthe infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting\nthis disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the\nfastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed\nspecific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with\nCOVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning\nmodels to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We\nfirst prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available\ndatasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease presence were identified by\nboard-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2,000 radiograms\nwas used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including\nResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease\nin the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining\n3,000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98%\n($\\pm$ 3%), while having a specificity rate of around 90%. Besides sensitivity\nand specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic\n(ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction, and confusion matrix\nof each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of lung regions\npotentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps contain\nmost of the infected areas annotated by our board certified radiologist. While\nthe achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a\nlarger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy\nrates.

The price process is defined\nas a geometric random walk combined with jumps modelled by separate, discrete\ndistributions associated with positive (and negative) bubbles. The key\ningredient of the model is to assume that the sizes of the jumps are\nproportional to the bubble size. Thus, the jumps tend to efficiently bring back\nexcess bubble prices close to a normal or fundamental value (efficient\ncrashes). This is different from existing processes studied that assume jumps\nthat are independent of the mispricing. The present model is simplified\ncompared to Kreuser and Sornette (2018) in that we ignore the possibility of a\nchange of the probability of a crash as the price accelerates above the normal\nprice.

As a primary source of outperformance, we determine knowledge\nabout the presence of crashes, but interestingly find that knowledge of only\nthe size, and not the time of occurrence, already provides a significant and\nrobust edge.

These\nmechanical deformations give rise to a change in porosity and permeability,\nwhich results in non-linearity of the mathematical problem. Assuming that the\ndeformations are very small, the model provided by Biot's theory of linear\nporoelasticity is used to determine the local displacement of the skeleton of a\nporous medium, as well as the fluid flow through the pores. In this continuum\nscale model, the Kozeny-Carman equation is commonly used to determine the\npermeability of the porous medium from the porosity. The Kozeny-Carman relation\nstates that flow through the pores is possible at a certain location as long as\nthe porosity is larger than zero at this location in the aquifer. However, from\nnetwork models it is known that percolation thresholds exist, indicating that\nthe permeability will be equal to zero if the porosity becomes smaller than\nthese thresholds. In this paper, the relationship between permeability and\nporosity is investigated. A new permeability-porosity relation, based on the\npercolation theory, is derived and compared with the Kozeny-Carman relation.\nThe strongest feature of the new approach is related to its capability to give\na good description of the permeability in case of low porosities. However, with\nthis network-inspired approach small values of the permeability are more likely\nto occur.

Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretisations have\nseveral advantageous properties. They can be used for arbitrary domains and\nsupport a structured data layout, which is important on modern chip\narchitectures. For smooth solutions, higher order approximations can be\nparticularly efficient since errors decrease exponentially in the polynomial\ndegree. Due to the wide separation of timescales in atmospheric dynamics,\nsemi-implicit time integrators are highly efficient, since the implicit\ntreatment of fast waves avoids tight constraints on the time step size, and can\ntherefore improve overall efficiency. However, if implicit-explicit (IMEX)\nintegrators are used, a large linear system of equations has to be solved in\nevery time step. A particular problem for DG discretisations of\nvelocity-pressure systems is that the normal Schur-complement reduction to an\nelliptic system for the pressure is not possible since the numerical fluxes\nintroduce artificial diffusion terms. For the shallow water equations, which\nform an important model system, hybridised DG methods have been shown to\novercome this issue.

Special considerations were given for the structure design to\nensure effective carrier confinement and optical confinement that lead to\nlasing. Lasing was observed at temperatures from 10 to 100 K with emission\npeaks at around 2300 nm. The minimum threshold of 598 A/cm2 was recorded at 10\nK and the threshold increased to 842 A/cm2 at 77 K.

This setting does not sufficiently consider the class distribution\ninformation between the two domains, which could adversely affect the reduction\nof domain gap. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called\nConditional ADversarial Image Translation (CADIT) to explicitly align the class\ndistributions given samples between the two domains. It integrates a\ndiscriminative structure-preserving loss and a joint adversarial generation\nloss. The former effectively prevents undesired label-flipping during the whole\nprocess of image translation, while the latter maintains the joint distribution\nalignment of images and labels. Furthermore, our approach enforces the\nclassification consistence of target domain images before and after adaptation\nto aid the classifier training in both domains. Extensive experiments were\nconducted on multiple benchmark datasets including Digits, Faces, Scenes and\nOffice31, showing that our approach achieved superior classification in the\ntarget domain when compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Also, both\nqualitative and quantitative results well supported our motivation that\naligning the class distributions can indeed improve domain adaptation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 15:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

As a result, many\nsystems like CitiBike and Divvy provide riders with information about the\nnetwork via smartphone apps so that riders can find stations with available\nbikes. However, not all customers have adopted the use of these smartphone apps\nfor their station selection. By combining customer choice modeling and finite\ncapacity queueing models, we explore the impact of the smartphone app\ntechnology to increase throughput and reduce blocking in bike sharing systems.\nTo this end, we prove a mean-field limit and a central limit theorem for an\nempirical process of the number of stations with $k$ bikes.

Research in this area promises to personalize healthcare in\npreviously unimaginable ways by allowing individual tracking of wellness and\nhealth information. This chapter shall cover the different facets of Wearable\nInternet of Things (WIoT) and ways in which it is a key driving technology\nbehind the concept of personalized healthcare. It shall discuss the theoretical\naspects of WIoT, focusing on functionality, design and applicability. Moreover,\nit shall also elaborate on the role of wearable sensors, big data and cloud\ncomputing as enabling technologies for WIoT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 14:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

Currently, the soiling monitoring market is moving toward\noptical sensors that measure transmittance or reflectance, rather than directly\nmeasuring the impact of soiling on the performance of photovoltaic modules.\nThese sensors, which use a single optical measurement, are not able to correct\nthe soiling losses that depend on the solar irradiance spectra and on the\nspectral response of the monitored PV material. This work investigates methods\nthat can improve the optical detection of soiling by extracting the full\nsoiling spectrum profiles using only two or three monochromatic measurements.\nSpectral transmittance data, measured with a spectrophotometer and collected\nduring a 46-week experimental soiling study carried out in Ja\\'en, Spain, was\nanalysed in this work. The use of a spectral profile for the hemispherical\ntransmittance of soiled PV glass is found to significantly improve the soiling\ndetection, returning the lowest errors independently of the PV materials and\nirradiance conditions. In addition, this work shows that it is also possible to\nselect the measurement wavelengths to minimize the soiling loss detection error\ndepending on the monitored PV semiconductor material (silicon, CdTe, a-Si, CIGS\nand a representative perovskite). The approaches discussed in this work are\nalso found to be more robust to potential measurement errors compared to single\nwavelength measurement techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 10:24:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 17:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}
