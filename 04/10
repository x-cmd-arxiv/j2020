The proposed\nmethod was tested by using field testing data from multiple Bluetooth 5 smart\near tags in a pasture.

Unfortunately,\nbecause a given patient's record may contain hundreds of notes and reports,\nidentifying relevant information within these in the short time typically\nallotted to a case is very difficult. We propose and evaluate models that\nextract relevant text snippets from patient records to provide a rough case\nsummary intended to aid physicians considering one or more diagnoses. This is\nhard because direct supervision (i.e., physician annotations of snippets\nrelevant to specific diagnoses in medical records) is prohibitively expensive\nto collect at scale. We propose a distantly supervised strategy in which we use\ngroups of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes observed in\n'future' records as noisy proxies for 'downstream' diagnoses. Using this we\ntrain a transformer-based neural model to perform extractive summarization\nconditioned on potential diagnoses.

As such, anapole states have been claimed to correspond\nto non-radiating sources. Nevertheless, these states are commonly found\ntogether with high order multipole moments featuring non-zero overall\nfar-field. In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a\nfully non-scattering state governed by a novel 4-fold hybrid anapole with all\nthe dominant multipoles suppressed by their corresponding toroidal (retarded)\nterms, i.e. a dark analogue of the superscattering effect. This invisibility\nstate, however, allows for non-trivial near-field maps enabled by the unique\ninterplay of the resonant Mie-like and Fabry-Perot modes as demonstrated by the\nquasi-normal modal expansion. Moreover, the hybrid anapole state is shown to be\nprotected; the spectral position of the non-scattering point remains\nunperturbed in the presence of a substrate with significantly high refractive\nindex.

TI qubits have fundamental\nadvantages over other technologies such as superconducting qubits, including\nhigh qubit quality, coherence and connectivity. However, current TI systems are\nsmall in size, with 5-20 qubits and typically use a single trap architecture\nwhich has fundamental scalability limitations. To progress towards the next\nmajor milestone of 50-100 qubits, a modular architecture termed the Quantum\nCharge Coupled Device (QCCD) has been proposed. In a QCCD-based TI device,\nsmall traps are connected through ion shuttling. While the basic hardware\ncomponents for such devices have been demonstrated, building a 50-100 qubit\nsystem is challenging because of a wide range of design possibilities for trap\nsizing, communication topology and gate implementations and the need to match\ndiverse application resource requirements.\n  Towards realizing QCCD systems with 50-100 qubits, we perform an extensive\narchitectural study evaluating the key design choices of trap sizing,\ncommunication topology and operation implementation methods.

Using six applications and several hardware design points, we show that\ntrap sizing and communication topology choices can impact application\nreliability by up to three orders of magnitude.

We mainly review our recent experimental and\ntheoretical work on formation and dynamics of such quadratic frequency combs.\nWe experimentally demonstrated comb generation in two configurations: a cavity\nfor second harmonic generation, where combs are generated both around the pump\nfrequency and its second harmonic, and a degenerate optical parametric\noscillator, where combs are generated around the pump frequency and its\nsub-harmonic. The experiments have been supported by a thorough theoretical\nanalysis, aimed at modelling the dynamics of quadratic combs, both in frequency\nand time domains, providing useful insights into the physics of this new class\nof optical frequency comb synthesizers. Quadratic combs establish a new class\nof efficient frequency comb synthesizers, with unique features, which could\nenable straightforward access to new spectral regions and stimulate novel\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 17:49:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-14"}

We classify the multi-year long-term light curves of EVQs into\nthree categories roughly in the order of decreasing smoothness: monotonic\ndecreasing or increasing (3.7%), single broad peak and dip (56.8%), and more\ncomplex patterns (39.5%). The rareness of monotonic cases suggests that the\nmajor mechanisms driving the extreme optical variability do not operate over\ntimescales much longer than a few years. Simulated light curves with a damped\nrandom walk model generally under-predict the first two categories with\nsmoother long-term trends. Despite the different long-term behaviors of these\nEVQs, there is little dependence of the long-term trend on the physical\nproperties of quasars, such as their luminosity, BH mass, and Eddington ratio.\nThe large dynamic range of optical flux variability over multi-year timescales\nof these EVQs allows us to explore the ensemble correlation between the\nshort-term (< 6 months) variability and the seasonal-average flux across the\ndecade-long baseline (the rms-mean flux relation). We find that unlike the\nresults for X-ray variability studies, the linear short-term flux variations do\nnot scale with the seasonal-average flux, indicating different mechanisms that\ndrive the short-term flickering and long-term extreme variability of accretion\ndisk emission. Finally, we present a sample of 16 EVQs, where the approximately\nbell-shaped large amplitude variation in the light curve can be reasonably well\nfit by a simple microlensing model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 19:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

The stationary states of a generic setup with a single active\nmedium are thoroughly discussed, showing that the role of the passive\ncomponents can be combined into a single transfer function that takes into\naccount the corresponding resonances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 20:16:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 May 2020 09:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

In this\nspirit, we design a method to boost the computational power of near-term\nquantum computers by adapting protocols used in quantum error correction to\nimplement \"Approximate Quantum Error Correction (AQEC).\" By approximating\nfully-fledged error correction mechanisms, we can increase the compute volume\n(qubits $\\times$ gates, or \"Simple Quantum Volume (SQV)\") of near-term\nmachines. The crux of our design is a fast hardware decoder that can\napproximately decode detected error syndromes rapidly. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate a proof-of-concept that approximate error decoding can be\naccomplished online in near-term quantum systems by designing and implementing\na novel algorithm in Single-Flux Quantum (SFQ) superconducting logic\ntechnology. This avoids a critical decoding backlog, hidden in all offline\ndecoding schemes, that leads to idle time exponential in the number of T gates\nin a program.\n  Our design utilizes one SFQ processing module per physical qubit. Employing\nstate-of-the-art SFQ synthesis tools, we show that the circuit area, power, and\nlatency are within the constraints of contemporary quantum system designs.\nUnder pure dephasing error models, the proposed accelerator and AQEC solution\nis able to expand SQV by factors between 3,402 and 11,163 on expected near-term\nmachines.

By\nsplitting a blockchain into several parallel-run committees (shards), it helps\nincrease transaction throughput, reduce computational resources required, and\nincrease reward expectation for participants. Recently, several flexible\nsharding methods that can tolerate up to $n/2$ Byzantine nodes ($n/2$ security\nlevel) have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from three main\ndrawbacks. First, in a non-sharding blockchain, nodes can have different weight\n(power or stake) to create a consensus, and as such an adversary needs to\ncontrol half of the overall weight in order to manipulate the system ($p/2$\nsecurity level). In blockchain sharding, all nodes carry the same weight. Thus,\nit is only under the assumption that honest participants create as many nodes\nas they should that a $n/2$ security level blockchain sharding reaches the\n$p/2$ security level. Second, when some nodes leave the system, other nodes\nneed to be reassigned, frequently, from shard to shard in order to maintain the\nsecurity level. This has an adverse effect on system performance. Third, while\nsome $n/2$ approaches can maintain data integrity with up to $n/2$ Byzantine\nnodes, their systems can halt with a smaller number of Byzantine nodes. In this\npaper, we present a $p/2$ security level blockchain sharding approach that does\nnot require honest participants to create multiple nodes, requires less node\nreassignment when some nodes leave the system, and can prevent the system from\nhalting. Our experiments show that our new approach outperforms existing\nblockchain sharding approaches in terms of security, transaction throughput and\nflexibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 20:31:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 06:42:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 22:59:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 19:30:43 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2020 13:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 09:30:37 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 04:16:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

Intuitively, if the prevalence of\ninfection is small, this could result in a large reduction of the total number\nof tests required. Despite this, the use of group testing in medical studies\nhas been limited, largely due to skepticism about the impact of pooling on the\naccuracy of a given assay. While there is a large body of research addressing\nthe issue of testing errors in group testing studies, it is customary to assume\nthat the misclassification parameters are known from an external population\nand/or that the values do not change with the group size.

Here we investigate the\npossibility of a LM model to reproduce features of a more realistic approach\nthat represents the interplay of collective adatom diffusion and the external\nflux. In the LM model introduced here, each adatom may execute $G$ hops to\nneighboring columns of the deposit, but a hop attempt from a site with $n$\nlateral neighbors has probability $P^n$, with $P<1$. These rules resemble those\nof the Clarke-Vvedensky (CV) model without energy barriers at step edges, whose\nmain parameters are the diffusion-to-deposition ratio $R$ on terraces and the\ndetachment probability $\\epsilon$ per lateral neighbor. At short times, the\nroughness of the LM model can be written in terms of a scaling function of $G$\nand $P$ and the growth exponent is consistent with the Villain-Lai-Das Sarma\nuniversality class. The evolution of the surface roughness and of the\nautocorrelation function of the CV model is reproduced with reasonable accuracy\nby the LM model with suitable choices of parameters. The increase of the\nparameters $G$ and $R$ of those models produces smoother film surfaces, while\nthe increase of $P$ and $\\epsilon$ smoothen the terrace boundaries at short\nlengthscales. However, the detachment probabilities of the two models have very\ndifferent effects on the surface roughness: in the LM model, for fixed $G$, the\nsurface roughness increases as $P$ increases; in the CV model, the surface\nsmoothens as $\\epsilon$ increases, for fixed $R$. This result is related to the\nnon-Markovian nature of the LM model, since the diffusivity of an adatom\ndepends on its history at the film surface and may be severely reduced after a\ndetachment from a terrace step.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 23:56:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 22:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

Social\ndistancing measures that \"flatten the curve\" of the disease to bring demand\nwithin the capacity of healthcare systems are predicted to save many lives in\nhigh-income countries, such that practically any economic cost is worth\nbearing. These social distancing policies are estimated to be less effective in\npoor countries with younger populations less susceptible to COVID-19, and more\nlimited healthcare systems, which were overwhelmed before the pandemic.\nMoreover, social distancing lowers disease risk by limiting people's economic\nopportunities. Poorer people are less willing to make those economic\nsacrifices. They place relatively greater value on their livelihood concerns\ncompared to contracting COVID-19. Not only are the epidemiological and economic\nbenefits of social distancing much smaller in poorer countries, such policies\nmay exact a heavy toll on the poorest and most vulnerable.

There is a subfamily of ideal almost Pogorelov\npolytopes corresponding to ideal right-angled polytopes. We prove that the\nproperties to be an almost Pogorelov polytope and an ideal almost Pogorelov\npolytope are $B$-rigid. As a corollary we obtain that $3$-dimensional\nassociahedron $As^3$ and permutohedron $Pe^3$ are $B$-rigid. We generalize\nmethods known for Pogorelov polytopes. We obtain results on $B$-rigidity of\nsubsets in $H^*(\\mathcal{Z}_P,\\mathbb Z)$ and prove an analog of the so-called\nseparable circuit condition (SCC). As an example we consider the ring\n$H^*(\\mathcal{Z}_{As^3},\\mathbb Z)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 01:32:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 17:20:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 16:18:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 10:00:19 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 16:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

To solve these decomposed synthesis conditions that are\ncoupled only over neighboring subsystems, we propose a distributed method based\non the alternating direction method of multipliers.

Then, a\nnew classification of systems is introduced that consists of groups of\nhomogeneous subsystems with different interconnection types.

It is often a common situation that\nthere's no training data accessible for some signal classes to perform a\nrecognition task. Hence, as widely-used in image processing field, zero-shot\nlearning (ZSL) is also very important for signal recognition. Unfortunately,\nZSL regarding this field has hardly been studied due to inexplicable signal\nsemantics. This paper proposes a ZSL framework, signal recognition and\nreconstruction convolutional neural networks (SR2CNN), to address relevant\nproblems in this situation. The key idea behind SR2CNN is to learn the\nrepresentation of signal semantic feature space by introducing a proper\ncombination of cross entropy loss, center loss and autoencoder loss, as well as\nadopting a suitable distance metric space such that semantic features have\ngreater minimal inter-class distance than maximal intra-class distance. The\nproposed SR2CNN can discriminate signals even if no training data is available\nfor some signal class. Moreover, SR2CNN can gradually improve itself in the aid\nof signal detection, because of constantly refined class center vectors in\nsemantic feature space. These merits are all verified by extensive experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 03:24:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 12:07:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 06:38:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2020 09:59:50 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2020 02:34:35 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 02:35:18 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 06:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Hence, the study of EUV waves plays an important role in solar\neruptions and Space Weather. Here we present an EUV wave associated with a\nfilament activation that did not evolve into any eruption. Due to the\ncontinuous magnetic flux emergence and cancellation around its one end, the\nfilament rose with untwisting motion, and the filament mass flowed towards\nanother end along the rising fields. Intriguingly, following the filament\nactivation, an EUV wave formed with a fast constant speed ($\\sim$500 km\ns$^{-1}$) ahead of the mass flow, and the overlying coronal loops expanded both\nin lateral and radial directions. Excluding the possibility of a remote flare\nand an absent coronal mass ejection, we suggest that the EUV wave was only\nclosely associated with the filament activation. Furthermore, their intimate\nspacial and temporal relationship indicates that the EUV wave was likely\ndirectly triggered by the lateral expansion of overlying loops. We propose that\nthe EUV wave can be interpreted as linear fast-mode wave, and the most vital\nkey for the successful generation of the EUV wave is the impulsive early-phase\nlateral expansion of overlying loops that was driven by the activated filament\nmass flow without any eruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 04:30:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

However, the openness of wireless\ntransmission raises increasing concerns on user privacy, since either the human\nidentity or human motion is sensitive in certain scenarios, including personal\nresidence, laboratory, and office. Researchers have reported that commodity\nWiFi signals can be abused to identify users. To dispel this threat, in this\npaper we propose a privacy-preserving framework to effectively hide the\ninformation of user behaviors in wireless signals while retaining the ability\nof user authentication. The core of our framework is a novel Siamese\nnetwork-based deep model, namely RFBP-Net. In this way, wireless sensing\nreveals user information moderately. We conduct extensive experiments on both\nthe real WiFi and RFID system and open datasets. The experiment results show\nthat RFBP-Net is able to significantly reduce the activity recognition\naccuracy, i.e., 70% reduction in the RFID system and 80% reduction in the WiFi\nsystem, with a slight penalty in the user authentication accuracy, i.e., only\n5% and 1% decrease in the RFID and WiFi system, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 05:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-13"}

Most existing works assume\nsource and target data share the identical label space, which is often\ndifficult to be satisfied in many real-world applications. With the emergence\nof big data, there is a more practical scenario called partial domain\nadaptation, where we are always accessible to a more large-scale source domain\nwhile working on a relative small-scale target domain. In this case, the\nconventional domain adaptation assumption should be relaxed, and the target\nlabel space tends to be a subset of the source label space. Intuitively,\nreinforcing the positive effects of the most relevant source subclasses and\nreducing the negative impacts of irrelevant source subclasses are of vital\nimportance to address partial domain adaptation challenge. This paper proposes\nan efficiently-implemented Deep Residual Correction Network (DRCN) by plugging\none residual block into the source network along with the task-specific feature\nlayer, which effectively enhances the adaptation from source to target and\nexplicitly weakens the influence from the irrelevant source classes.\nSpecifically, the plugged residual block, which consists of several\nfully-connected layers, could deepen basic network and boost its feature\nrepresentation capability correspondingly. Moreover, we design a weighted\nclass-wise domain alignment loss to couple two domains by matching the feature\ndistributions of shared classes between source and target. Comprehensive\nexperiments on partial, traditional and fine-grained cross-domain visual\nrecognition demonstrate that DRCN is superior to the competitive deep domain\nadaptation approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 06:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-13"}

On the one hand, these degradations lead to severe\ndiscriminative information loss, which significantly obstructs identity\nrepresentation learning; on the other hand, the feature mismatch problem caused\nby low-level visual variations greatly reduces retrieval performance. An\nintuitive solution to this problem is to utilize low-level image restoration\nmethods to improve the image quality. However, existing restoration methods\ncannot directly serve to real-world Re-ID due to various limitations, e.g., the\nrequirements of reference samples, domain gap between synthesis and reality,\nand incompatibility between low-level and high-level methods. In this paper, to\nsolve the above problem, we propose a degradation invariance learning framework\nfor real-world person Re-ID. By introducing a self-supervised disentangled\nrepresentation learning strategy, our method is able to simultaneously extract\nidentity-related robust features and remove real-world degradations without\nextra supervision. We use low-resolution images as the main demonstration, and\nexperiments show that our approach is able to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on several Re-ID benchmarks.

In this paper, we\npropose the ContourNet, which effectively handles these two problems taking a\nfurther step toward accurate arbitrary-shaped text detection. At first, a\nscale-insensitive Adaptive Region Proposal Network (Adaptive-RPN) is proposed\nto generate text proposals by only focusing on the Intersection over Union\n(IoU) values between predicted and ground-truth bounding boxes. Then a novel\nLocal Orthogonal Texture-aware Module (LOTM) models the local texture\ninformation of proposal features in two orthogonal directions and represents\ntext region with a set of contour points. Considering that the strong\nunidirectional or weakly orthogonal activation is usually caused by the\nmonotonous texture characteristic of false-positive patterns (e.g. streaks.),\nour method effectively suppresses these false positives by only outputting\npredictions with high response value in both orthogonal directions.

So, far, this process has been studied under the assumption that\ndust coagulates and drifts throughout the full protoplanetary disk. However,\nobservations show that many disks are structured in rings that may be due to\npressure maxima, preventing the global radial drift of the dust.\n  Aims: We study how the pebble-accretion paradigm changes if the dust is\nconfined in a ring.\n  Results: Planet Type-I migration is stopped in a ring, but not necessarily at\nits center. If the entropy-driven corotation torque is desaturated, the planet\nis located in a region with a low density of dust, which severely limits its\naccretion rate. If instead the planet is near the ring's center, its accretion\nrate can be similar to the one it would have in a classic (ring-less) disk of\nequivalent dust density. However, the growth rate of the planet is limited by\nthe diffusion of dust in the ring and the final planet's mass is bounded by the\ntotal ring's mass. The DSHARP rings are too far from the star to allow the\nformation of massive planets within the disk's lifetime. However, a similar\nring rescaled to 5 AU could lead to the formation of a planet incorporating the\nfull ring's mass in less than 1/2 My.\n  Conclusions: The existence of rings may not be an obstacle to planet\nformation by pebble-accretion. However, for accretion to be effective the\nresting position of the planet has to be relatively near the ring's center and\nthe ring needs to be not too far from the central star. The formation of\nplanets in rings can explain the existence of giant planets with core masses\nsmaller than the so-called pebble isolation mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 08:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Among these, Micro Pattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGD) are the\nlatest frontier and allow to overcome many limitations of the pre-existing\ndetectors, such as the radiation tolerance and the rate capability. The gas\nElectron Multiplier (GEM) is a MPGD that exploits an intense electric field in\na reduced amplification region in order to prevent discharges. Several\namplification stages, like in a triple-GEM, allow to increase the detector gain\nand to reduce the discharge probability.

Imposing such a\nlimitation results in two main drawbacks; over-computation due to inaccurate\nprediction of the straggling behaviour, and under-utilization due to treating\nworkers as straggler/non-straggler and discarding partial computations carried\nout by stragglers.

It is quite challenging and usually requires user\ninteractive trimaps and plenty of high quality annotated data. Annotating such\nkind of data is labor intensive and requires great skills beyond normal users,\nespecially considering the very detailed hair part of humans. In contrast,\ncoarse annotated human dataset is much easier to acquire and collect from the\npublic dataset. In this paper, we propose to use coarse annotated data coupled\nwith fine annotated data to boost end-to-end semantic human matting without\ntrimaps as extra input. Specifically, we train a mask prediction network to\nestimate the coarse semantic mask using the hybrid data, and then propose a\nquality unification network to unify the quality of the previous coarse mask\noutputs. A matting refinement network takes in the unified mask and the input\nimage to predict the final alpha matte.

We already showed how BLOB (\"Boltzmann-Langevin One Body\"), a\nmodel developed to simulate heavy ion interactions up to few hundreds of MeV/u,\ncould simulate also $^{12}$C reactions in the same energy domain. However, its\ncomputation time is too long for any medical application. For this reason we\npresent the possibility of emulating it with a Deep Learning algorithm.\nMethods: The BLOB final state is a Probability Density Function (PDF) of\nfinding a nucleon in a position of the phase space. We discretised this PDF and\ntrained a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) to reproduce such a discrete PDF. As a\nproof of concept, we developed and trained a VAE to emulate BLOB in simulating\nthe interactions of $^{12}$C with $^{12}$C at 62 MeV/u. To have more control on\nthe generation, we forced the VAE latent space to be organised with respect to\nthe impact parameter ($b$) training a classifier of $b$ jointly with the VAE.\nResults: The distributions obtained from the VAE are similar to the input ones\nand the computation time needed to use the VAE as a generator is negligible.\nConclusions: We show that it is possible to use a Deep Learning approach to\nemulate a model developed to simulate nuclear reactions in the energy range of\ninterest for Ion-therapy.

The same transform can be\napplied even to monolingual speakers.\n  In our experiments speaker data from an English-Spanish (Mexican) bilingual\nspeaker was used, and the goal was to enable English speakers to speak Spanish\nand Spanish speakers to speak English. We found that the simple transform was\nsufficient to convert a voice from one language to the other with a high degree\nof naturalness.

Our understanding of\nengagement patterns on mental health platforms is limited but critical to\ninform the role, limitations, and design of these platforms.

The first strategy, called self-punishment (SP),\ndiscourages the agent from making mistakes that lead to undesirable terminal\nstates.

A classical theorem of Casten,\nHolland [19] and Matano [49] states that stable patterns do not exist in convex\ndomains. In this article, we show that the assumptions of convexity of the\ndomain and stability of the pattern in this theorem can be relaxed in several\ndirections. In particular, we propose a general criterion for the non-existence\nof patterns, dealing with possibly non-convex domains and unstable patterns.\nOur results unfold the interplay between the geometry of the domain, the\nmagnitude of the nonlinearity, and the stability of patterns. We propose\nseveral applications, for example, we prove that (under a geometric assumption)\nthere exist no patterns if the domain is shrunk or if the nonlinearity has a\nsmall magnitude. We also refine the result of Casten Holland and Matano and\nshow that it is robust under smooth perturbations of the domain and the\nnonlinearity.

The irradiation-induced changes of the\nmagnetic anisotropy, coupling energies and tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR)\nexhibited a correlated dependence on the ion fluence, which allowed us to\ndistinguish between two irradiation regimes. In the low-fluence regime, ${\\Phi}\n< 10^{14} cm^{-2}$, the parameters required for having a functioning MTJ were\npreserved: the anisotropy of the FeCoB free layer (FL) was weakly modulated\nfollowing a small decrease in the saturation magnetization $M_S$; the TMR\ndecreased continuously; the interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) and the exchange\nbias (EB) decreased slightly. In the high-fluence regime, ${\\Phi} > 10^{14}\ncm^{-2}$, the MTJ was rendered inoperative: the modulation of the FL anisotropy\nwas strong, caused by a strong decrease in $M_S$, ascribed to a high degree of\ninterface intermixing between the FL and the Ta capping; the EB and IEC were\nalso lost, likely due to intermixing of the layers composing the synthetic\nantiferromagnet; and the TMR vanished due to the irradiation-induced\ndeterioration of the MgO barrier and MgO/FeCoB interfaces. We demonstrate that\nthe layers surrounding the FL play a decisive role in determining the trend of\nthe magnetic anisotropy evolution resulting from the irradiation, and that an\nion-fluence window exists where such a modulation of magnetic anisotropy can\noccur, while not losing the TMR or the magnetic configuration of the MTJ.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 13:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-18"}

This proposal, however, has been challenged, given that\naway from the source the soft hair behaves as a coordinate transformation that\nforms an Abelian group, thus unable to store any information. To maintain the\nspirit of the soft hair but circumvent these obstacles, we consider Hawking\nradiation as a probe sensitive to the entire history of the black hole\nevaporation, where the soft hairs on the horizon are induced by the absorption\nof a null anisotropic flow, generalizing the shockwave considered by Hawking et\nal. To do so we introduce two different time-dependent extensions of the\ndiffeomorphism associated with the soft hair, where one is the backreaction of\nthe anisotropic null flow, and the other is a coordinate transformation that\nproduces the Unruh effect and a Doppler shift to the Hawking spectrum.\nTogether, they form an exact BMS charge generator on the entire manifold that\nallows the nonperturbative analysis of the black hole horizon, whose surface\ngravity, i.e. the Hawking temperature, is found to be modified. The\nmodification depends on an exponential average of the anisotropy of the null\nflow with a decay rate of 4M, suggesting the emergence of a new 2-D degree of\nfreedom on the horizon, which could be a way out of the information loss\nparadox.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 14:14:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 06:53:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 01:50:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 10:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

Blockchain technology provides primitives to\nrepresent these resources as digital assets on a secure distributed ledger. Due\nto the proliferation of blockchain-based assets, there is an increasing need\nfor a generic mechanism to trade assets between isolated platforms. To date,\nthere is no such mechanism without reliance on a trusted third party.\n  In this work, we address this shortcoming and present XChange. Unlike\nexisting approaches for decentralized asset trading, we decouple trade\nmanagement and the actual exchange of assets. XChange mediates trade of any\ndigital asset between isolated blockchain platforms while limiting the fraud\nconducted by adversarial parties. We first describe a generic, five-phase\ntrading protocol that establishes and executes trade between individuals. This\nprotocol accounts full trade specifications on a separate blockchain. We then\ndevise a lightweight system architecture, composed of all required components\nfor a generic asset marketplace.\n  We implement XChange and conduct real-world experimentation. We leverage an\nexisting, lightweight blockchain, TrustChain, to account all orders and full\ntrade specifications. By deploying XChange on multiple low-resource devices, we\nshow that a full trade completes within half a second. To quantify the\nscalability of our mechanism, we conduct further experiments on our compute\ncluster. We conclude that the throughput of XChange, in terms of trades per\nsecond, scales linearly with the system load. Furthermore, we find that XChange\nexhibits superior throughput and order fulfil latency compared to related\ndecentralized exchanges, BitShares and Waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 14:19:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-13"}

Depending on the excitation frequency\nand properties of the shell, however, an UCA may oscillate nonlinearly even at\nsufficiently low excitation pressures violating the assumption in the linear\nattenuation theory. Notably, the concern on the estimation of the attenuation\ncoefficient of a microbubble at resonance using linearized approximation has\nlong been addressed. In this article, we investigated the attenuation\nphenomenon through analyzing the energy dissipation of a single UCA and\npropagating waves in an UCA suspension, both of which employed a nonlinear\nRayleigh-Plesset equation.

In this work we explore the effect of uniaxial\ntensile-strain on the electrical transport properties of bi- and few-layered\nMoS2, a promising 2D semiconductor. Raman shifts corresponding to the in-plane\nvibrational modes show a redshift with strain indicating a softening of the\nin-plane phonon modes.

Transport measurements show a substantial enhancement in the\nelectrical conductivity with a high piezoresistive gauge factor of ~ 321\nsuperior to that for Silicon for our bi-layered device. The simulations\nconducted over the experimental findings reveal a substantial reduction of the\nSchottky barrier height at the electrical contacts in addition to the\nresistance of MoS2.

These methods however stagnate\nwhen the majority of the population becomes non-dominated, preventing\nconvergence to the Pareto set. Hypervolume-based MO optimization has shown\npromising results to overcome this. Direct use of the hypervolume however\nresults in no selection pressure for dominated solutions. The recently\nintroduced Sofomore framework overcomes this by solving multiple interleaved\nsingle-objective dynamic problems that iteratively improve a single\napproximation set, based on the uncrowded hypervolume improvement (UHVI). It\nthereby however loses many advantages of population-based MO optimization, such\nas handling multimodality. Here, we reformulate the UHVI as a quality measure\nfor approximation sets, called the uncrowded hypervolume (UHV), which can be\nused to directly solve MO optimization problems with a single-objective\noptimizer.

However, few investigations focusing either on the\ntheoretical analysis or on algorithm design for the approximation ability of\nthe generator of GANs have been reported. This paper will first theoretically\nanalyze GANs' approximation property. Similar to the universal approximation\nproperty of the fully connected neural networks with one hidden layer, we prove\nthat the generator with the input latent variable in GANs can universally\napproximate the potential data distribution given the increasing hidden\nneurons. Furthermore, we propose an approach named stochastic data generation\n(SDG) to enhance GANs'approximation ability.

Thus, unlike adversarial training, which only\nconsiders the balance between accuracy and robustness, we come to a more\nmeaningful and critical issue, i.e., the balance among accuracy, efficiency and\nrobustness (AER). Recently, some related works focused on this issue, but with\ndifferent observations, and the relations among AER remain unclear. This paper\nfirst investigates the robustness of pruned models with different compression\nratios under the gradual pruning process and concludes that the robustness of\nthe pruned model drastically varies with different pruning processes,\nespecially in response to attacks with large strength. Second, we test the\nperformance of mixing the clean data and adversarial examples (generated with a\nprescribed uniform budget) into the gradual pruning process, called adversarial\npruning, and find the following: the pruned model's robustness exhibits high\nsensitivity to the budget. Furthermore, to better balance the AER, we propose\nan approach called blind adversarial pruning (BAP), which introduces the idea\nof blind adversarial training into the gradual pruning process. The main idea\nis to use a cutoff-scale strategy to adaptively estimate a nonuniform budget to\nmodify the AEs used during pruning, thus ensuring that the strengths of AEs are\ndynamically located within a reasonable range at each pruning step and\nultimately improving the overall AER of the pruned model. The experimental\nresults obtained using BAP for pruning classification models based on several\nbenchmarks demonstrate the competitive performance of this method: the\nrobustness of the model pruned by BAP is more stable among varying pruning\nprocesses, and BAP exhibits better overall AER than adversarial pruning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 02:27:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

On the other hand, unrestricted AT uses\nunconstrained AEs, resulting in the use of AEs located beyond the decision\nboundary; these overestimated AEs significantly lower the accuracy on clean\ndata.

To\nsolve the first problem, we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive\nintegrated moving average model and Wavelet-based forecasting model that can\ngenerate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed\ncases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The predictions of\nthe future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective\nallocation of health care resources and will act as an early-warning system for\ngovernment policymakers. In the second problem, we applied an optimal\nregression tree algorithm to find essential causal variables that significantly\naffect the case fatality rates for different countries. This data-driven\nanalysis will necessarily provide deep insights into the study of early risk\nassessments for 50 immensely affected countries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 18:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

A\nlower-bound on the number of memory states of such machines is proved if they\nwere to simulate the experiment that corresponds to the Peres-Mermin square.\nMoreover, the proof of this lower bound is seen to scale to a certain\ngeneralization of the Peres- Mermin square.

Using an open-source co-optimization model of the power\nsector and four options for supplying hydrogen at German filling stations, we\nfind a trade-off between energy efficiency and temporal flexibility: for lower\nshares of renewables and hydrogen, more energy-efficient and less flexible\nsmall-scale on-site electrolysis is optimal. For higher shares of renewables\nand/or hydrogen, more flexible but less energy-efficient large-scale hydrogen\nsupply chains gain importance as they allow disentangling hydrogen production\nfrom demand via storage. Liquid hydrogen emerges as particularly beneficial,\nfollowed by liquid organic hydrogen carriers and gaseous hydrogen. Large-scale\nhydrogen supply chains can deliver substantial power sector benefits, mainly\nthrough reduced renewable surplus generation.

The system is based on security\npolicies to determine if an access request is allowed. However, of late, the\ngrowing popularity of big data has created a new challenge which the security\npolicy management is facing with such as dynamic and update policies in run\ntime. Applications of dynamic policies have brought many benefits to modern\ndomains. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies focusing\non solving authorization problems in the dynamic policy environments. In this\narticle, we focus on analyzing and classifying when an update policy occurs,\nand provide a pragmatic solution for such dynamic policies. The contribution of\nthis work is twofold: a novel solution for managing the policy changes even\nwhen the access request has been granted, and an XACML-based implementation to\nempirically evaluate the proposed solution. The experimental results show the\ncomparison between the newly introduced XACs-DyPol framework with Balana (an\nopen source framework supporting XACML 3.0). The datasets are XACML 3.0-based\npolicies, including three samples of real-world policy sets. According to the\ncomparison results, our XACs-DyPol framework performs better than Balana in\nterms of all updates in dynamic security policy cases. Specially, our proposed\nsolution outperforms by an order of magnitude when the policy structure\nincludes complex policy sets, policies, and rules or some complicated\ncomparison expression which contains higher than function and less than\nfunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 11:36:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}
