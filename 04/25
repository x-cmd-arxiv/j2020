In the original paper of Shapiro (1964),\nit is stated that there is a time delay in the radar signals between Earth and\nVenus that pass near a massive object (the Sun), compared to the path taken in\nthe absence of any mass. The reason for this delay is connected with the\ninfluence of gravity on the coordinate velocity of a light ray in a\ngravitational potential. The contribution from the change of the path length,\nwhich happens to be of second order, is considered as negligible. Nevertheless,\nin the gravitational lens theory the geometrical delay, related to the change\nof path length, is routinely taken into account along with the potential term.\nIn this work we explain this apparent discrepancy. We address the contribution\nof the geometric part of the time delay in different situations, and introduce\na unified treatment with two limiting regimes of lensing. One of these limits\ncorresponds to the time delay experiments near the Sun where the geometrical\ndelay is shown to be negligible. The second corresponds to the typical\ngravitational lens scenario with multiple imaging where the geometrical delay\nis shown to be significant. We introduce a compact, analytical, and\nquantitative criteria based on relation between the angular position of source\nand the Einstein radius. This criterion allows one to find out easily when it\nis necessary to take the geometrical delay into account. In particular, it is\nshown that the geometrical delay is non-negligible in the case of good\nalignment between source, lens and observer, because in such a case it becomes\na first order quantity (the same order as the potential term).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 16:34:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 00:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

A realisation of a curve is a\npolyline connecting one point from each region. Given an uncertain curve and a\nsecond (certain or uncertain) curve, we seek to compute the lower and upper\nbound Fr\\'echet distance, which are the minimum and maximum Fr\\'echet distance\nfor any realisations of the curves.\n  We prove that both the upper and lower bound problems are NP-hard for the\ncontinuous Fr\\'echet distance in several uncertainty models, and that the upper\nbound problem remains hard for the discrete Fr\\'echet distance. In contrast,\nthe lower bound (discrete and continuous) Fr\\'echet distance can be computed in\npolynomial time.

In particular, the\nconvection of vortical structures across a grid refinement interface is likely\nto generate spurious noise that may impact the whole computation domain. This\nissue becomes critical in the case of aeroacoustic simulations, where accurate\npressure estimations are of paramount importance. The purpose of this article\nis to identify the issues occurring at the interface and to propose possible\nsolutions yielding significant improvements for aeroacoustic simulations. More\nspecifically, this study highlights the critical involvement of non-physical\nmodes in the generation of spurious vorticity and acoustics. The identification\nof these modes is made possible thanks to linear stability analyses performed\nin the fluid core, and non-hydrodynamic sensors specifically developed to\nsystematically emphasize them during a simulation. Investigations seeking pure\nacoustic waves and sheared flows allow for isolating the contribution of each\nmode. An important result is that spurious wave generation is intrinsically due\nto the change in the grid resolution (i.e. aliasing) independently of the\ndetails of the grid transition algorithm. Finally, the solution proposed to\nminimize spurious wave amplitude consists of choosing an appropriate collision\nmodel in the fluid core so as to cancel the non-hydrodynamic mode contribution\nregardless the grid coupling algorithm. Results are validated on a convected\nvortex and on a turbulent flow around a cylinder where a huge reduction of both\nspurious noise and vorticity are obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 17:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

We explain how this extension preserves the\nreliability, efficiency, and tightness of the asymptotic method. We then\nexplore examples which illustrate both the generality of our method as well as\nthe importance of parameter estimation and data processing within the\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 17:15:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 23:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-29"}

It has been recently shown that, for some regimes, this setting\nattains the same Degrees-of-Freedom as the ideal centralized setting with\nperfect CSI sharing, in which all the transmitters are endowed with the best\nestimate available at any transmitter. This result is restricted by the\nlimitations of the DoF metric, as it only provides information about the slope\nof growth of the capacity as a function of the SNR, without any insight about\nthe possible performance at a given SNR. To overcome this limitation, we\nanalyze the affine approximation of the rate on the high-SNR regime for this\ndecentralized Network MISO setting for the antenna configurations in which it\nachieves the DoF of the centralized setting. We show that, for a regime of\nantenna configurations, it is possible to asymptotically attain the same\nachievable rate as in the ideal centralized scenario. Consequently, it is\npossible to achieve the beamforming gain of the ideal perfect-CSI-sharing\nsetting even if only a subset of transmitters is endowed with precise CSI,\nwhich can be exploited in scenarios such as distributed massive MIMO where the\nnumber of transmit antennas is much bigger than the number of served users.\nThis outcome is a consequence of the synergistic compromise between CSI\nprecision at the transmitters and consistency between the locally-computed\nprecoders, which is an inherent trade-off of decentralized settings that does\nnot exist in a centralized CSI configuration.

The recent emerging Graph Signal\nProcessing field can also contribute to enabling the IoT by providing key\ntools, such as graph filters, for processing the data associated with the\nsensor devices. Graph filters can be performed over WSNs in a distributed\nmanner by means of a certain number of communication exchanges among the nodes.\nBut, WSNs are often affected by interferences and noise, which leads to view\nthese networks as directed, random and time-varying graph topologies.

The information bottleneck method formalizes\nthis as an information-theoretic optimization problem by maintaining an optimal\ntradeoff between compression (throwing away irrelevant input information), and\npredicting the target. In many problem settings, including the reinforcement\nlearning problems we consider in this work, we might prefer to compress only\npart of the input. This is typically the case when we have a standard\nconditioning input, such as a state observation, and a \"privileged\" input,\nwhich might correspond to the goal of a task, the output of a costly planning\nalgorithm, or communication with another agent. In such cases, we might prefer\nto compress the privileged input, either to achieve better generalization\n(e.g., with respect to goals) or to minimize access to costly information\n(e.g., in the case of communication). Practical implementations of the\ninformation bottleneck based on variational inference require access to the\nprivileged input in order to compute the bottleneck variable, so although they\nperform compression, this compression operation itself needs unrestricted,\nlossless access. In this work, we propose the variational bandwidth bottleneck,\nwhich decides for each example on the estimated value of the privileged\ninformation before seeing it, i.e., only based on the standard input, and then\naccordingly chooses stochastically, whether to access the privileged input or\nnot.

Problems in\nmaterials design are often considered in the context of process-property\nlinkage by bypassing the materials structure, or in the context of\nstructure-property linkage as in microstructure-sensitive design problems.\nHowever, there is a lack of research effort in studying materials design\nproblems in the context of process-structure linkage, which has a great\nimplication in reverse engineering. In this work, given a target\nmicrostructure, we propose an active learning high-throughput microstructure\ncalibration framework to derive a set of processing parameters, which can\nproduce an optimal microstructure that is statistically equivalent to the\ntarget microstructure. The proposed framework is formulated as a noisy\nmulti-objective optimization problem, where each objective function measures a\ndeterministic or statistical difference of the same microstructure descriptor\nbetween a candidate microstructure and a target microstructure. Furthermore, to\nsignificantly reduce the physical waiting wall-time, we enable the\nhigh-throughput feature of the microstructure calibration framework by adopting\nan asynchronously parallel Bayesian optimization by exploiting high-performance\ncomputing resources. Case studies in additive manufacturing and grain growth\nare used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework, where\nkinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation is used as a forward predictive model,\nsuch that for a given target microstructure, the target processing parameters\nthat produced this microstructure are successfully recovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 19:16:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

We\nperform SMR measurements in a wide range of temperatures and fit the results by\nusing a microscopic model. From this fitting procedure we obtain the\ntemperature dependence of the spin conductances ($G_s$, $G_r$ and $G_i$),\ndisentangling the contribution of field-like torque ($G_i$), damping-like\ntorque ($G_r$), and spin-flip scattering ($G_s$). An interfacial exchange field\nof the order of 1 meV acting upon the conduction electrons of Pt can be\nestimated from $G_i$, which is at least three times larger than $G_r$ below the\nCurie temperature. Our work provides an easy method to quantify this\ninterfacial spin-splitting field, which play a key role in emerging fields such\nas superconducting spintronics and caloritronics, and topological quantum\ncomputation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 22:14:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 22:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}

In many studies, binary data are shared in a spatially aggregated\nform to protect privacy. For example, rather than reporting the location and\nresult for each individual that was tested for a disease, researchers may\nreport that a disease was detected or not detected within geopolitical units.\nOften, the spatial aggregation process obscures the values of response\nvariables, spatial covariates, and locations of each individual, which makes\nrecovering individual-level inference difficult. We show that applying a series\nof transformations, including a change of support, to a bivariate point process\nmodel allows researchers to recover individual-level inference for spatial\ncovariates from spatially aggregated binary data.

Several\ncommonly-encountered operators in nuclear many-body calculations, including the\nmagnetic dipole and electric quadrupole operators (in the impulse\napproximation) and generators of SU(3) and Sp(3,R) symmetry groups, are\nbilinear in the coordinates and momenta of the nucleons and, when expressed in\nintrinsic form, become two-body operators.

Since the skin lesion datasets are usually limited\nand statistically biased, while designing an effective fusion approach, it is\nimportant to consider not only the performance of each classifier on the\ntraining/validation dataset, but also the relative discriminative power (e.g.,\nconfidence) of each classifier regarding an individual sample in the testing\nphase, which calls for an active fusion approach. Furthermore, in skin lesion\nanalysis, the data of certain classes (e.g., the benign lesions) is usually\nabundant making them an over-represented majority, while the data of some other\nclasses (e.g., the cancerous lesions) is deficient, making them an\nunderrepresented minority. It is more crucial to precisely identify the samples\nfrom an underrepresented (i.e., in terms of the amount of data) but more\nimportant minority class (e.g., certain cancerous lesion).

Conventionally, there is renormalization scale ambiguity\nfor the fixed-order pQCD predictions, which assigns an arbitrary range and an\narbitrary error for the fixed-order pQCD prediction. The principle of maximum\nconformality (PMC) adopts the renormalization group equation to determine the\nmagnitude of the coupling constant and hence determines an effective momentum\nflow of the process, which is independent to the choice of renormalization\nscale. There is thus no renormalization scale ambiguity in PMC predictions. To\nconcentrate our attention on the MOM gauge dependence, we first apply the PMC\nto deal with the pQCD series. We adopt the Higgs boson decay width,\n$\\Gamma(H\\to gg)$, up to five-loop QCD contributions as an example to show how\nthe gauge dependence behaves before and after applying the PMC. It is found\nthat the Higgs decay width $\\Gamma (H\\to gg)$ depends very weakly on the\nchoices of the MOM schemes, being consistent with the renormalization group\ninvariance.

Direct\nnumerical simulations (DNS) are carried out for an incompressible turbulent\nflow in a channel where one wall has a small bump; two bump geometries are\nconsidered, that produce mildly separated and attached flows. Friction drag\nreduction is achieved by applying streamwise-travelling waves of spanwise\nvelocity (StTW).\n  The local friction reduction produced by the StTW is found to vary along the\ncurved wall, leading to a global friction reduction that, for the cases\nstudied, is up to 10\\% larger than that obtained in the plane-wall case.\nMoreover, the modified skin friction induces non-negligible changes of pressure\ndrag, which is favorably affected by StTW and globally reduces by up to 10\\%.\nThe net power saving, accounting for the power required to create the StTW, is\npositive and, for the cases studied, is one half larger than the net saving of\nthe planar case. The study suggests that reducing friction at the surface of a\nbody of complex shape induces further effects, a simplistic evaluation of which\nmight lead to underestimating the total drag reduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2020 08:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

The so-called Kelly Criterion is used as the\nperformance metric; i.e., maximizing the expected logarithmic growth of a\ntrader's account, and the portfolio obtained is called the frequency-based\nKelly optimal portfolio. The focal point of this paper is to extend upon the\nresults of our previous work to obtain various optimality characterizations on\nthe portfolio. To be more specific, using Kelly's criterion in our\nfrequency-based formulation, we first prove necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor the frequency-based Kelly optimal portfolio. With the aid of these\nconditions, we then show several new optimality characterizations such as\nexpected ratio optimality and asymptotic relative optimality, and a result\nwhich we call the Extended Dominant Asset Theorem. That is, we prove that the\n$i$th asset is dominant in the portfolio if and only if the Kelly optimal\nportfolio consists of that asset only. The word \"extended\" on the theorem comes\nfrom the fact that it was only a sufficiency result that was proved in our\nprevious work. Hence, in this paper, we improve it to involve a proof of the\nnecessity part. In addition, the trader's survivability issue (no bankruptcy\nconsideration) is also studied in detail in our frequency-based trading\nframework. Finally, to bridge the theory and practice, we propose a simple\ntrading algorithm using the notion called dominant asset condition to decide\nwhen should one triggers a trade. The corresponding trading performance using\nhistorical price data is reported as supporting evidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2020 09:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-23"}

Many published gas-cooled reactor\ndesigns for space applications deliver outputs in the 100 kWe regime, with\ntypical power densities of around 4 MW/m$^3$. Here we present a gas-cooled\nreactor design - referred to as JANUS - employing He-Xe coolant and operating\non a direct Brayton cycle, that can achieve a high power output (around 0.8\nMWe) and higher power density (24 MW/m$^3$) than previously published designs.\nThe core employs a coated particle fuel form with uranium nitride kernels in a\ngraphite matrix and with a high packing fraction (45%).\n  Starting from the CEA's published OPUS space reactor design, a variety of\napproaches were considered for achieving high power densities in a gas-cooled\nreactor, including changing the core aspect ratio. Our JANUS design uses a\ndecreased coolant channel diameter and fuel element pitch, whilst increasing\nthe number of fuel elements and employing radial enrichment zoning. The design\nachieves a significant increase in power density whilst obeying core-life\nlimits of 2000 Effective Full Power Days and a peak fuel operating temperature\nof 1900 K. The core has been modelled neutronically with the ERANOS and SERPENT\ncodes, with a simple yet robust thermal dimensioning tool developed by us to\nstudy peak fuel temperatures, to ensure the fuel operates within its design\nlimitations and to aid optimisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2020 11:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

We show, combining these\nmodels with empirical data on strategic decisions in dyadic social dilemmas,\nthat individual strategic decisions are to a large extent predictable, despite\nnot being \"rational.\" The analysis of these models also allows us to conclude\nthat: (i) individuals do not perceive games according their game-theoretical\nstructure; (ii) individuals make decisions using combinations of multiple\nsimple strategies, which our approach reveals naturally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2020 14:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

However, a simple difference-in-means estimator will give a biased\nestimate of the TATE when outcomes of control units depend on the outcomes of\ntreatment units, an issue we refer to as test-control interference. Using a\nsimulation built on top of data from Airbnb, this paper considers the use of\nmethods from the network interference literature for online marketplace\nexperimentation. We model the marketplace as a network in which an edge exists\nbetween two sellers if their goods substitute for one another. We then simulate\nseller outcomes, specifically considering a \"status quo\" context and\n\"treatment\" context that forces all sellers to lower their prices. We use the\nsame simulation framework to approximate TATE distributions produced by using\nblocked graph cluster randomization, exposure modeling, and the Hajek estimator\nfor the difference in means. We find that while blocked graph cluster\nrandomization reduces the bias of the naive difference-in-means estimator by as\nmuch as 62%, it also significantly increases the variance of the estimator. On\nthe other hand, the use of more sophisticated estimators produces mixed\nresults. While some provide (small) additional reductions in bias and small\nreductions in variance, others lead to increased bias and variance.

However, the number of confirmed cases depends on the\ntesting policy, and it is important to understand how the number of positive\ncases obtained using different testing policies reveals the unknown ground\ntruth. We develop an agent-based simulation framework in Python that can\nsimulate various testing policies as well as interventions such as lockdown\nbased on them. The interaction between the agents can take into account various\ncommunities and mobility patterns. A distinguishing feature of our framework is\nthe presence of another `flu'-like illness with symptoms similar to COVID-19,\nthat allows us to model the noise in selecting the pool of patients to be\ntested. We instantiate our model for the city of Bengaluru in India, using\ncensus data to distribute agents geographically, and traffic flow mobility data\nto model long-distance interactions and mixing. We use the simulation framework\nto compare the performance of three testing policies: Random Symptomatic\nTesting (RST), Contact Tracing (CT), and a new Location Based Testing policy\n(LBT). We observe that if a sufficient fraction of symptomatic patients come\nout for testing, then RST can capture the ground truth quite closely even with\nvery few daily tests. However, CT consistently captures more positive cases.\nInterestingly, our new LBT, which is operationally less intensive than CT,\ngives performance that is comparable with CT. In another direction, we compare\nthe efficacy of these three testing policies in enabling lockdown, and observe\nthat CT flattens the ground truth curve maximally, followed closely by LBT, and\nsignificantly better than RST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 17:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

We\nintroduce a demographic scaling model to estimate COVID-19 infections using an\nbroadly applicable approach that is based on minimal data requirements:\nCOVID-19 related deaths, infection fatality rates (IFRs), and life tables. As\nmany countries lack reliable estimates of age-specific IFRs, we scale IFRs\nbetween countries using remaining life expectancy as a marker to account for\ndifferences in age structures, health conditions, and medical services. Across\n10 countries with most COVID-19 deaths as of May 13, 2020, the number of\ninfections is estimated to be four [95% prediction interval: 2-11] times higher\nthan the number of confirmed cases. Cross-country variation is high.

However, black-box attacks are much more practical for\nreal-world applications. Universal perturbations applicable across multiple\nimages are gaining popularity due to their innate generalizability.

This regular\nSchwarzschild black hole has a spherical central region with a radius of the\norder of the Planck length. On the other hand, due to the positively\naccelerating expansion of the Universe, it seems that there exists a universal\nrepulsive force known as dark energy. In the framework of quantum field\ntheories, the quintessence field is a candidate model for investigating and\nmodeling dark energy. Accordingly, by taking into account the quintessential\nmatter field in the background of the Schwarzschild black hole, Kiselev gained\nthe metric of this black hole surrounded by quintessence. By combining these\ntwo above ideas, in the present study we consider the quantum-corrected\nSchwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence to investigate null and\ntime-like geodesics structure. Generally, this study points out that black\nholes are quantum-gravitational objects. We will show that the accelerated\nexpansion of the Universe, instead of dark energy, happens because of the\npresence of quantum effects in this setup. Also, due to the presence of the\ncentral Planck-size sphere, the regular black hole has been possessed a\nshifting over radial coordinate in its inner structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2020 06:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

Traditional 2D x-ray images are\noften extremely difficult to examine due to the fact that they are tightly\npacked and contain a wide variety of cluttered and occluded objects.

However, many of these deep face recognition\nmodels perform relatively poorly in handling profile faces compared to frontal\nfaces. The major reason for this poor performance is that it is inherently\ndifficult to learn large pose invariant deep representations that are useful\nfor profile face recognition. In this paper, we hypothesize that the profile\nface domain possesses a gradual connection with the frontal face domain in the\ndeep feature space. We look to exploit this connection by projecting the\nprofile faces and frontal faces into a common latent space and perform\nverification or retrieval in the latent domain. We leverage a coupled\ngenerative adversarial network (cpGAN) structure to find the hidden\nrelationship between the profile and frontal images in a latent common\nembedding subspace. Specifically, the cpGAN framework consists of two GAN-based\nsub-networks, one dedicated to the frontal domain and the other dedicated to\nthe profile domain.

With the use of different\nscales, there is a difficulty in comparing scientific results, such as NESSCA\nand SARA scales, tools for assessing the commitment to Machado-Joseph disease\n(SCA3/MJD). Objective: Explore the method of scale equating and demonstrate its\napplication through NESSCA and SARA scales, using the Item Response Theory\n(IRT) approach in assessing SCA3/MJD commitment. Methods: Data came from 227\npatients from the Hospital de Cl\\'inicas de Porto Alegre with SCA3/MJD who have\ncomplete measures for NESSCA and/or SARA scales. The equating design used is\nthat of non-equivalent groups with common items, with separate calibration. The\nIRT model used in the estimation of the parameters was the generalized partial\ncredit, for NESSCA and SARA. The linear transformation was performed using the\nMean/Mean, Mean/Sigma, Haebara and StokingLord methods and the equation of the\ntrue score was applied to obtain an estimated relationship between the scores\nof the scales. Results: Difference between NESSCA score estimated by SARA and\nobserved NESSCA score has shown median of 0.82 points, by Mean/Sigma method.\nThis was the best method of linear transformation among the tested.\nConclusions: This study extended the use of scale equating under IRT approach\nto health outcomes and established an equivalence relationship between NESSCA\nand SARA scores, making the comparison between patients and scientific results\nfeasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 20:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-11"}

A recent hypothesis is that the fractal\nbranching vasculature is responsible for the dominant echo pattern from organs\nsuch as the liver. In that case an analysis of cylindrical scattering\nstructures arranged across a power law distribution of sizes is warranted.\nUsing a simple model of echo strength and basic transformation rules from\nprobability, we derive the first order statistics of speckle considering the\namplitude, the intensity, and the natural log of amplitude. The results are\ngiven by long tailed distributions that have been studied in the statistics\nliterature for other fields. Examples are given from simulations and animal\nstudies, and the theoretical fit to these preliminary data support the overall\nframework as a plausible model for characterizing ultrasound speckle\nstatistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 16:33:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-11"}

But companies and consumer organizations\ncomplain about the failure to add new features to their networks and according\nto their need, like much of the works to be done automatically and they also\nlike to develop and expand their networks on the software side so they do not\nneed new expensive hardware for many of the activities and needs of their\nnetwork. Analysis of the control layers and writing data in Software-Defined\nNetwork facilitate network management and accelerate innovation in network. In\norder to develop broad networks of SDN, often a large number controller is\nneeded and located position of controllers in the SDN networks and can be\nraised as an important and basic issue in the field of SDN network and have\nimpact on reliability of SDN networks. This paper focused on latency and\nreliability in SDN networks. The latency here means the delay in response to\nthe request of data path that has a significant impact on network latency. In\nthis paper it is shown that the number of controllers and their position can be\neffective on two measures; reliability and latency in SDN networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 19:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

While it is understood that the brain accomplishes Core Object\nRecognition through feedforward, hierarchical computations through the visual\nstream, the underlying algorithms that allow for invariant representations to\nform downstream is still not well understood. (DiCarlo et al., 2012) Various\ncomputational perceptual models have been built to attempt and tackle the\nobject identification task in an artificial perceptual setting. Artificial\nNeural Networks, computational graphs consisting of weighted edges and\nmathematical operations at vertices, are loosely inspired by neural networks in\nthe brain and have proven effective at various visual perceptual tasks,\nincluding object characterization and identification. (Pinto et al., 2008)\n(DiCarlo et al., 2012) For many data analysis tasks, learning representations\nwhere each dimension is statistically independent and thus disentangled from\nthe others is useful. If the underlying generative factors of the data are also\nstatistically independent, Bayesian inference of latent variables can form\ndisentangled representations. This thesis constitutes a research project\nexploring a generalization of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), $\\beta$-VAE,\nthat aims to learn disentangled representations using variational inference.\n$\\beta$-VAE incorporates the hyperparameter $\\beta$, and enforces conditional\nindependence of its bottleneck neurons, which is in general not compatible with\nthe statistical independence of latent variables. This text examines this\narchitecture, and provides analytical and numerical arguments, with the goal of\ndemonstrating that this incompatibility leads to a non-monotonic inference\nperformance in $\\beta$-VAE with a finite optimal $\\beta$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2020 08:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}
