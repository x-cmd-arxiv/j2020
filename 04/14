On the other hand, the large scale swept-back halo remains undetected,\nlikely a consequence of its markedly blue color relative to the parent body\nbelt. We analyze the curvature of the disk spine and estimate a radius of\n$\\approx$100au for the parent body belt, smaller than past scattered light\nstudies but consistent with thermal emission maps of the system. We employ\nthree different flux-preserving post-processing methods to suppress the\nresidual starlight and evaluate the surface brightness and polarization profile\nalong the disk spine. Unlike past studies of the system, our high fidelity\nimages reveal the disk to be highly symmetric and devoid of morphological and\nsurface brightness perturbations. We find the dust scattering properties of the\nsystem to be consistent with those observed in other debris disks, with the\nexception of HR 4796.

We propose two types of case-control studies that can be carried out\njointly in test-settings for symptomatic persons. The first, the test-negative\ncase-control design (TND) is the easiest to implement; it only demands\ncollecting information about potential risk factors for COVID-19 from the\ntested symptomatic persons. The second, standard case-control studies with\npopulation controls, requires the collection of data on one or more population\ncontrols for each person who is tested in the test facilities, so that\ntest-positives and test-negatives can each be compared with population\ncontrols. The TND will detect differences in risk factors between symptomatic\npersons who have COVID-19 (test-positives) and those who have other respiratory\ninfections (test-negatives). However, risk factors with effect sizes of equal\nmagnitude for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections will not be\nidentified by the TND. Therefore, we discuss how to add population controls to\ncompare with the test-positives and the test-negatives, yielding two additional\ncase-control studies.

The model treats transport of heat\nand electric current in the plasma and the electrodes in a coupled manner and\naccounts for gas convection in the chamber. Multiple surface processes at the\nelectrodes are modeled, including the formation of space-charge limited\nsheaths, ablation and deposition of carbon, emission and absorption of\nradiation and electrons. The simulations show that the arc is constricted near\nthe cathode and the anode front surfaces leading to the formation of electrode\nspots. The cathode spot is a well-known phenomenon and mechanisms of its\nformation were reported elsewhere. However, the anode spot formation mechanism\ndiscovered in this work was not reported before. We conclude that the spot\nformation is not related to plasma instability, as commonly believed in case of\nconstricted discharge columns, but rather occurs due to the highly nonlinear\nnature of heat balance in the anode. We additionally demonstrate this property\nwith a reduced anode heat transfer model. We also show that the spot size\nincreases with the arc current. This anode spot behavior was also confirmed in\nour experiments. Due to the anode spot formation, a large gradient of carbon\ngas density occurs near the anode, which drives a portion of the ablated carbon\nback to the anode at its periphery. This can consequently reduce the total\nablation rate. Simulation results also show that the arc can reach local\nchemical equilibrium (LCE) state in the column region while the local thermal\nequilibrium (LTE) state is not typically achieved for experimental conditions.\nIt shows that it is important to account for different electron and gas\ntemperatures in the modeling of short carbon arcs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 16:40:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 15:08:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

The\nsuspected detection stems from an excess of infrared emission from a dust blob\nnear the compact object's predicted position. The infrared excess could be due\nto the decay of isotopes like 44Ti, accretion luminosity from a neutron star or\nblack hole, magnetospheric emission or a wind originating from the spindown of\na pulsar, or thermal emission from an embedded, cooling neutron star (NS\n1987A). It is shown that the last possibility is the most plausible as the\nother explanations are disfavored by other observations and/or require\nfine-tuning of parameters. Not only are there indications the dust blob\noverlaps the predicted location of a kicked compact remnant, but its excess\nluminosity also matches the expected thermal power of a 30 year old neutron\nstar. Furthermore, models of cooling neutron stars within the Minimal Cooling\nparadigm readily fit both NS 1987A and Cas A, the next-youngest known neutron\nstar. If correct, a long heat transport timescale in the crust and a large\neffective stellar temperature are favored, implying relatively limited crustal\nn-1S0 superfluidity and an envelope with a thick layer of light elements,\nrespectively. If the locations don't overlap, then pulsar spindown or accretion\nmight be more likely, but the pulsar's period and magnetic field or the\naccretion rate must be rather finely tuned.

In stark contrast, here we show that a single quantum particle can\nsense the correlations between multiple uses of a channel at different moments\nof time. In an extreme example, we show that a channel that outputs white noise\nwhen the particle is sent at a definite time can exhibit correlations that\nenable a perfect transmission of classical bits when the particle is sent at a\nsuperposition of two times. In contrast, we show that, in the lack of\ncorrelations, a single particle sent at a superposition of two times undergoes\nan effective channel with classical capacity of at most 0.16 bits. When\nmultiple transmission lines are available, time correlations can be used to\nsimulate the application of quantum channels in a coherent superposition of\nalternative causal orders, and even to provide communication advantages that\nare not accessible through the superposition of causal orders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 17:50:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 17:00:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 16:13:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 18:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

The transmitter node\nimplements a selective $k$ encoding policy such that rather than encoding all\npossible $n$ realizations, the transmitter node encodes the most probable $k$\nrealizations. We consider three different policies regarding the remaining\n$n-k$ less probable realizations: $highest$ $k$ $selective$ $encoding$ which\ndisregards whenever a realization from the remaining $n-k$ values occurs;\n$randomized$ $selective$ $encoding$ which encodes and sends the remaining $n-k$\nrealizations with a certain probability to further inform the receiver node at\nthe expense of longer codewords for the selected $k$ realizations; and\n$highest$ $k$ $selective$ $encoding$ $with$ $an$ $empty$ $symbol$ which sends a\ndesignated empty symbol when one of the remaining $n-k$ realizations occurs.\nFor all of these three encoding schemes, we find the average age and determine\nthe age-optimal real codeword lengths, including the codeword length for the\nempty symbol in the case of the latter scheme, such that the average age at the\nreceiver node is minimized.

The goal is to shed light on two\nmysteries in deep neural networks: (i) a nonsmooth activation function like\nReLU outperforms a smooth one like hyperbolic tangent; (ii) successful neural\nnetwork architectures rely on having many layers, even though a shallow network\ncan approximate any function arbitrary well. We performed extensive experiments\non the persistent homology of a wide range of point cloud data sets, both real\nand simulated. The results consistently demonstrate the following: (1) Neural\nnetworks operate by changing topology, transforming a topologically complicated\ndata set into a topologically simple one as it passes through the layers. No\nmatter how complicated the topology of $M$ we begin with, when passed through a\nwell-trained neural network $f : \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^p$, there is a\nvast reduction in the Betti numbers of both components $M_a$ and $M_b$; in fact\nthey nearly always reduce to their lowest possible values:\n$\\beta_k\\bigl(f(M_i)\\bigr) = 0$ for $k \\ge 1$ and $\\beta_0\\bigl(f(M_i)\\bigr) =\n1$, $i =a, b$. Furthermore, (2) the reduction in Betti numbers is significantly\nfaster for ReLU activation than hyperbolic tangent activation as the former\ndefines nonhomeomorphic maps that change topology, whereas the latter defines\nhomeomorphic maps that preserve topology. Lastly, (3) shallow and deep networks\ntransform data sets differently -- a shallow network operates mainly through\nchanging geometry and changes topology only in its final layers, a deep one\nspreads topological changes more evenly across all layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 17:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

The macroscopic properties of the\ninterstellar medium propagate into the properties of GMCs condensing out of it,\nwith correlations between e.g. the galactic and GMC scale gas pressures,\nsurface densities and volume densities. That way, the galactic environment sets\nthe initial conditions for star formation within GMCs. After the onset of\nmassive star formation, stellar feedback from e.g. photoionisation, stellar\nwinds, and supernovae eventually contributes to dispersing the parent cloud,\ndepositing energy, momentum and metals into the surrounding medium, thereby\nchanging the properties of galaxies. This cycling of matter between gas and\nstars, governed by star formation and feedback, is therefore a major driver of\ngalaxy evolution. Much of the recent debate has focused on the durations of the\nvarious evolutionary phases that constitute this cycle in galaxies, and what\nthese can teach us about the physical mechanisms driving the cycle. We review\nresults from observational, theoretical, and numerical work to build a\ndynamical picture of the evolutionary lifecycle of GMC evolution, star\nformation, and feedback in galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

This\nrelation links the stellar mass of a galaxy with its star formation rate (SFR)\nand its gas-phase metallicity. Specifically, the FMR predicts that galaxies, at\na given stellar mass, exhibit lower metallicities for higher SFRs. This trend\nis qualitatively consistent with observations of galaxy pairs, which have been\nrobustly shown to experience increasing gas-phase metallicity dilution and\nenhanced star formation activity with decreasing projected separation. In this\nwork, we show that, despite the qualitative consistency with FMR expectations,\nthe observed O/H dilution in galaxy pairs of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is\nstronger than what is predicted by the FMR.

Due to the limits of\nconstraining a training dataset to a small neighborhood, research on\nlocally-learned models has largely been restricted to simple model families.\nAlso, since simple model families have no complex structure by design, this has\nlimited use of the individual local models to predictive tasks. We hypothesize\nthat, using a sufficiently complex local model family, various properties of\nthe individual local models, such as their learned parameters, can be used as\nfeatures for further learning. This dissertation improves upon the current\nstate of research and works toward establishing this hypothesis by\ninvestigating algorithms for localization of more complex model families and by\nstudying their applications beyond predictions as a feature extraction\nmechanism. We summarize this generic technique of using local models as a\nfeature extraction step with the term ``local model feature transformations.''\nIn this document, we extend the local modeling paradigm to Gaussian processes,\northogonal quadric models and word embedding models, and extend the existing\ntheory for localized linear classifiers.

In the present studies we\nfirst clarify several subtle issues. In particular, we find that, out of the\nfive non-trivial field equations, only three are independent, so the problem is\nwell-posed, as now generically there are only three unknown functions, {$F(r),\nB(r), A(r)$, where $F$ and $B$ are metric coefficients, and $A$ describes the\naether field.} In addition, the two second-order differential equations for $A$\nand $F$ are independent of $B$, and once they are found, $B$ is given simply by\nan algebraic expression of $F,\\; A$ and their derivatives. To simplify the\nproblem further, we explore the symmetry of field redefinitions, and work first\nwith the redefined metric and aether field, and then obtain the physical ones\nby the inverse transformations. These clarifications significantly simplify the\ncomputational labor, which is important, as the problem is highly involved\nmathematically. In fact, it is exactly because of these, we find various\nnumerical BH solutions with an accuracy that is at least two orders higher than\nprevious ones.

To learn more discriminative feature representations of various\ndistorted SR images, the proposed DeepSRQ is a two-stream convolutional network\nincluding two subcomponents for distorted structure and texture SR images.\nDifferent from traditional image distortions, the artifacts of SR images cause\nboth image structure and texture quality degradation. Therefore, we choose the\ntwo-stream scheme that captures different properties of SR inputs instead of\ndirectly learning features from one image stream. Considering the human visual\nsystem (HVS) characteristics, the structure stream focuses on extracting\nfeatures in structural degradations, while the texture stream focuses on the\nchange in textural distributions. In addition, to augment the training data and\nensure the category balance, we propose a stride-based adaptive cropping\napproach for further improvement.

These instabilities play an active role\nin the evolution of space plasmas, as does ubiquitous broadband turbulence\ninduced by turbulent structures. This study compares certain properties of a\n2.5 dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation for the forward cascade of\nAlfvenic turbulence in a collisionless plasma against the same properties of\nturbulence observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission spacecraft in the\nterrestrial magnetosheath. The PIC\n  simulation is of decaying turbulence which develops both coherent structures\nand anisotropic ion velocity distributions with the potential to drive kinetic\nscale instabilities. The uniform background magnetic field points perpendicular\nto the plane of the simulation. Growth rates are computed from linear theory\nusing the ion temperature anisotropies and ion beta values for both the\nsimulation and the observations. Both the simulation and the observations show\nthat strong anisotropies and growth rates occur highly intermittently in the\nplasma, and the simulation further shows that such anisotropies preferentially\noccur near current sheets. This suggests that, though microinstabilities may\naffect the plasma globally , they act locally and develop in response to\nextreme temperature anisotropies generated by turbulent structures.

Team level statistics can\nalso be estimated from such analysis. This paper mainly focuses on some the\nchallenges and opportunities presented by sport video analysis in computer\nvision. Specifically, we use our multi-camera setup as a framework to discuss\nsome of the real-life challenges for machine learning algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 20:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

We show that this picture is intimately related to the\nnanoflare theory of the solar corona. First, we argue that due to stochastic\nflux freezing, a generalized version of flux freezing in turbulence, the\nmagnetic field follows the turbulent flow in a statistical sense. Bending and\nstretching an initially smooth field, therefore, the turbulence generally\nincreases the magnetic spatial complexity. Strong magnetic shears associated\nwith such a highly tangled field can trigger local reversals and field\nannihilations that convert magnetic energy into kinetic and thermal energy\nrespectively. The former maintains the turbulence, which incidentally continues\nto entangle the field completing the cycle, while the latter enhances the heat\ngeneration in the dissipative range. We support this theoretical picture\ninvoking recent analytical and numerical studies which suggest a correlation\nbetween magnetic complexity and magnetic energy dissipation. The amplification\nof multiple local, in-phase reversals by super-linear Richardson diffusion may\ninitiate a global reconnection at larger scales, however, even in the absence\nof such a global stochastic reconnection, the small scale reversals will\ncontinue to interact with the turbulence. We employ conventional scaling laws\nof MHD turbulence to illustrate that these local events are indeed efficient in\nboth enhancing the turbulence and generating heat.

While there have been a few lower bound results in the literature, we\nbelieve that this result is the first upper bound on the index of a\nself-shrinker. Our methods also give lower bounds on the index and the entropy,\nand our methods give simple formulas for two entropy-decreasing variations\nwhose existence was proved by Liu. Surprisingly, the eigenvalue corresponding\nto these variations is exactly $-1$. Finally, we present some preliminary\nresults in higher dimensions and six potential directions for future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 22:08:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 19:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

Since scientifically sound articles\nare identified through a multi-step process we proposed a novel cascade\nensemble analogous to the selection process. We compared the performance of the\ncascade ensemble with a single integrated model and other types of ensembles as\nwell as with results from previous studies.\n  Results: The cascade ensemble architecture achieved 0.7505 F measure, an\nimpressive 49.1% error rate reduction, compared to a CNN model that was\npreviously proposed and evaluated on a selected subset of the 50K articles.

In this paper, we introduce ExTru, a\nnovel encrypted communication protocol based on stream ciphers that adds a\nconfigurable switching & toggling network (CSTN) to not only boost the\nperformance of the communication in lightweight IoT devices, it also consumes\nfar less energy compared with the conventional side-channel resistant ciphers.\nAlthough the overall structure of the proposed scheme is leaky against physical\nattacks, such as side-channel or new scan-based Boolean satisfiability (SAT)\nattack or algebraic attack, we introduce a dynamic encryption mechanism that\nremoves this vulnerability.

Accordingly, since a specific\nnumber of messages, N, could break the communication and extract the key, by\nusing the dynamic encryption mechanism, ExTru can re-initiate the level of\ntrust periodically after T messages where T<N, to protect the communication\nagainst side-channel and scan-based attacks (e.g. SAT attack). Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that by properly configuring the value of T, ExTru not only\nincreases the strength of security from per \"device\" to per \"message\", it also\nsignificantly improves energy consumption as well as throughput in comparison\nwith an architecture that only uses a conventional side-channel resistant\nblock/stream cipher.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 23:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

We currently lack the ability to constrain emitted thermal\nradiation to arbitrary angular ranges over broad bandwidths. Here, we introduce\nand experimentally realize gradient epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) material structures\nthat enable broad spectrum directional control of thermal emission by\nsupporting leaky electromagnetic modes that couple to free space at fixed\nangles over a broad bandwidth.

Only the data acquisition unit still remains in the\nproduction lines. This distribution not only slims the ICT device, but also\npermits the share of the same functional units. At the second aspect, in the\ndata acquisition unit, sparse sampling strategy is adopted to reduce the raw\ndata and singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to compress these data.\nThey are then transmitted to the cloud storage.

Self-supervised approaches have demonstrated\nimpressive results but do not generalise to scenes with different depth ranges\nor camera baselines. In this paper, we introduce RealMonoDepth a\nself-supervised monocular depth estimation approach which learns to estimate\nthe real scene depth for a diverse range of indoor and outdoor scenes. A novel\nloss function with respect to the true scene depth based on relative depth\nscaling and warping is proposed. This allows self-supervised training of a\nsingle network with multiple data sets for scenes with diverse depth ranges\nfrom both stereo pair and in the wild moving camera data sets. A comprehensive\nperformance evaluation across five benchmark data sets demonstrates that\nRealMonoDepth provides a single trained network which generalises depth\nestimation across indoor and outdoor scenes, consistently outperforming\nprevious self-supervised approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 02:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

The basic idea of eCA-RSSR is to\nutilize visual information captured by the camera to estimate the incidence\nangles of visible lights first. Based on the incidence angles, eCA-RSSR\nutilizes the received signal strength ratio (RSSR) calculated by the photodiode\n(PD) to estimate the ratios of the distances between the LEDs and the receiver.\nBased on an Euclidean plane geometry theorem, eCA-RSSR transforms the ratios of\nthe distances into the absolute values. In this way, eCA-RSSR only requires 3\nLEDs for both orientation-free 2D and 3D positioning, implying that eCA-RSSR\ncan achieve high coverage. Based on the absolute values of the distances, the\nlinear least square method is employed to estimate the position of the\nreceiver. Therefore, for the receiver having a small distance between the PD\nand the camera, the accuracy of eCA-RSSR does not depend on the starting values\nof the non-linear least square method and the complexity of eCA-RSSR is low.\nFurthermore, since the distance between the PD and camera can significantly\naffect the performance of eCA-RSSR, we further propose a compensation algorithm\nfor eCA-RSSR based on the single-view geometry. Simulation results show that\neCA-RSSR can achieve centimeter-level accuracy over 80% indoor area for both\nthe receivers having a small and a large distance between the PD and the\ncamera.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 03:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

Traditionally, SpO$_2$ monitoring has been carried\nout using transmittance pulse oximeters due to its dependability. However,\nSpO$_2$ measurement from transmittance pulse oximeters is limited to peripheral\nregions. This becomes a disadvantage at very low temperatures as blood\nperfusion to the peripherals decreases. On the other hand, reflectance pulse\noximeters can be used at various sites like finger, wrist, chest and forehead.\nAdditionally, reflectance pulse oximeters can be scaled down to affordable\npatches that do not interfere with the user's diurnal activities.

Conventional schemes assume that the necessary\npacket exchanges occur in isolation, to avoid collisions. Concurrent ranging\nrelies on the overlapping of replies from nearby responders to the same ranging\nrequest issued by an initiator node. As UWB transmissions rely on short pulses,\nthe individual times of arrival can be discriminated by examining the channel\nimpulse response (CIR) of the initiator transceiver. By ranging against N\nresponders with a single, concurrent exchange, our technique drastically abates\nnetwork overhead, enabling higher ranging frequency with lower latency and\nenergy consumption w.r.t. conventional schemes.\n  Concurrent ranging can be implemented with a strawman approach requiring\nminimal changes to standard schemes. Nevertheless, we empirically show that\nthis limits the attainable accuracy, reliability, and therefore applicability.\nWe identify the main challenges in realizing concurrent ranging without\ndedicated hardware and tackle them by contributing several techniques, used in\nsynergy in our prototype based on the popular DW1000 transceiver. Our\nevaluation, with static targets and a mobile robot, confirms that concurrent\nranging reliably achieves decimeter-level distance and position accuracy,\ncomparable to conventional schemes but at a fraction of the network and energy\ncost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 07:06:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 07:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

The boundary charge is\nfully determined by bulk properties indicating a bulk-boundary correspondence.\nIn a large parameter regime it agrees with the one obtained from an effective\nlow-energy theory (arXiv:2004.00463). Secondly, we investigate the robustness\nof our results towards two-particle interactions. To resum the series of\nleading logarithms for small gaps, which dismantle plain perturbation theory in\nthe interaction, we use an essentially analytical renormalization group\napproach. It is controlled for small interactions and can directly be applied\nto the microscopic lattice model. We benchmark the results against numerical\ndensity matrix renormalization group data. The main interaction effect in the\nbulk is a power-law renormalization of the gap with an interaction dependent\nexponent. The important characteristics of the boundary charge are unaltered\nand can be understood from the renormalized bulk properties, elevating the\nbulk-boundary correspondence to the interacting regime. This requires a\nconsistent treatment not only of the low-energy gap renormalization but also of\nthe high-energy band width one. In contrast to low-energy field theories our\nrenormalization group approach also provides the latter.

This study aims at realizing secure AirComp-based FL against\nvarious privacy attacks where malicious central servers infer clients' private\ndata from aggregated global models. To this end, a differentially private\nAirComp-based FL is designed in this study, where the key idea is to harness\nreceiver noise perturbation injected to aggregated global models inherently,\nthereby preventing the inference of clients' private data. However, the\nvariance of the inherent receiver noise is often uncontrollable, which renders\nthe process of injecting an appropriate noise perturbation to achieve a desired\nprivacy level quite challenging. Hence, this study designs transmit power\ncontrol across clients, wherein the received signal level is adjusted\nintentionally to control the noise perturbation levels effectively, thereby\nachieving the desired privacy level. It is observed that a higher privacy level\nrequires lower transmit power, which indicates the tradeoff between the privacy\nlevel and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To understand this tradeoff more fully,\nthe closed-form expressions of SNR (with respect to the privacy level) are\nderived, and the tradeoff is analytically demonstrated. The analytical results\nalso demonstrate that among the configurable parameters, the number of\nparticipating clients is a key parameter that enhances the received SNR under\nthe aforementioned tradeoff.

However, two important questions remain largely unanswered: first,\nhow well can the trained neural network generalize to objects very different\nfrom the ones in training? This is particularly important in practice, since\nlarge-scale annotated examples similar to those of interest are often not\navailable during training. Second, has the trained neural network learnt the\nunderlying (inverse) physics model, or has it merely done something trivial,\nsuch as memorizing the examples or point-wise pattern matching? This pertains\nto the interpretability of machine-learning based algorithms. In this work, we\nuse the Phase Extraction Neural Network (PhENN), a deep neural network (DNN)\nfor quantitative phase retrieval in a lensless phase imaging system as the\nstandard platform and show that the two questions are related and share a\ncommon crux: the choice of the training examples. Moreover, we connect the\nstrength of the regularization effect imposed by a training set to the training\nprocess with the Shannon entropy of images in the dataset. That is, the higher\nthe entropy of the training images, the weaker the regularization effect can be\nimposed. We also discover that weaker regularization effect leads to better\nlearning of the underlying propagation model, i.e. the weak object transfer\nfunction, applicable for weakly scattering objects under the weak object\napproximation. Finally, simulation and experimental results show that better\ncross-domain generalization performance can be achieved if DNN is trained on a\nhigher-entropy database, e.g. the ImageNet, than if the same DNN is trained on\na lower-entropy database, e.g. MNIST, as the former allows the underlying\nphysics model be learned better than the latter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 08:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

The high-resolving power of the FRS\nspectrometer allows us to obtain $(p, n)$-type isobaric charge-exchange cross\nsections with an uncertainty of $3.5\\%$ and to separate quasi-elastic and\ninelastic components in the missing-energy spectra of the ejectiles. The\ninelastic component is associated to the excitation of the $\\Delta$(1232)\nisobar resonance and the emission of pions in s-wave both in the target and\nprojectile nucleus, while the quasi-elastic contribution is associated to the\nnuclear spin-isospin response of nucleon-hole excitations.

A great deal of research effort over this time has been invested\ninto the development of front-end representations tailored to the spoofing\ndetection task. One such approach known as constant Q cepstral coefficients\n(CQCCs) have been shown to be especially effective in detecting attacks\nimplemented with a unit selection based speech synthesis algorithm. Despite\ntheir success, they largely fail in detecting other forms of spoofing attack\nwhere more traditional front-end representations give substantially better\nresults. Similar differences were also observed in the most recent, 2019\nedition of the ASVspoof challenge series. This paper reports our attempts to\nhelp explain these observations. The explanation is shown to lie in the level\nof attention paid by each front-end to different sub-band components of the\nspectrum. Thus far, surprisingly little has been learned about what artefacts\nare being detected by spoofing countermeasures. Our work hence aims to shed\nlight upon signal or spectrum level artefacts that serve to distinguish\ndifferent forms of spoofing attack from genuine, bone fide speech. With a\nbetter understanding of these artefacts we will be better positioned to design\nmore reliable countermeasures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 11:16:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 13:03:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2020 13:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

A neutrally buoyant, initially concentric\ncompound drop is released into a fully developed flow, where it migrates to its\nequilibrium position. Based on the results, we find that the core-shell\ninteraction affects the dynamics of both the core and the compound drop. During\nthe initial transient period, the core revolves about the center of the\ncompound drop due to the internal circulation inside the shell. At equilibrium,\ndepending upon the nature of the flow field inside the shell, we identify two\ndistinct core behaviors: stable state and limit-cycle state. In the stable\nstate, the core stops revolving and moves outward very slowly. The core in the\nlimit-cycle state continues to revolve in a nearly fixed orbit with no further\ninward motion. We also find that the migration of the compound drop affects the\neccentricity of the core significantly. A comparison with the simple drop\nreveals that the core enhances the deformation of the compound drop. The\noutward moving core in stable state pushes the compound drop towards the walls,\nand the revolving core in limit-cycle state makes the compound drop to\noscillate at its equilibrium position.

To solve the problem of ignoring low-frequency\nneeds, we propose a dynamic association mechanism to expand the receptive field\nbased on external knowledge, which can obtain associated words to be added to\nthe input. These associated words can serve as bridges to transfer the ability\nof the model from the familiar high-frequency words to the unfamiliar\nlow-frequency words.

Another example is\nreproduction, where eggs release pheromones that attract sperm. A macro scale\nexample is flower scent appealing to pollinators.

Using suitably defined non-degenerate\ninvariant forms we show that Takiff superalgebras give rise to families of\nconformal field theories with central charge c=p sdim(g).

This situation seems to produce a social dilemma: players want to hide\nbehind others, whereas if a group of players attempts to do so, they may all\nlose to other players that overtake them. To support that speed skaters are\ninvolved in such a social dilemma, we analyzed video footage data for 14 mass\nstart skating races to find that skaters that hid behind others to avoid air\nresistance for a long time before the final lap tended to win.

The majority of\nthe existing algorithms for the IM problem are developed only under the\nnon-adaptive setting, i.e., where all $k$ seed nodes are selected in one batch\nwithout observing how they influence other users in real world. In this paper,\nwe study the adaptive IM problem where the $k$ seed nodes are selected in\nbatches of equal size $b$, such that the $i$-th batch is identified after the\nactual influence results of the former $i-1$ batches are observed.

Many such bounds on different\nfamilies of sets over different classes of graphs are already provided in the\nliterature.

Such multi-state models have a wide range of applications for\nmodelling complex courses of a disease over the course of time, but the Markov\nassumption may often be in doubt. If censoring is entirely unrelated to the\nmulti-state data, it has been noted that the Aalen-Johansen estimator,\nstandardized by the initial empirical distribution of the multi-state model,\nstill consistently estimates the state occupation probabilities. Recently, this\nresult has been extended to transition probabilities using landmarking, which\nis, inter alia, useful for dynamic prediction. We complement these results in\nthree ways. Firstly, delayed study entry is a common phenomenon in\nobservational studies, and we extend the earlier results to multi-state data\nalso subject to left-truncation. Secondly, we present a rigorous proof of\nconsistency of the Aalen-Johansen estimator for state occupation probabilities,\non which also correctness of the landmarking approach hinges, correcting,\nsimplifying and extending the earlier result.

We choose the coevolving voter model as a prototype\nframework for this problem. By numerical simulations and analytical\napproximations we find three main phases that differ in the absolute\nmagnetization and the size of the largest component: a consensus phase, a\ncoexistence phase, and a dynamical fragmentation phase. More detailed analysis\nreveals inner differences in these phases, allowing us to divide two of them\nfurther. In the consensus phase we can distinguish between a weak or\nalternating consensus (switching between two opposite consensus states), and a\nstrong consensus, in which the system remains in the same state for the whole\nrealization of the stochastic dynamics. Additionally, weak and strong consensus\nphases scale differently with the system size. The strong consensus phase\nexists for superlinear interactions and it is the only consensus phase that\nsurvives in the thermodynamic limit. In the coexistence phase we distinguish a\nfully-mixing phase (both states well mixed in the network) and a structured\ncoexistence phase, where the number of links connecting nodes in different\nstates (active links) drops significantly due to the formation of two\nhomogeneous communities of opposite states connected by a few links. The\nstructured coexistence phase is an example of emergence of community structure\nfrom not exclusively topological dynamics, but coevolution. Our numerical\nobservations are supported by an analytical description using a pair\napproximation approach and an ad-hoc calculation for the transition between the\ncoexistence and dynamical fragmentation phases. Our work shows how simple\ninteraction rules including the joint effect of non-linearity, noise, and\ncoevolution lead to complex structures relevant in the description of social\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 13:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-28"}

We explore this scenario simulating the radio lightcurves of\ntransits of hot-Jupiters, Kepler-17b and WASP-12b, around solar-like stars. We\ncalculated the bremsstrahlung radio emission at 17, 100, and 400 GHz originated\nfrom the star, considering a solar atmospheric model. The planetary radio\nemission was calculated modelling the planets in two scenarios: as a blackbody\nor with a dense and hot extended atmosphere. In both cases the planet radiates\nand contributes to the total radio flux. For a blackbody planet, the transit\ndepth is in the order of 2-4% and it is independent of the radio frequency.\nHot-Jupiters planets with atmospheres appear bigger and brighter in radio, thus\nhaving a larger contribution to the total flux of the system. Therefore, the\ntransit depths are larger than in the case of blackbody planets, reaching up to\n8% at 17 GHz. Also the transit depth is frequency-dependent. Moreover, the\ntransit caused by the planet passing behind the star is deeper than when the\nplanet transits in front of the star, being as large as 18% at 400GHz. In all\ncases, the contribution of the planetary radio emission to the observed flux is\nevident when the planet transits behind the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 14:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

In this\ncontext, Evolutionary Multitasking addresses this paradigm by resorting to\nconcepts from Evolutionary Computation. Within this specific branch, approaches\nsuch as the Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) has lately gained a\nnotable momentum when tackling multiple optimization tasks.

Four different pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN)- AlexNet, ResNet18, DenseNet201, and SqueezeNet were used for\ntransfer learning. 5247 Bacterial, viral and normal chest x-rays images\nunderwent preprocessing techniques and the modified images were trained for the\ntransfer learning based classification task. In this work, the authors have\nreported three schemes of classifications: normal vs pneumonia, bacterial vs\nviral pneumonia and normal, bacterial and viral pneumonia. The classification\naccuracy of normal and pneumonia images, bacterial and viral pneumonia images,\nand normal, bacterial and viral pneumonia were 98%, 95%, and 93.3%\nrespectively. This is the highest accuracy in any scheme than the accuracies\nreported in the literature. Therefore, the proposed study can be useful in\nfaster-diagnosing pneumonia by the radiologist and can help in the fast airport\nscreening of pneumonia patients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 15:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-08"}

The goal is to achieve a perfectly closed, 1\npixel wide and detailed object contour, since this type of contour could be\nanalyzed using methods such as Fourier descriptors. Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) are rarely used for contour tracing. However, we find CNNs are\ntailor-made for this task and that's why we present the Walk the Lines (WtL)\nalgorithm, a standard regression CNN trained to follow object contours. To make\nthe first step, we train the CNN only on ship contours, but the principle is\nalso applicable to other objects. Input data are the image and the associated\nobject contour prediction of the recently published RefineContourNet. The WtL\ngets a center pixel, which defines an input section and an angle for rotating\nthis section. Ideally, the center pixel moves on the contour, while the angle\ndescribes upcoming directional contour changes. The WtL predicts its steps\npixelwise in a selfrouting way. To obtain a complete object contour the WtL\nruns in parallel at different image locations and the traces of its individual\npaths are summed. In contrast to the comparable Non-Maximum Suppression method,\nour approach produces connected contours with finer details. Finally, the\nobject contour is binarized under the condition of being closed. In case all\nprocedures work as desired, excellent ship segmentations with high IoUs are\nproduced, showing details such as antennas and ship superstructures that are\neasily omitted by other segmentation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 15:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

The other is called learning-based waveform, where the multiuser\nwaveform is partially or even completely designed by deep learning algorithms.\nSpecifically, if the information-bearing symbols are directly embedded in the\nwaveform, it is called systematic waveform. Otherwise, it is called\nnon-systematic waveform, where no artificial design is involved. Simulation\nresults show that the pilot-aided waveform design outperforms the conventional\nzero forcing receiver with least squares (LS) channel estimation on small-size\nMU-MIMO systems. By exploiting the time-domain degrees of freedom (DoF), the\nlearning-based waveform design further improves the detection performance by at\nleast 5 dB at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range. Moreover, it is found\nthat the traditional weight initialization method might cause a training\nimbalance among different users in the learning-based waveform design. To\ntackle this issue, a novel weight initialization method is proposed which\nprovides a balanced convergence performance with no complexity penalty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 15:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

Recently, a lot of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based\nimage-to-image translation methods for single line art colorization have\nemerged. They can generate perceptually appealing results conditioned on line\nart images. However, these methods can not be adopted for the purpose of\nanimation colorization because there is a lack of consideration of the\nin-between frame consistency. Existing methods simply input the previous\ncolored frame as a reference to color the next line art, which will mislead the\ncolorization due to the spatial misalignment of the previous colored frame and\nthe next line art especially at positions where apparent changes happen. To\naddress these challenges, we design a kind of correlation matching feature\ntransfer model (called CMFT) to align the colored reference feature in a\nlearnable way and integrate the model into an U-Net based generator in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner. This enables the generator to transfer the layer-wise\nsynchronized features from the deep semantic code to the content progressively.\nExtension evaluation shows that CMFT model can effectively improve the\nin-between consistency and the quality of colored frames especially when the\nmotion is intense and diverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 06:50:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 13:21:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 09:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

These software libraries come pre-loaded with a variety of network\narchitectures, provide autodifferentiation, and support GPUs for fast and\nefficient computation. As a result, a deep learning practitioner will favor\ntraining a neural network model in Python, where these tools are readily\navailable. However, many large-scale scientific computation projects are\nwritten in Fortran, making it difficult to integrate with modern deep learning\nmethods. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a software library, the\nFortran-Keras Bridge (FKB). This two-way bridge connects environments where\ndeep learning resources are plentiful, with those where they are scarce. The\npaper describes several unique features offered by FKB, such as customizable\nlayers, loss functions, and network ensembles.\n  The paper concludes with a case study that applies FKB to address open\nquestions about the robustness of an experimental approach to global climate\nsimulation, in which subgrid physics are outsourced to deep neural network\nemulators. In this context, FKB enables a hyperparameter search of one hundred\nplus candidate models of subgrid cloud and radiation physics, initially\nimplemented in Keras, to be transferred and used in Fortran. Such a process\nallows the model's emergent behavior to be assessed, i.e. when fit\nimperfections are coupled to explicit planetary-scale fluid dynamics. The\nresults reveal a previously unrecognized strong relationship between offline\nvalidation error and online performance, in which the choice of optimizer\nproves unexpectedly critical.
