In\nthis work, we contribute the first high-quality object detection dataset for\nsecurity inspection, named Occluded Prohibited Items X-ray (OPIXray) image\nbenchmark. OPIXray focused on the widely-occurred prohibited item \"cutter\",\nannotated manually by professional inspectors from the international airport.\nThe test set is further divided into three occlusion levels to better\nunderstand the performance of detectors.

While\nblockchain brings a wide variety of benefits, it also imposes certain\nchallenges. Therefore, the objective of this research is to understand the\nproperties of blockchain, its current uses, observed benefits and pitfalls to\nprovide a balanced understanding of blockchain. A systematic literature review\napproach was adopted in this paper in order to attain the objective. A total of\n51 articles were selected and reviewed. As outcomes, this research provides a\nsummary of the state-of-the-art research studies conducted in the area of\nblockchain. Furthermore, we develop a set of concept maps aiming to provide\nin-depth knowledge on blockchain technology for its efficient and effective\nusage in the development of future technological solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 2020 17:43:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 15:17:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

On the one hand,\ndeclarative languages and reasoning algorithms well support representing and\nreasoning with commonsense knowledge. But these algorithms are not good at\nplanning actions toward maximizing cumulative reward over a long, unspecified\nhorizon. On the other hand, probabilistic planning frameworks, such as Markov\ndecision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs), well support\nplanning to achieve long-term goals under uncertainty. But they are\nill-equipped to represent or reason about knowledge that is not directly\nrelated to actions.\n  In this article, we present a novel algorithm, called iCORPP, to\nsimultaneously estimate the current world state, reason about world dynamics,\nand construct task-oriented controllers. In this process, robot decision-making\nproblems are decomposed into two interdependent (smaller) subproblems that\nfocus on reasoning to \"understand the world\" and planning to \"achieve the goal\"\nrespectively. Contextual knowledge is represented in the reasoning component,\nwhich makes the planning component epistemic and enables active information\ngathering. The developed algorithm has been implemented and evaluated both in\nsimulation and on real robots using everyday service tasks, such as indoor\nnavigation, dialog management, and object delivery. Results show significant\nimprovements in scalability, efficiency, and adaptiveness, compared to\ncompetitive baselines including handcrafted action policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 2020 17:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

Following an initial calibration,\nthe ring temperature can be determined by recognizing the spectral resonance\npattern, and as a consequence the wavelength of every resonance is also known.\nTwo methods of pattern based temperature retrieval are presented.

Indeed, integrable models display periodic revivals manifested in a\ndip in the block entanglement entropy in a finite system.

It involves a 'law of\nmotion' for crack-tips, primarily as a kinematical consequence coupled with\nthermodynamics. Fundamental kinematics endows the crack-tip with a topological\ncharge. This allows the association of a kinematical conservation law for the\ncharge, resulting in a fundamental evolution equation for the crack-tip field,\nand in turn the crack field. The vectorial crack field degrades the elastic\nmodulus in a physically justified anisotropic manner. The mathematical\nstructure of this conservation law allows an additive 'free' gradient of a\nscalar field in the evolution of the crack field. We associate this naturally\nemerging scalar field with the porosity that arises in the modeling of ductile\nfailure. Thus, porosity-rate gradients affect the evolution of the crack-field\nwhich, then, naturally degrades the elastic modulus, and it is through this\nfundamental mechanism that spatial gradients in porosity growth affects the\nstrain-energy density and stress carrying capacity of the material - and, as a\ndimensional consequence related to fundamental kinematics, introduces a\nlength-scale in the model. The key hypothesis of this work is that brittle\nfracture is energy-driven while ductile fracture is stress-driven; under\noverall shear loadings where mean stress vanishes or is compressive, shear\nstrain energy can still drive shear fracture in ductile materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 2020 21:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

In principle, a more accurate approach is\nprovided by quantum mechanical density functional theory (DFT) scoring, but\neven with approximations, this has yet to become practical on drug\ndiscovery-relevant timescales and resources. Here, we describe how to overcome\nthis barrier using algorithms for DFT calculations that scale on widely\navailable cloud architectures, enabling full density functional theory, without\napproximations, to be applied to protein-ligand complexes with approximately\n2500 atoms in tens of minutes. Applying this to a realistic example of 22\nligands binding to MCL1 reveals that density functional scoring outperforms\nclassical free energy perturbation theory for this system. This raises the\npossibility of broadly applying fully quantum mechanical scoring to real-world\ndrug discovery pipelines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 2020 22:59:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

The proposed DAC is based on RF\nfingerprinting, information theoretic method, feature learning, and\ndiscriminatory power of deep learning. Specifically, an autoencoder is used to\nautomatically extract features from the RF traces, and the reconstruction error\nis used as the DAC and this DAC is unique to the device and the particular\nmessage of interest. Then Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test is used to match the\ndistribution of the reconstruction error generated by the autoencoder and the\nreceived message, and the result will determine whether the device of interest\nbelongs to an authorized user.

While architecture and objective function design choices have received\nattention, the choice of pretraining datasets has received little attention. In\nthis work, we question some of the default choices made in literature. For\ninstance, we systematically study how varying similarity between the\npretraining dataset domain (textual and visual) and the downstream domain\naffects performance. Surprisingly, we show that automatically generated data in\na domain closer to the downstream task (e.g., VQA v2) is a better choice for\npretraining than \"natural\" data but of a slightly different domain (e.g.,\nConceptual Captions).

In this paper, we propose a principled metric for 3D object\ndetection specifically for the task of self-driving. The core idea behind our\nmetric is to isolate the task of object detection and measure the impact the\nproduced detections would induce on the downstream task of driving.

As a result, people\nincreasingly rely on information obtained from sensors to make decisions in\ntheir daily life. Unfortunately, in most sensing applications, sensors are\nknown to be error-prone and their measurements can become misleading at any\nunexpected time. Therefore, in order to enhance the reliability of sensing\napplications, apart from the physical phenomena/processes of interest, we\nbelieve it is also highly important to monitor the reliability of sensors and\nclean the sensor data before analysis on them being conducted. Existing studies\noften regard sensor reliability monitoring and sensor data cleaning as separate\nproblems.

Considering that light QCD axions, as opposed to axions $>1$eV,\nmay travel a long range before they decay into gamma rays, neutron stars may\nappear as a spatially-extended source of gamma rays. We extend our previous\nsearch for gamma rays from axions, based on a point source model, to consider\nthe neutron star as an extended source of gamma rays.

However, their impact on disk accretion is not yet well quantified. Here\nwe identify systematic biases in retrieving the true launch zone, magnetic\nlever arm, and angular momentum flux of an MHD DW from apparent rotation\nsignatures. Synthetic position-velocity cuts are constructed from self-similar\nMHD DWs over a broad range of parameters, and three different methods are\napplied for estimating the specific angular momentum. We find that the launch\nradius inferred using the well-known relation from Anderson et al. (2006) can\nmarkedly differ from the true outermost launch radius $r_{out}$ of the DW. The\n\"double-peak separation\" and \"flow width\" methods provide only a strict lower\nlimit to $r_{out}$. This bias is independent of angular resolution and can\nreach a factor ten. In contrast, the \"rotation curve\" method gives a good\nestimate of $r_{out}$ when the flow is well resolved, and an upper limit\notherwise. The magnetic lever arm is always underestimated. Only comparison\nwith synthetic predictions can take into account properly all observational\neffects. As an application, we present a comparison with ALMA observations of\nHH212 at resolutions from 250 au to 16 au, which represents the most stringent\nobservational test of MHD DW to date. This comparison confirms our predicted\nbiases for the double-peak separation method, and the large $r_{out}\\sim40~$au\nand small magnetic lever arm first suggested by Tabone et al. (2017). We also\nderive the first accurate analytical expression for the fraction of disk\nangular momentum extracted by an MHD disk wind of given radial extent, magnetic\nlever arm, and mass flux. Application to HH212 confirms that MHD DWs are\nserious candidates for the steady angular momentum extraction process in young\ndisks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2020 10:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

The images analyzed\nhere were taken with 8, 10, 13, and 15 epochs over three years in the $g$, $r$,\n$i$, and $z$ bands, respectively. We identified 491 robust variable AGN\ncandidates, down to $i=25$ mag and with redshift up to $4.26$. Ninety percent\nof the variability-selected AGNs are individually identified with the X-ray\nsources detected in the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey. We investigate their\nproperties in variability by using structure function analysis and find that\nthe structure function for low-luminosity AGNs\n($L_{\\mathrm{bol}}\\lesssim10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) shows a positive correlation\nwith luminosity, which is the opposite trend for the luminous quasars. This\ntrend is likely to be caused by larger contribution of the host galaxy light\nfor lower-luminosity AGNs. Using the model templates of galaxy spectra, we\nevaluate the amount of host galaxy contribution to the structure function\nanalysis and find that dominance of the young stellar population is needed to\nexplain the observed luminosity dependence. This suggests that low-luminosity\nAGNs at $0.8\\lesssim z\\lesssim1.8$ are predominantly hosted in star-forming\ngalaxies. The X-ray stacking analysis reveals the significant emission from the\nindividually X-ray undetected AGNs in our variability-selected sample.

We solved an approximate coagulation equation of dust grains\nwith time-evolving disks that consist of both gas and solid components by a\none-dimensional model. With the grain growth, all solid particles initially\ndrift inward toward the central star by the gas drag force. However, the radial\nprofile of gas pressure, $P$, is modified by the MDW that disperses the gas in\nan inside-out manner. Consequently, a local concentration of solid particles is\ncreated by the converging radial flux of drifting dust grains at the location\nwith the convex upward profile of $P$. When the dimensionless stopping time,\n${\\rm St}$, there exceeds unity, the solid particles spontaneously reach the\ngrowth dominated state because of the positive feedback between the suppressed\nradial drift and the enhanced accumulation of dust particles that drift from\nthe outer part.

Recent investigations in channel and Couette\nflow, suggest that these large-scale motions are self-sustained, implying they\nare not driven by small-scale motions at the wall. Whether large-scale motions\nare self-sustained has however not yet been answered for open boundary layers,\nwhich are relevant for many applications. Here, using the asymptotic suction\nboundary layer flow at the friction Reynolds number $Re_\\tau = 1\\,168$ as a\ntestbed, we show that large-scale motions are self-sustained also in boundary\nlayers.

RANS models\nare predicated on the solution of the RANS equations, but these equations\ninvolve an unclosed term, the Reynolds stress tensor, which must be modeled.\nThe Reynolds stress tensor is often modeled as an algebraic function of mean\nflow field variables and turbulence variables. This introduces a discrepancy\nbetween the Reynolds stress tensor predicted by the model and the exact\nReynolds stress tensor. This discrepancy can result in inaccurate mean flow\nfield predictions. In this paper, we introduce a data-informed approach for\narriving at Reynolds stress models with improved predictive performance.

Our greedy method is based on\nextending the low-rank approximation pursuit (LRAP) method for matrix\ncompletions to tensor completions. The method performs a tensor factorization\nusing the tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) which extends the\nstandard matrix SVD to tensors. The t-SVD leads to a notion of rank, called\ntubal-rank here. We want to recreate the data in tensors from low resolution\nsamples as best we can here. To complete a low resolution tensor successfully\nwe assume that the given tensor data has low tubal-rank. For tensors of low\ntubal-rank, we establish convergence results for our method that are based on\nthe tensor restricted isometry property (TRIP). Our result with the TRIP\ncondition for tensors is similar to low-rank matrix completions under the RIP\ncondition. The TRIP condition uses the t-SVD for low tubal-rank tensors, while\nRIP uses the SVD for matrices. We show that a subgaussian measurement map\nsatisfies the TRIP condition with high probability and gives an almost optimal\nbound on the number of required measurements.

We\nconsider that the transmitter is only provided by a $b$-bits feedback of the\nmain channel state information (CSI) sent by each legitimate receiver, at the\nbeginning of each fading block, over error-free public links with limited\ncapacity. Also, we assume that the transmitter is aware of the statistics of\nthe eavesdropper's CSI but not of its channel's realizations.

In all three scenarios, we show that as long\nas the transmitter has some knowledge of the main CSI, obtained even through a\n1-bit CSI feedback, a non-zero secrecy rate can still be achieved.
