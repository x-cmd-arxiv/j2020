It is useful for multi-modal data analysis.\nTraditional domain adaptation algorithms assume that the representations of\nsource and target samples reside in the same feature space, hence are likely to\nfail in solving the heterogeneous domain adaptation problem. Contemporary\nstate-of-the-art HDA approaches are usually composed of complex optimization\nobjectives for favourable performance and are therefore computationally\nexpensive and less generalizable. To address these issues, we propose a novel\nCross-Domain Structure Preserving Projection (CDSPP) algorithm for HDA. As an\nextension of the classic LPP to heterogeneous domains, CDSPP aims to learn\ndomain-specific projections to map sample features from source and target\ndomains into a common subspace such that the class consistency is preserved and\ndata distributions are sufficiently aligned. CDSPP is simple and has\ndeterministic solutions by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem.

One type of manipulation that we examine in this\npaper is the splice attack where a region from one image (or the same image) is\ninserted (spliced) into an image. In this paper, we present a one-class\ndetection method based on deep belief networks (DBN) for splicing detection and\nlocalization without using any prior knowledge of the manipulations. We\nevaluate the performance of our approach and show that it provides good\ndetection and localization accuracies in small forgeries compared to other\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 17:35:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

Toward this end, we present Airmed - a method and\nsystem to not just detect corruption of the application software on a IoT node,\nbut to self correct itself using its neighbors. Airmed's decentralized\nmechanisms prevent the spread of self-propagating malware and can also be used\nas a technique for updating application code on such IoT devices. Among the\nnovelties of Airmed are a novel bloom-filter technique along with hardware\nsupport to identify position of the malware program from the benign application\ncode, an adaptive self-check for computational efficiency, and a uniform\nrandom-backoff and stream signatures for secure and bandwidth efficient code\nexchange to correct corrupted devices. We assess the performance of Airmed,\nusing the embedded systems security architecture of TrustLite in the OMNeT++\nsimulator.

In particular, it is not fully\nunderstood how plasticity induced changes in the network affect balance, and in\nturn, how correlated, balanced activity impacts learning. How does the dynamics\nof balanced networks change under different plasticity rules? How does\ncorrelated spiking activity in recurrent networks change the evolution of\nweights, their eventual magnitude, and structure across the network?

The first step is a\npreprocessing algorithm that reduces the size of secret images without losing\ninformation. This results in improved stego image quality compared to other\nexisting image steganography methods. The proposed secret image size reduction\n(SISR) algorithm is an efficient spatial domain technique. The second step is\nan embedding mechanism that relies on Fibonacci representation of pixel\nintensities to minimize the effect of embedding on the stego image quality. The\nimprovement is attained by using bit-plane(s) mapping instead of bit-plane(s)\nreplacement for embedding. The proposed embedding mechanism outperforms the\nbinary based LSB randomly embedding in two ways: reduced effect on stego\nquality and increased robustness against statistical steganalysers.\nExperimental results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed scheme in terms\nof: 1) SISR ratio (indirectly results in increased capacity); 2) quality of the\nstego; and 3) robustness against steganalysers such as RS, and WS. Furthermore,\nexperimental results show that the proposed SISR algorithm can be extended to\nbe applicable on DICOM standard medical images.

To that end, lightweight feedstock for printing syntactic foam\ncomposites is developed. The blend for this is prepared by varying GMB content\n(20, 40, and 60 volume %) in HDPE for filament extrusion, which is subsequently\nused for three-dimensional printing (3DP). The rheological properties and the\nmelt flow index (MFI) of blends are investigated for identifying suitable\nprinting parameters. It is observed that the storage and loss modulus, as well\nas complex viscosity, increases with increasing GMB content, whereas MFI\ndecreases. Further, the coefficient of thermal expansion of HDPE and foam\nfilaments decreases with increasing GMB content, thereby lowering the thermal\nstresses in prints, which promotes the reduction in warpage. The mechanical\nproperties of filaments are determined by subjecting them to tensile tests,\nwhereas 3D printed samples are tested under tensile and flexure tests. The\ntensile modulus of the filament increases with increasing GMB content (8-47%)\nas compared to HDPE and exhibit comparable filament strength. 3D printed foams\nshow higher specific tensile and flexural modulus as compared to neat HDPE,\nmaking them suitable candidate materials for weight sensitive applications.\nHDPE having 60% by volume GMB exhibited the highest modulus and is 48.02%\nhigher than the printed HDPE. Finally, the property map reveals higher modulus\nand comparable strength against injection and compression molded foams. Printed\nfoam registered 1.8 times higher modulus than molded samples.

Xue et al.\n(Nat. Commun., vol. 8, 2017, pp. 1-6) showed that the injection velocity of\nexpresso determines the depth of coffee-milk mixture. After a while when a\nstable stratification forms in the mixture, the layering process can be\nmodelled as a double diffusive convection system with a stably-stratified\ncoffee-milk mixture cooled from the side. More specifically, we perform\n(two-dimensional) direct numerical simulations of laterally cooled double\ndiffusive convection for a wide parameter range, where the convective flow is\ndriven by a lateral temperature gradient while stabilized by a vertical\nconcentration gradient. When the thermal driving force dominates over the\nstabilizing force, the flow behaves like vertical convection in which a\nlarge-scale circulation develops. However, with increasing strength of the\nstabilizing force, a meta-stable layered regime emerges. Initially, several\nvertically-stacked convection rolls develop, and these well-mixed layers are\nseparated by sharp interfaces with large concentration gradients. The initial\nthickness of these emerging layers can be estimated by balancing the work\nexerted by thermal driving and the required potential energy to bring fluid out\nof its equilibrium position in the stably stratified fluid. In the layered\nregime, we further observe successive layer merging, and eventually only a\nsingle convection roll remains. We elucidate the following merging mechanism:\nAs weakened circulation leads to accumulation of hot fluid adjacent to the hot\nsidewall, larger buoyancy forces associated with hotter fluid eventually break\nthe layer interface. Then two layers merge into a larger layer, and circulation\nestablishes again within the merged structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 21:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

We study the problem of order preserving hierarchical clustering of this\nkind of ordered data. That is, if we have $a < b$ in the original data and\ndenote their respective clusters by $[a]$ and $[b]$, then we shall have $[a] <\n[b]$ in the produced clustering. The clustering is similarity based and uses\nstandard linkage functions, such as single- and complete linkage, and is an\nextension of classical hierarchical clustering.\n  To achieve this, we define the output from running classical hierarchical\nclustering on strictly ordered data to be partial dendrograms; sub-trees of\nclassical dendrograms with several connected components. We then construct an\nembedding of partial dendrograms over a set into the family of ultrametrics\nover the same set. An optimal hierarchical clustering is defined as the partial\ndendrogram corresponding to the ultrametric closest to the original\ndissimilarity measure, measured in the p-norm. Thus, the method is a\ncombination of classical hierarchical clustering and ultrametric fitting.\n  A reference implementation is employed for experiments on both synthetic\nrandom data and real world data from a database of machine parts.

We provide a lower bound on the magnitude\nof bias due to interference by conducting a meta-experiment that randomizes\nover two experiment designs: one Bernoulli randomized, one cluster randomized.\nIn both meta-experiment arms, treatment sellers are subject to a different\nplatform fee policy than control sellers, resulting in different prices for\nbuyers.

Classical MIMO detection techniques consider unquantized\nobservations, and many of them are not applicable to the one-bit MIMO case. We\ndevelop a new non-convex optimization algorithm for the one-bit ML MIMO\ndetection problem, using a strategy called homotopy optimization.

The MSE is decomposed in tracking variance and bias and\nnovel and efficient procedures to estimate these quantities are presented. It\nis shown that estimation bias can be tracked by associating it with the portion\nof observations below the quantile estimates.\n  The first procedure runs an ensemble of $L$ quantile estimators for wide\nrange of values of the tuning parameters and typically around $L = 100$. In\neach iteration an oracle selects the best estimate by the guidance of the\nestimated MSEs. The second method only runs an ensemble of $L = 3$ estimators\nand thus the values of the tuning parameters need from time to time to be\nadjusted for the running estimators.

However, robust and accurate screening of\nCOVID-19 from chest X-rays is still a globally recognized challenge because of\ntwo bottlenecks: 1) imaging features of COVID-19 share some similarities with\nother pneumonia on chest X-rays, and 2) the misdiagnosis rate of COVID-19 is\nvery high, and the misdiagnosis cost is expensive. While a few pioneering works\nhave made much progress, they underestimate both crucial bottlenecks. In this\npaper, we report our solution, discriminative cost-sensitive learning (DCSL),\nwhich should be the choice if the clinical needs the assisted screening of\nCOVID-19 from chest X-rays. DCSL combines both advantages from fine-grained\nclassification and cost-sensitive learning. Firstly, DCSL develops a\nconditional center loss that learns deep discriminative representation.\nSecondly, DCSL establishes score-level cost-sensitive learning that can\nadaptively enlarge the cost of misclassifying COVID-19 examples into other\nclasses. DCSL is so flexible that it can apply in any deep neural network.

We show that it is superior in accuracy and robustness compared\nto traditional approaches. Second, we decrease the dependency on the\ncalibration object to a single 3D-point by using a similar formulation based on\nthe equation of translation which is much less affected by the estimation error\nof the calibration object's orientation.

The\nmagnetic transition could be tuned continuously with Mn substitution at the Fe\nsite. The Mn substitution leads to a linear increase in the unit cell volume\nand a slight reduction in the effective moment. A detailed critical analysis of\nthe magnetization data for $x = 0.0$ and 0.2 is performed in the critical\nregime using the modified Arrott plots, Kouvel-Fisher plot, universal curve\nscaling, and scaling analysis of magnetocaloric effect.

Thus, the essence of\ndomain adaptation is to mitigate the distribution divergence between the two\ndomains. The state-of-the-art methods practice this very idea by either\nconducting adversarial training or minimizing a metric which defines the\ndistribution gaps. In this paper, we propose a new domain adaptation method\nnamed Adversarial Tight Match (ATM) which enjoys the benefits of both\nadversarial training and metric learning. Specifically, at first, we propose a\nnovel distance loss, named Maximum Density Divergence (MDD), to quantify the\ndistribution divergence. MDD minimizes the inter-domain divergence (\"match\" in\nATM) and maximizes the intra-class density (\"tight\" in ATM). Then, to address\nthe equilibrium challenge issue in adversarial domain adaptation, we consider\nleveraging the proposed MDD into adversarial domain adaptation framework. At\nlast, we tailor the proposed MDD as a practical learning loss and report our\nATM. Both empirical evaluation and theoretical analysis are reported to verify\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method.

The CGEM-IT will be composed of three coaxial layers of\ncylindrical triple GEMs, operating in an Ar$\\,$+$\\,$iC$_4$H$_{10}$ (90:10) gas\nmixture with field and gain optimized to maximize the spatial resolution. The\nnew detector is readout with innovative TIGER electronics produced in 110$\\,$nm\nCMOS technology. The front end is a custom designed 64$\\,$channel ASIC\nfeaturing a fully digital output and operated in trigger-less mode. It can\nprovide analog charge and time measurements with a TDC time resolution better\nthan 100$\\,$ps, that will allow to operate in $\\mu$TPC mode. Before the\ninstallation inside BESIII, foreseen in 2021, a long standalone data taking is\nongoing at the Institute of High Energy Physics in Beijing; currently, the\nfirst two cylindrical chambers are available for the test, and are used to\ncomplete the integration between the detector and the electronics and to assess\nthe required performance. In this proceeding a description of the CGEM-IT\nproject, the TIGER features and performance, and the results of the analysis of\nfirst cosmic ray data taking will be presented. Focus will be given on the\nstrip analysis, from which it is possible to measure the basic properties of\nthe detector, and the cluster analysis. The first preliminary results on\nefficiency and spatial resolution will be also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 07:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

The client's goal is to use\nas few resources as possible. This problem, with a representative protocol by\nBroadbent, Fitzsimons and Kashefi [FOCS09, arXiv:0807.4154], has become\nfundamental to the study of quantum cryptography, not only because of its own\nimportance, but also because it provides a testbed for new techniques that can\nbe later applied to related problems (for example, quantum computation\nverification). Known protocols on this problem are mainly either\ninformation-theoretically (IT) secure or based on trapdoor assumptions (public\nkey encryptions).\n  In this paper we study how the availability of symmetric-key primitives,\nmodeled by a random oracle, changes the complexity of universal blind quantum\ncomputation. We give a new universal blind quantum computation protocol.\nSimilar to previous works on IT-secure protocols (for example, BFK [FOCS09,\narXiv:0807.4154]), our protocol can be divided into two phases. In the first\nphase the client prepares some quantum gadgets with relatively simple quantum\ngates and sends them to the server, and in the second phase the client is\nentirely classical -- it does not even need quantum storage. Crucially, the\nprotocol's first phase is succinct, that is, its complexity is independent of\nthe circuit size. Given the security parameter $\\kappa$, its complexity is only\na fixed polynomial of $\\kappa$, and can be used to evaluate any circuit (or\nseveral circuits) of size up to a subexponential of $\\kappa$. In contrast,\nknown schemes either require the client to perform quantum computations that\nscale with the size of the circuit [FOCS09, arXiv:0807.4154], or require\ntrapdoor assumptions [Mahadev, FOCS18, arXiv:1708.02130].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 07:47:11 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 12:25:35 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 18:58:25 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 20:14:59 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 07:55:45 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 09:23:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 10:16:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 15:46:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 19:43:46 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 18:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 18:55:12 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 13:32:44 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 19:56:45 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 16:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

We study HD 137071, a star\nthat has been considered so far as a normal K-type red giant. Its parallax\nmeasured by Gaia and the derived luminosity suggest that it is actually a\nsupergiant, whereas its derived distance to the galactic plane and its spatial\nvelocity of 54.1 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the local standard of rest suggest\nthat it is also a runaway star. However, intrinsic limitations in determining\nthe trigonometric parallaxes of cool supergiants, even in the Gaia era, require\naccurate spectral classifications for confirmation.

Because the camera and LiDAR sensor signals\nhave different characteristics and distributions, fusing these two modalities\nis expected to improve both the accuracy and robustness of 3D object detection.\nOne of the challenges presented by the fusion of cameras and LiDAR is that the\nspatial feature maps obtained from each modality are represented by\nsignificantly different views in the camera and world coordinates; hence, it is\nnot an easy task to combine two heterogeneous feature maps without loss of\ninformation. To address this problem, we propose a method called 3D-CVF that\ncombines the camera and LiDAR features using the cross-view spatial feature\nfusion strategy. First, the method employs auto-calibrated projection, to\ntransform the 2D camera features to a smooth spatial feature map with the\nhighest correspondence to the LiDAR features in the bird's eye view (BEV)\ndomain. Then, a gated feature fusion network is applied to use the spatial\nattention maps to mix the camera and LiDAR features appropriately according to\nthe region. Next, camera-LiDAR feature fusion is also achieved in the\nsubsequent proposal refinement stage. The camera feature is used from the 2D\ncamera-view domain via 3D RoI grid pooling and fused with the BEV feature for\nproposal refinement. Our evaluations, conducted on the KITTI and nuScenes 3D\nobject detection datasets demonstrate that the camera-LiDAR fusion offers\nsignificant performance gain over single modality and that the proposed 3D-CVF\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in the KITTI benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 08:34:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 03:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

Direct evidence\nof the latter was previously found only in two core-collapse supernova events,\nand appears to be absent in thermonuclear supernovae.Aims: We aim to to\nconstrain the supernova progenitor types of Cas A, SN 1987A, Vela Jr.,\nG1.9+0.3, SN1572, and SN1604 through their $^{44}$Ti ejecta masses and\nexplosion kinematics. Methods: We analyzed INTEGRAL/SPI observations of the\ncandidate sources utilizing an empirically motivated high-precision background\nmodel. We analyzed the three dominant spectroscopically resolved de-excitation\nlines at 68, 78, and 1157\\,keV emitted in the decay chain of $^{44}$Ti. The\nfluxes allow the determination of the production yields of $^{44}$Ti. Remnant\nkinematics were obtained from the Doppler characteristics of the lines.\nResults: We find a significant signal for Cas A in all three lines with a\ncombined significance of 5.4$\\sigma$. The fluxes are $(3.3 \\pm 0.9) \\times\n10^{-5}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, and $(4.2 \\pm 1.0) \\times 10^{-5}$ ph cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$ for the $^{44}$Ti and $^{44}$Sc decay, respectively. We obtain higher\nfluxes for $^{44}$Ti with our analysis of Cas A than were obtained in previous\nanalyses. We discuss potential differences. Conclusions: We obtain a high\n$^{44}$Ti ejecta mass for Cas A that is in disagreement with ejecta yields from\nsymmetric 2D models. Upper limits for the other core-collapse supernovae are in\nagreement with model predictions and previous studies. The upper limits we find\nfor the three thermonuclear supernovae consistently exclude the double\ndetonation and pure helium deflagration models as progenitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 10:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Automatic metrics such as BLEU rely on references, but for tasks\nsuch as open-ended generation, there are no references to draw upon. Although\nlanguage diversity can be estimated using statistical measures such as\nperplexity, measuring language quality requires human evaluation. However,\nbecause human evaluation at scale is slow and expensive, it is used sparingly;\nit cannot be used to rapidly iterate on NLG models, in the way BLEU is used for\nmachine translation.

Methods: The information contained in the time-frequency domain\nof these signals and its compressed representations is exploited and their\ndiscriminant properties are studied. Their efficacy for the task of normal vs\nabnormal signal classification is evaluated using a comprehensive experimental\nframework. Based on this, the impact of the feature extraction parameters on\nthe classification performance is investigated using Classification and\nRegression Trees (CART), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector\nMachine (SVM) classifiers. Results: It is shown that classification is\nsuccessful with an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve\nof 0.92. Conclusion: The analysis indicates improvements in classification\nperformance when using non-uniform frequency scaling and identifies specific\nfrequency bands that contain discriminative features. Significance: Contrary to\nother studies that focus on sit-to-stand movements and knee flexion/extension,\nthis study used knee sounds obtained during walking.

The effects on a Hilbert space and the unit interval of a von\nNeumann or JBW algebra are examples of normal SEAs that are in addition convex,\ni.e. possess a suitable action of the real unit interval on the algebra.\nComplete Boolean algebras form normal SEAs too, which are convex only when\n$0=1$.\n  We show that any normal SEA $E$ splits as a direct sum $E\\equiv E_b\\oplus E_c\n\\oplus E_{ac}$ of a complete Boolean algebra $E_b$, a convex normal SEA $E_c$,\nand a newly identified type of normal SEA $E_{ac}$ we dub purely almost-convex.\nAlong the way we show, among other things, that a SEA which contains only\nidempotents must be a Boolean algebra; and we establish a spectral theorem\nusing which we settle for the class of normal SEAs a problem of Gudder\nregarding the uniqueness of square roots.

However, these algorithms and their variants still suffer\nfrom some difficulties such as determination of the optimal number of clusters\nwhich is a key factor for clustering quality. A common approach for overcoming\nthis difficulty is to use the trial-and-validation strategy, i.e., traversing\nevery integer from large number like $\\sqrt{n}$ to 2 until finding the optimal\nnumber corresponding to the peak value of some cluster validity index. But it\nis scarcely possible to naturally construct an adaptively agglomerative\nhierarchical cluster structure as using the trial-and-validation strategy. Even\npossible, existing different validity indices also lead to different number of\nclusters. To effectively mitigate the problems while motivated by convex\nclustering, in this paper we present a Centroid Auto-Fused Hierarchical Fuzzy\nc-means method (CAF-HFCM) whose optimization procedure can automatically\nagglomerate to form a cluster hierarchy, more importantly, yielding an optimal\nnumber of clusters without resorting to any validity index. Although a\nrecently-proposed robust-learning fuzzy c-means (RL-FCM) can also automatically\nobtain the best number of clusters without the help of any validity index,\nso-involved 3 hyper-parameters need to adjust expensively, conversely, our\nCAF-HFCM involves just 1 hyper-parameter which makes the corresponding\nadjustment is relatively easier and more operational.

Moreover, our\nproposed CAF-HFCM method is able to be straightforwardly extended to various\nvariants of FCM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 12:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

It is further demonstrated that such\ninteractions drive a phonon flow between the dot and bath whose direction and\nmagnitude depend on the temperature difference between the dot and bath. To\njustify its impact in optimizing the peak CP and COP, we show that a weak\ncoupling with the bath is preferable when the phonons relax through it and a\nstrong coupling is suitable in the opposite case when the phonons are extracted\nfrom the bath. Finally, in studying the effect of asymmetry in electronic\ncouplings, we show that a stronger coupling is favorable with the contact whose\ntemperature is closer to that of the bath. Combining these aspects, we believe\nthat this study could offer important guidelines for a possible realization of\nmolecular and quantum dot thermoelectric refrigerator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 13:06:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 18:11:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Current blockchain\nsystems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum require users to constantly observe the\nstate changes of interest or the events taking place in a blockchain and\nrequires the user to explicitly release the required transactions to respond to\nthe observed events in the blockchain. This paper proposes EventWarden, a\ndecentralized event-driven proxy service for users to outsource transactions in\nEthereum-like blockchains. EventWarden employs a novel combination of smart\ncontracts and blockchain logs. EventWarden allows a user to create a proxy\nsmart contract that specifies an interested event and also reserves an\narbitrary transaction to release. Upon observing the occurrence of the\nprescribed event, anyone in the Blockchain network can call the proxy contract\nto earn the service fee reserved in the contract by proving to the contract\nthat the event has been recorded into blockchain logs, which then automatically\ntriggers the proxy contract to release the reserved transaction. We show that\nthe reserved transaction can only get released from the proxy contract when the\nprescribed event has taken place. We also demonstrate that as long as a single\nmember in the Blockchain network is incentivized by the service fee to call the\nproxy contract after the prescribed event has taken place, the reserved\ntransaction is guaranteed to get released. We implement EventWarden over the\nEthereum official test network. The results demonstrate that EventWarden is\neffective and is ready-to-use in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 13:39:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 05:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-08"}

These enhancements\ndepend on the exchange rates between the amides and the water, thereby yielding\ndiagnostic information about solvent accessibility. This study applied this\nHyperW method to four proteins exhibiting a gamut of exchange behaviors: PhoA4,\nan unfolded 122-residue fragment; barstar, a fully folded ribonuclease\ninhibitor; R17, a 13.3 kDa system possessing folded and unfolded forms under\nslow interconversion; and drkN SH3, a protein domain whose folded and unfolded\nforms interchange rapidly and with temperature-dependent population ratios.

Though fully folded barstar also exhibited\nsubstantial enhancements; these, however, were not uniform, and according to\nCLEANEX experiments reflected the solvent-exposed residues. R17 showed the\nexpected superposition of 100-fold enhancements for its unfolded form,\ncoexisting with more modest folded counterparts.

As existing approaches either focus on\nstation-level or user-level signals, they are prone to overfitting and generate\nless credible and insightful results. To properly learn such characteristics\nfrom trip data, we propose a Collective Learning Framework through Latent\nRepresentation, which augments user-level learning with collective patterns\nlearned from station-level signals. This framework uses a novel, so-called\nTidal-Regularized Non-negative Matrix Factorization method, which incorporates\ndomain knowledge in the form of temporal passenger flow patterns in generic\nNon-negative Matrix Factorization. To evaluate our model performance, a user\nstability test based on the classical Rand Index is introduced as a metric to\nbenchmark different unsupervised learning models.

These fields constitute a finite number of\ngroup invariant operators which are assembled to build a polynomial, known as\nthe Lagrangian. The order of the polynomial is determined by the mass\ndimension. In this paper, we have introduced a Mathematica package, GrIP, that\ncomputes the complete set of operators that form a basis at each such order for\na model containing any number of fields transforming under connected compact\ngroups. The spacetime symmetry is restricted to the Lorentz group. The first\npart of the paper is dedicated to formulating the algorithm of GrIP.

While remarkably effective, the\nranking models based on these LMs increase computational cost by orders of\nmagnitude over prior approaches, particularly as they must feed each\nquery-document pair through a massive neural network to compute a single\nrelevance score. To tackle this, we present ColBERT, a novel ranking model that\nadapts deep LMs (in particular, BERT) for efficient retrieval. ColBERT\nintroduces a late interaction architecture that independently encodes the query\nand the document using BERT and then employs a cheap yet powerful interaction\nstep that models their fine-grained similarity. By delaying and yet retaining\nthis fine-granular interaction, ColBERT can leverage the expressiveness of deep\nLMs while simultaneously gaining the ability to pre-compute document\nrepresentations offline, considerably speeding up query processing. Beyond\nreducing the cost of re-ranking the documents retrieved by a traditional model,\nColBERT's pruning-friendly interaction mechanism enables leveraging\nvector-similarity indexes for end-to-end retrieval directly from a large\ndocument collection. We extensively evaluate ColBERT using two recent passage\nsearch datasets.

Much insight about cover times is gained by\nmapping to the (spaceless) coupon-collector problem, which amounts to ignoring\nspatio-temporal correlations, and an early conjecture that the limiting cover\ntime distribution of regular random walks on large lattices converges to the\nGumbel distribution in $d \\geq 3$ was recently proved rigorously. Furthermore,\na number of mathematical and numerical studies point to the robustness of the\nGumbel universality to modifications of the \\textit{spatial} features of the\nrandom search processes (e.g.\\ introducing persistence and/or intermittence, or\nchanging the graph topology). Here we investigate the robustness of the Gumbel\nuniversality to dynamical modification of the \\textit{temporal} features of the\nsearch, specifically by allowing the random walker to \"accelerate\" or\n\"decelerate\" upon visiting a previously unexplored site. We generalise the\nmapping mentioned above by relating the statistics of cover times to the\nroughness of $1/f^\\alpha$ Gaussian signals, leading to the conjecture that the\nGumbel distribution is but one of a family of cover time distributions, ranging\nfrom Gaussian for highly accelerated cover, to exponential for highly\ndecelerated cover.

The main challenge is how\nto measure such hardness and decide the required depths (i.e., layers) to\nconduct. Previous works generally build a halting unit to decide whether the\ncomputation should continue or stop at each layer. As there is no specific\nsupervision of depth selection, the halting unit may be under-optimized and\ninaccurate, which results in suboptimal and unstable performance when modeling\nsentences. In this paper, we get rid of the halting unit and estimate the\nrequired depths in advance, which yields a faster depth-adaptive model.\nSpecifically, two approaches are proposed to explicitly measure the hardness of\ninput words and estimate corresponding adaptive depth, namely 1) mutual\ninformation (MI) based estimation and 2) reconstruction loss based estimation.\nWe conduct experiments on the text classification task with 24 datasets in\nvarious sizes and domains.

Within the vast scope of ITS, score prediction\nstands out as an area of study that enables students to construct individually\nrealistic goals based on their current position. Via the expected score\nprovided by the ITS, a student can instantaneously compare one's expected score\nto one's actual score, which directly corresponds to the reliability that the\nITS can instill. In other words, refining the precision of predicted scores\nstrictly correlates to the level of confidence that a student may have with an\nITS, which will evidently ensue improved student engagement. However, previous\nstudies have solely concentrated on improving the performance of a prediction\nmodel, largely lacking focus on the benefits generated by its practical\napplication. In this paper, we demonstrate that the accuracy of the score\nprediction model deployed in a real-world setting significantly impacts user\nengagement by providing empirical evidence.

This paper\nintroduces a new cognitive training (CT) paradigm designed to address these two\nlimitations by combining the benefits of gamification, virtual reality (VR),\nand affective adaptation in the development of an engaging, ecologically valid,\nCT task. Additionally, it incorporates facial electromyography (EMG) as a means\nof determining user affect while engaged in the CT task.
