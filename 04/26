Using Transfer Learning with pre-trained\nmodels and TensorFlow, we present a performance comparison between the main\nalgorithms reported in the literature for object detection,such as SSD, Faster\nR-CNN and R-FCN along with MobilenetV2, InceptionV2, ResNet50, ResNet101\nfeature extractors. Moreover, we propose multi-class detection with eight\ndifferent classes according to orientations. To do so, we introduce a new\ndataset called \"Detect-Bike\", containing 20,229 cyclist instances over 11,103\nimages, which has been labeled based on cyclist's orientation. Then, the same\nDeep Learning methods used for detection are trained to determine the target's\nheading. Our experimental results and vast evaluation showed satisfactory\nperformance of all of the studied methods for the cyclists and their\norientation detection, especially using Faster R-CNN with ResNet50 proved to be\nprecise but significantly slower. Meanwhile, SSD using InceptionV2 provided\ngood trade-off between precision and execution time, and is to be preferred for\nreal-time embedded applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2020 18:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-29"}

We propose a structure that can\naccurately represent the recipe as well as a pipeline to infer the best\nrepresentation of the recipe in this uniform structure. The Ingredients section\nin a recipe typically lists down the ingredients required and corresponding\nattributes such as quantity, temperature, and processing state. This can be\nmodelled by defining these attributes and their values. The physical entities\nwhich make up a recipe can be broadly classified into utensils, ingredients and\ntheir combinations that are related by cooking techniques. The instruction\nsection lists down a series of events in which a cooking technique or process\nis applied upon these utensils and ingredients. We model these relationships in\nthe form of tuples. Thus, using a combination of these methods we model cooking\nrecipe in the dataset RecipeDB to show the efficacy of our method. This mined\ninformation model can have several applications which include translating\nrecipes between languages, determining similarity between recipes, generation\nof novel recipes and estimation of the nutritional profile of recipes.

We compute the quasi-normal\nmodes (QNMs) of the decoupled perturbations using the Schutz-Iyer-Will's WKB\nmethod. We discuss the stability of the charged black holes by investigating\nthe dependence of quasi-normal frequencies on the parameters of the theory,\ncorrecting some errors in the literature. It is found that all the axial\nperturbations are stable for the cases where the WKB method applies.

At each iteration, our decoder focuses on the\nrelevant parts of the image using an attention mechanism, and then estimates\nthe object's class and the bounding box coordinates.

While the steep decay\nis usually interpreted as the tail of the prompt gamma-ray flash, the\nlong-lasting plateau is commonly associated to the emission from the external\nshock sustained by energy injection from a long lasting central engine. A\nrecent study proposed an alternative interpretation, ascribing both the steep\ndecay and the plateau to high-latitude emission (HLE) from a \"structured jet\"\nwhose energy and bulk Lorentz factor depend on the angular distance from the\njet symmetry axis.

Yet, how precisely cells as individual\nmechanical entities can act to morph a tissue reliably and efficiently into\nthree dimensions during outgrowth is still puzzling especially when cells are\ntightly connected as in plant tissue. In plants, the mechanics of cells within\na tissue is particularly well defined as individual cell growth is essentially\nthe mechanical yielding of cell-wall in response to internal turgor pressure.\nCell wall stiffness is controlled by biological signalling and, hence, cell\ngrowth is observed to respond to mechanical stresses building up within a\ntissue. What is the role of the mechanical feedback during morphing of tissue\nin three dimensions? Here, we develop a three dimensional vertex model to\ninvestigate tissue mechanics at the onset of organ outgrowth at the tip of a\nplant shoot. We find that organ height is primarily governed by the ratio of\ngrowth rates of faster growing cells initiating the organ to slower growing\ncells surrounding them. Remarkably, the outgrowth rate is higher when cells\ngrowth responds to the tissue-wide mechanical stresses. Our quantitative\nanalysis of simulation data shows that tissue mechanical feedback on cell\ngrowth can act via twofold mechanism. First, the feedback guides patterns of\ncellular growth. Second, the feedback modifies the stress patterns on the\ncells, consequently amplifying and propagating growth anisotropies. This\nmechanism may allow plants to grow organs efficiently out of the meristem by\nreorganizing the cellular growth rather than inflating growth rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2020 19:47:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

One of the technical challenges that arise\nin the signal processing stage is removing the twin image that is caused by the\nphase-conjugate wavefront from the recorded holograms. Twin image removal is\ntypically formulated as a non-linear inverse problem due to the irreversible\nscattering process when generating the hologram. Recently, end-to-end deep\nlearning-based methods have been utilized to reconstruct the object wavefront\n(as a surrogate for the 3D structure of the object) directly from a single-shot\nin-line digital hologram. However, massive data pairs are required to train\ndeep learning models for acceptable reconstruction precision. In contrast to\ntypical image processing problems, well-curated datasets for in-line digital\nholography does not exist. Also, the trained model highly influenced by the\nmorphological properties of the object and hence can vary for different\napplications. Therefore, data collection can be prohibitively cumbersome in\npractice as a major hindrance to using deep learning for digital holography. In\nthis paper, we proposed a novel implementation of autoencoder-based deep\nlearning architecture for single-shot hologram reconstruction solely based on\nthe current sample without the need for massive datasets to train the model.\nThe simulations results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed\nmethod compared to the state of the art single-shot compressive digital in-line\nhologram reconstruction method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2020 20:39:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 22:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

Unfortunately, it spoils the slowly-varying-in-space limits of the\nuncorrected approximate functionals, where those functionals are right by\nconstruction. The right limits can be restored by locally scaling down the\nenergy density of the PZ SIC in many-electron regions, but then a spurious\ncorrection to the exact functional would be found unless the self-Hartree and\nexact self-xc terms of the PZ SIC energy density were expressed in the same\ngauge. Only the local density approximation satisfies the same-gauge condition\nfor the energy density, which explains why the recent local-scaling SIC (LSIC)\nis found here to work excellently for atoms and molecules only with this basic\napproximation, and not with the more advanced generalized gradient\napproximations (GGAs) and meta-GGAs, which lose the Hartree gauge via\nsimplifying integrations by parts. The transformation of energy density that\nachieves the Hartree gauge for the exact xc functional can also be applied to\napproximate functionals. Doing so leads to a simple scaled-down\nself-interaction (sdSIC) correction that is typically much more accurate than\nPZ SIC in tests for many molecular properties (including equilibrium bond\nlengths). The present work shows unambiguously that the largest errors of PZ\nSIC applied to standard functionals at three levels of approximation can be\nremoved by restoring their correct slowly-varying-density limits. It also\nconfirms the relevance of these limits to atoms and molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2020 21:09:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Built on\nthe top of FAPG, we further propose universal audio adversarial perturbation\ngenerator (UAPG), a scheme crafting universal adversarial perturbation that can\nbe imposed on arbitrary benign audio input to cause misclassification.\nExtensive experiments show that our proposed FAPG can achieve up to 167X\nspeedup over the state-of-the-art audio adversarial attack methods. Also our\nproposed UAPG can generate universal adversarial perturbation that achieves\nmuch better attack performance than the state-of-the-art solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 00:51:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2021 17:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

There is a need of\nsecure and robust encryption algorithm that can be implemented on each and\ndiverse software and hardware platforms. Also, in block symmetric encryption\nalgorithms, substitution boxes are the most vital part. In this paper, we\ninvestigate semifield substitution boxes using permutation of symmetric group\non a set of size 8 S_8 and establish an effective procedure for generating S_8\nsemifield substitution boxes having same algebraic properties. Further, the\nstrength analysis of the generated substitution boxes is carried out using the\nwell-known standards namely bijectivity, nonlinearity, strict avalanche\ncriterion, bit independence criterion, XOR table and differential invariant.\nBased on the analysis results, it is shown that the cryptographic strength of\ngenerated substitution boxes is on par with the best known $8\\times 8$\nsubstitution boxes. As application, an encryption algorithm is proposed that\ncan be employed to strengthen any kind of secure communication. The presented\nalgorithm is mainly based on the Shannon idea of (S-P) network where the\nprocess of substitution is performed by the proposed S_8 semifield substitution\nboxes and permutation operation is performed by the binary cyclic shift of\nsubstitution box transformed data. In addition, the proposed encryption\nalgorithm utilizes two different chaotic maps.

Explainability is not only a gateway between AI and real\nworld, but also a powerful feature to detect flaw of the models and bias of the\ndata. Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) is a\nwidely-accepted technique that explains the prediction of any classifier\nfaithfully by learning an interpretable model locally around the predicted\ninstance. As an extension of LIME, this paper proposes an high-interpretability\nand high-fidelity local explanation method, known as Local Explanation using\nfeature Dependency Sampling and Nonlinear Approximation (LEDSNA). Given an\ninstance being explained, LEDSNA enhances interpretability by feature sampling\nwith intrinsic dependency. Besides, LEDSNA improves the local explanation\nfidelity by approximating nonlinear boundary of local decision. We evaluate our\nmethod with classification tasks in both image domain and text domain.\nExperiments show that LEDSNA's explanation of the back-box model achieves much\nbetter performance than original LIME in terms of interpretability and\nfidelity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 02:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

Existing work in this area has\nbeen largely focused on matching between short texts (e.g., question\nanswering), or between a short and a long text (e.g., ad-hoc retrieval).\nSemantic matching between long-form documents, which has many important\napplications like news recommendation, related article recommendation and\ndocument clustering, is relatively less explored and needs more research\neffort. In recent years, self-attention based models like Transformers and BERT\nhave achieved state-of-the-art performance in the task of text matching. These\nmodels, however, are still limited to short text like a few sentences or one\nparagraph due to the quadratic computational complexity of self-attention with\nrespect to input text length. In this paper, we address the issue by proposing\nthe Siamese Multi-depth Transformer-based Hierarchical (SMITH) Encoder for\nlong-form document matching. Our model contains several innovations to adapt\nself-attention models for longer text input. In order to better capture\nsentence level semantic relations within a document, we pre-train the model\nwith a novel masked sentence block language modeling task in addition to the\nmasked word language modeling task used by BERT.

In order to cope with these constraints,\nthis manuscript proposes an uncertainty-based framework for mapping and\nplanning feasible motions online with probabilistic safety-guarantees. The\nproposed approach deals with the motion, probabilistic safety, and online\ncomputation constraints by: (i) incrementally mapping the surroundings to build\nan uncertainty-aware representation of the environment, and (ii) iteratively\n(re)planning trajectories to goal that are kinodynamically feasible and\nprobabilistically safe through a multi-layered sampling-based planner in the\nbelief space.

Several African countries, especially South Africa, have\nalready taken strong non-pharmaceutical interventions that include physical\ndistancing, restricted economic, educational and leisure activities and reduced\nhuman mobility options. The required strengths and overall effectiveness of\nsuch interventions, however, are debated because of simultaneous but opposing\ninterests in most African countries: strongly limited health care capacities\nand testing capabilities largely conflict with pressured national economies and\nsocio-economic hardships on the individual level, limiting compliance to\nintervention targets. Here we investigate implications of interventions on the\nCOVID-19 outbreak dynamics, focusing on South Africa before and after the\nnational lockdown enacted on March 27, 2020. Our analysis shows that initial\nexponential growth of existing case numbers is consistent with doubling times\nof about $2.5$ days. After lockdown, the growth remains exponential, now with\ndoubling times of 18 days, but still in contrast to subexponential growth\nreported for Hubei/China after lockdown. Moreover, a scenario analysis of a\ncomputational data-driven agent based mobility model for the Nelson Mandela Bay\nMunicipality (with $1.14$ million inhabitants) hints that keeping current\nlevels of intervention measures and compliance until the end of April is of\ninsufficient length and still too weak, too unspecific or too inconsistently\ncomplied with to not overload local intensive care capacity. Yet, enduring,\nslightly stronger, more specific interventions combined with sufficient\ncompliance may constitute a viable option for interventions for regions in\nSouth Africa and potentially for large parts of the African continent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 08:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

However, these models either\ntypically assume improper prior (e.g. Gaussian or Logistic Normal) over latent\ntopic space or could not infer topic distribution for a given document. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a neural topic modeling approach, called\nBidirectional Adversarial Topic (BAT) model, which represents the first attempt\nof applying bidirectional adversarial training for neural topic modeling. The\nproposed BAT builds a two-way projection between the document-topic\ndistribution and the document-word distribution. It uses a generator to capture\nthe semantic patterns from texts and an encoder for topic inference.\nFurthermore, to incorporate word relatedness information, the Bidirectional\nAdversarial Topic model with Gaussian (Gaussian-BAT) is extended from BAT. To\nverify the effectiveness of BAT and Gaussian-BAT, three benchmark corpora are\nused in our experiments. The experimental results show that BAT and\nGaussian-BAT obtain more coherent topics, outperforming several competitive\nbaselines.

However, manually annotating a large\ndataset with a protected attribute is slow and expensive. Instead of annotating\nall the examples, can we annotate a subset of them and use that sample to\nestimate the bias? While it is possible to do so, the smaller this annotated\nsample is, the less certain we are that the estimate is close to the true bias.\nIn this work, we propose using Bernstein bounds to represent this uncertainty\nabout the bias estimate as a confidence interval. We provide empirical evidence\nthat a 95% confidence interval derived this way consistently bounds the true\nbias. In quantifying this uncertainty, our method, which we call\nBernstein-bounded unfairness, helps prevent classifiers from being deemed\nbiased or unbiased when there is insufficient evidence to make either claim.\nOur findings suggest that the datasets currently used to measure specific\nbiases are too small to conclusively identify bias except in the most egregious\ncases.

The process of\ndistinguishing tumor boundaries from healthy cells is still a challenging task\nin the clinical routine. Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MRI\nmodality can provide the physician with information about tumor infiltration.\nTherefore, this paper proposes a new generic deep learning architecture; namely\nDeepSeg for fully automated detection and segmentation of the brain lesion\nusing FLAIR MRI data.\n  Methods: The developed DeepSeg is a modular decoupling framework. It consists\nof two connected core parts based on an encoding and decoding relationship. The\nencoder part is a convolutional neural network (CNN) responsible for spatial\ninformation extraction. The resulting semantic map is inserted into the decoder\npart to get the full resolution probability map. Based on modified U-Net\narchitecture, different CNN models such as Residual Neural Network (ResNet),\nDense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), and NASNet have been utilized in this\nstudy.\n  Results: The proposed deep learning architectures have been successfully\ntested and evaluated on-line based on MRI datasets of Brain Tumor Segmentation\n(BraTS 2019) challenge, including s336 cases as training data and 125 cases for\nvalidation data. The dice and Hausdorff distance scores of obtained\nsegmentation results are about 0.81 to 0.84 and 9.8 to 19.7 correspondingly.\n  Conclusion: This study showed successful feasibility and comparative\nperformance of applying different deep learning models in a new DeepSeg\nframework for automated brain tumor segmentation in FLAIR MR images.

A uniform bounded variation\nestimate for finite volume solutions of the conservation law $\\partial_t \\alpha\n+ \\mathrm{div}(\\boldsymbol{F}(t,\\boldsymbol{x},\\alpha)) = 0$, where\n$\\mathrm{div}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\boldsymbol{F} \\not=0$ on nonuniform Cartesian\ngrids is also proved. Such an estimate provides compactness for finite volume\napproximations in $L^p$ spaces, which is essential to prove the existence of a\nsolution for a partial differential equation with nonlinear terms in $\\alpha$,\nwhen the uniqueness of the solution is not available. This application is\ndemonstrated by establishing the existence of a weak solution for a model that\ndescribes the evolution of initial stages of breast cancer proposed by S. J.\nFranks et al. [14]. The model consists of four coupled variables: tumour cell\nconcentration, tumour cell velocity--pressure, and nutrient concentration,\nwhich are governed by a hyperbolic conservation law, viscous Stokes system, and\nPoisson equation, respectively.

In particular, the use of RGB-D sensors in handling these\ntasks has emerged as an important area of focus for better visual\nunderstanding. Meanwhile, deep neural networks, specifically convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs), have become widespread and have been applied to many\nvisual tasks by replacing hand-crafted features with effective deep features.\nHowever, it is an open problem how to exploit deep features from a multi-layer\nCNN model effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework\nthat extracts discriminative feature representations from multi-modal RGB-D\nimages for object and scene recognition tasks. In the first stage, a pretrained\nCNN model has been employed as a backbone to extract visual features at\nmultiple levels. The second stage maps these features into high level\nrepresentations with a fully randomized structure of recursive neural networks\n(RNNs) efficiently. To cope with the high dimensionality of CNN activations, a\nrandom weighted pooling scheme has been proposed by extending the idea of\nrandomness in RNNs. Multi-modal fusion has been performed through a soft voting\napproach by computing weights based on individual recognition confidences (i.e.\nSVM scores) of RGB and depth streams separately. This produces consistent class\nlabel estimation in final RGB-D classification performance. Extensive\nexperiments verify that fully randomized structure in RNN stage encodes CNN\nactivations to discriminative solid features successfully. Comparative\nexperimental results on the popular Washington RGB-D Object and SUN RGB-D Scene\ndatasets show that the proposed approach achieves superior or on-par\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods both in object and scene\nrecognition tasks.

The web interface\nallows user-friendly visual exploration of the virus-host interactome and\nimplements systems medicine algorithms for network-based prediction of drugs.\nThus, CoVex is an important resource, not only to understand the molecular\nmechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 pathogenicity, but also in\nclinical research for the identification and prioritization of candidate\ntherapeutics. We apply CoVex to investigate recent hypotheses on a systems\nbiology level and to systematically explore the molecular mechanisms driving\nthe virus life cycle. Furthermore, we extract and discuss drug repurposing\ncandidates involved in these mechanisms. CoVex renders COVID-19 drug research\nsystems-medicine-ready by giving the scientific community direct access to\nnetwork medicine algorithms integrating virus-host-drug interactions.

The main reason\nfor some epidemic turning into pandemics is the connectivity among different\nregions of the world, which makes it easier to affect a wider geographical\narea, often worldwide. In addition, the population distribution and social\ncoherence in the different regions of the world is non-uniform. Thus, once the\nepidemic enters a region, then the local population distribution plays an\nimportant role. Inspired by these ideas, we proposed a mobility-based SIR model\nfor epidemics, which especially takes into account pandemic situations.

Using Bayesian model reduction, we\nidentify the effective connectivity between States that best explains the\ninitial phases of the outbreak in the United States.

A variable friction coefficient\nbased on the $\\mu(I)$ rheology is considered. The model is obtained from an\nasymptotic analysis in a local reference system, where the non-hydrostatic\ncontribution is supposed to be small compared to the hydrostatic one. The\nnon-hydrostatic counterpart of the pressure may be written as the sum of two\nterms: one corresponding to the stress tensor and the other to the vertical\nacceleration. The model introduced here is weakly non-hydrostatic, in the sense\nthat the non-hydrostatic contribution related to the stress tensor is not taken\ninto account due to its complex implementation. A simple and efficient\nnumerical scheme is proposed. It consists of a three-step splitting procedure,\nand it is based on a hydrostatic reconstruction. Two key points are: (i) the\nfriction force has to be taken into account before solving the non-hydrostatic\npressure. Otherwise, the incompressibility condition is not ensured; (ii) both\nthe hydrostatic and the non-hydrostatic pressure are taken into account when\ndealing with the friction force. The model and numerical scheme are then\nvalidated based on several numerical tests, including laboratory experiments of\ngranular collapse. The influence of non-hydrostatic terms and of the choice of\nthe coordinate system (Cartesian or local) is analyzed. We show that\nnon-hydrostatic models are less sensitive to the choice of the coordinate\nsystem. In general, the non-hydrostatic model introduced here much better\nreproduces granular collapse experiments compared to hydrostatic models. An\nimportant result is that the simulated mass profiles up to the deposit and the\nfront velocity are greatly improved. As expected, the influence of the\nnon-hydrostatic pressure is shown to be larger for small values of the slope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 09:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

However, most existing KG embedding models\nneglect space and, therefore, do not perform well when applied to (geo)spatial\ndata and tasks. For those models that consider space, most of them primarily\nrely on some notions of distance. These models suffer from higher computational\ncomplexity during training while still losing information beyond the relative\ndistance between entities. In this work, we propose a location-aware KG\nembedding model called SE-KGE. It directly encodes spatial information such as\npoint coordinates or bounding boxes of geographic entities into the KG\nembedding space. The resulting model is capable of handling different types of\nspatial reasoning. We also construct a geographic knowledge graph as well as a\nset of geographic query-answer pairs called DBGeo to evaluate the performance\nof SE-KGE in comparison to multiple baselines. Evaluation results show that\nSE-KGE outperforms these baselines on the DBGeo dataset for geographic logic\nquery answering task. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our\nspatially-explicit model and the importance of considering the scale of\ndifferent geographic entities.

The original version\nof PD was restricted to bond-based interactions. Bond-based PD is geometrically\nexact and its kinematics are similar to classical continuum mechanics (CCM).\nHowever, it cannot capture the Poisson effect correctly. This shortcoming was\naddressed via state-based PD, but the kinematics are not accurately preserved.\nContinuum-kinematics-inspired peridynamics (CPD) provides a geometrically exact\nframework whose underlying kinematics coincide with that of CCM and captures\nthe Poisson effect correctly. In CPD, one distinguishes between one-, two- and\nthree-neighbour interactions. One-neighbour interactions are equivalent to the\nbond-based interactions of the original PD formalism. However, two- and\nthree-neighbour interactions are fundamentally different from state-based\ninteractions as the basic elements of continuum kinematics are preserved\nprecisely. The objective of this contribution is to elaborate on computational\naspects of CPD and present detailed derivations that are essential for its\nimplementation. Key features of the resulting computational CPD are elucidated\nvia a series of numerical examples. These include three-dimensional problems at\nlarge deformations.

Cancer immunotherapies use elements of the patient immune\nsystem to attack tumor cells. One of the most successful types of immunotherapy\nis CAR-T cells. This treatment works by extracting patient's T-cells and adding\nto them an antigen receptor allowing tumor cells to be recognized and targeted.\nThese new cells are called CAR-T cells and are re-infused back into the patient\nafter expansion in-vitro. This approach has been successfully used to treat\nB-cell malignancies (B-cell leukemias and lymphomas). However, its application\nto the treatment of T-cell leukemias faces several problems. One of these is\nfratricide, since the CAR-T cells target both tumor and other CAR-T cells. This\nleads to nonlinear dynamical phenomena amenable to mathematical modeling. In\nthis paper we construct a mathematical model describing the competition of\nCAR-T, tumor and normal T-cells and studied some basic properties of the model\nand its practical implications.

The mathematical model predicted that CAR-T cell\nexpansion in the patient would be possible due to the initial presence of a\nlarge number of targets.
