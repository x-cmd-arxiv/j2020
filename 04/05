The learning objective of GANs usually minimizes some\nmeasure discrepancy, \\textit{e.g.}, $f$-divergence~($f$-GANs) or Integral\nProbability Metric~(Wasserstein GANs). With $f$-divergence as the objective\nfunction, the discriminator essentially estimates the density ratio, and the\nestimated ratio proves useful in further improving the sample quality of the\ngenerator. However, how to leverage the information contained in the\ndiscriminator of Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) is less explored. In this paper, we\nintroduce the Discriminator Contrastive Divergence, which is well motivated by\nthe property of WGAN's discriminator and the relationship between WGAN and\nenergy-based model. Compared to standard GANs, where the generator is directly\nutilized to obtain new samples, our method proposes a semi-amortized generation\nprocedure where the samples are produced with the generator's output as an\ninitial state. Then several steps of Langevin dynamics are conducted using the\ngradient of the discriminator. We demonstrate the benefits of significant\nimproved generation on both synthetic data and several real-world image\ngeneration benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 01:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

In this\nstudy, we propose a new mathematical model of an ant--aphid system considering\nthe costs of ant attendance. It includes both mutualism and predation. In the\nmodel, we incorporate not only the trade-off between the intrinsic growth rate\nof aphids and the honeydew reward for ants, but also the facultative predation\nof aphids by ants. The analysis and computer simulations of the two-dimensional\nnonlinear dynamical system with functional response produces fixed points and\nalso novel and complex bifurcations. These results suggest that a higher degree\nof dependence of the aphids on the ants does not always enhance the abundance\nof the aphids. In contrast, the model without facultative predation gives a\nsimple prediction, that is, the higher the degree of dependence, the more\nabundant the aphids are. The present study predicts two overall scenarios for\nan ant--aphid system with mutualism and facultative predation: (1) aphids with\na lower intrinsic growth rate and many attending ants and (2) aphids with a\nhigher intrinsic growth rate and fewer attending ants. This seems to explain\nwhy there are two lineages of aphids: one is associated with ants and the other\nis not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2020 16:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

In this paper, we propose a novel emotion-relevant\ncritical subnetwork selection algorithm and investigate three EEG functional\nconnectivity network features: strength, clustering coefficient, and\neigenvector centrality. The discrimination ability of the EEG connectivity\nfeatures in emotion recognition is evaluated on three public emotion EEG\ndatasets: SEED, SEED-V, and DEAP.

A key step in SMC is resampling, which plays the role of steering the\nalgorithm towards the future dynamics. Several strategies have been proposed\nand used in practice, including multinomial resampling, residual resampling\n(Liu and Chen 1998), optimal resampling (Fearnhead and Clifford 2003),\nstratified resampling (Kitagawa 1996), and optimal transport resampling (Reich\n2013).

Perhaps counter-intuitively, $n$-qubit PRS are\nnot known to imply $k$-qubit PRS even for $k<n$. Therefore the question of\n\\emph{scalability} for PRS was thus far open: is it possible to construct\n$n$-qubit PRS generators with security parameter $\\lambda$ for all $n,\n\\lambda$.

The likelihood of the two types of\ndialogues is then formulated by a response generator and an image reconstructor\nthat are learned within a conditional variational auto-encoding framework.\nEmpirical studies are conducted in both image-grounded conversation and\ntext-based conversation. In the first scenario, image-grounded dialogues,\nespecially under a low-resource setting, can be effectively augmented by\ntextual dialogues with latent images; while in the second scenario, latent\nimages can enrich the content of responses and at the same time keep them\nrelevant to contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2020 17:32:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 07:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

This is reminiscent of so-called Jump-Markov systems in control\ntheory and allows the network topology to change over time. We argue that the\ncommon back-pressure control policy is inadequate to control such network\ndynamics and propose a novel control policy inspired by the paradigms of\nmodel-predictive control. Specifically, by defining a suitable but arbitrary\nprediction horizon, our policy takes into account the future network states and\npossible control actions. This stands in clear contrast to most other policies\nwhich are myopic, i.e. only consider the next state. We show numerically that\nsuch an approach can significantly improve the control performance and\nintroduce several variants, thereby trading off performance versus\ncomputational complexity. In addition, we prove so-called throughput optimality\nof our policy which guarantees stability for all network flows that can be\nmaintained by the network. Interestingly, in contrast to general stability\nproofs in model-predictive control, our proof does not require the assumption\nof a terminal set (i.e. for the prediction horizon to be large enough).\nFinally, we provide several illustrating examples, one of which being a network\nof synchronized queues. This one in particular constitutes an interesting\nsystem class, in which our policy exerts superiority over general back-pressure\npolicies, that even lose their throughput optimality in those networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2020 17:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

Motivated by these issues, we propose a general class of random\npartition models that satisfy the microclustering property with\nwell-characterized theoretical properties. Our proposed models overcome major\nlimitations in the existing literature on microclustering models, namely a lack\nof interpretability, identifiability, and full characterization of model\nasymptotic properties.

In addition, our framework provides flexibility in terms\nof the prior distribution of cluster sizes, computational tractability, and\napplicability to a large number of microclustering tasks. We establish\ntheoretical properties of the resulting class of priors, where we characterize\nthe asymptotic behavior of the number of clusters and of the proportion of\nclusters of a given size.

However, the complex mechanism that\ntriggers the shock revival and the subsequent explosion has remained\ninscrutable for many decades. Multidimensional simulations suggest that the\ngrowth of fluid instabilities and the development of turbulent convection will\ndetermine the morphology of the explosion. We have performed 3D simulations\nusing spherical-polar coordinates covering a reduced angular extent (90 degree\ncomputational domain), and with angular resolutions of 2 degrees, 1 degree, 1/2\ndegree, and 1/4 degree, to study the development of turbulence in core-collapse\nsupernova explosions on a time scale of order 100 ms. We have employed the\nmulti-physics Chimera code that includes detailed nuclear physics and spectral\nneutrino transport. Coarse resolution models do not develop an inertial range,\npresumably due to the bottleneck effect, such that the energy is prevented from\ncascading down to small scales and tends to accumulate at large scales.\nHigh-resolution models instead, start to recover the k^{-5/3} scaling of\nKolmogorov's theory. Stochasticity and few simulation samples limit our ability\nto predict the development of explosions. Over the simulated time period, our\nmodels show no clear trend in improving (or diminishing) conditions for\nexplosion as the angular resolution is increased. However, we find that\nturbulence provides an effective pressure behind the shock (approx. 40 - 50 %\nof the thermal pressure), which can contribute to the shock revival and be\nconducive for the development of the explosion. Finally, we show that the\nturbulent energy power spectrum of reduced angular extent and full 4 pi models\nare consistent, thus indicating that a 90 degree computational domain is an\nadequate configuration to study the character of turbulence in CCSNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 00:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

To produce the final mean opinion\nscores (MOS), recommendations such as ITU-R BT.500, ITU-T P.910 and ITU-T P.913\nstandardize post-test screening procedures to clean up the raw opinion scores,\nusing techniques such as subject outlier rejection and bias removal. In this\npaper, we analyze the prior standardized techniques to demonstrate their\nweaknesses. As an alternative, we propose a simple model to account for two of\nthe most dominant behaviors of subject inaccuracy: bias and inconsistency. We\nfurther show that this model can also effectively deal with inattentive\nsubjects that give random scores. We propose to use maximum likelihood\nestimation to jointly solve the model parameters, and present two numeric\nsolvers: the first based on the Newton-Raphson method, and the second based on\nan alternating projection (AP). We show that the AP solver generalizes the\nITU-T P.913 post-test screening procedure by weighing a subject's contribution\nto the true quality score by her consistency (thus, the quality scores\nestimated can be interpreted as bias-subtracted consistency-weighted MOS). We\ncompare the proposed methods with the standardized techniques using real\ndatasets and synthetic simulations, and demonstrate that the proposed methods\nare the most valuable when the test conditions are challenging (for example,\ncrowdsourcing and cross-lab studies), offering advantages such as better\nmodel-data fit, tighter confidence intervals, better robustness against subject\noutliers, the absence of hard coded parameters and thresholds, and auxiliary\ninformation on test subjects.

However, these results are based on the\nmodel where each job is an indivisible unit, which does not capture the\nparallel structure of jobs in today's predominant parallel computing paradigm.\n  This paper thus considers a model where each job consists of a batch of\nparallel tasks. Under this model, we propose a new notion of zero (asymptotic)\nqueueing delay that requires the job delay under a policy to approach the job\ndelay given by the max of its tasks' service times, i.e., the job delay\nassuming its tasks entered service right upon arrival. This notion quantifies\nthe effect of queueing on a job level for jobs consisting of multiple tasks,\nand thus deviates from the conventional zero queueing delay for single-task\njobs in the literature.\n  We show that zero queueing delay for parallel jobs can be achieved using the\nbatch-filling policy (a variant of the celebrated pod policy) with a probe\noverhead $d = \\omega\\left(\\frac{1}{(1-\\lambda)\\log k}\\right)$ in the\nsub-Halfin-Whitt heavy-traffic regime, where $k$ is the number of tasks in each\njob { and $k$ properly scales with $N$ (the number of servers)}.

Yet, they are constrained\nby their inability to generalise to different scale factors. This involves high\nstorage and energy costs as every integer scale factor involves a separate\nneural network. A recent paper has proposed a novel meta-learning technique\nthat uses a Weight Prediction Network to enable Super-Resolution on arbitrary\nscale factors using only a single neural network. In this paper, we propose a\nnew network that combines that technique with SRGAN, a state-of-the-art\nGAN-based architecture, to achieve arbitrary scale, high fidelity\nSuper-Resolution for medical images. By using this network to perform arbitrary\nscale magnifications on images from the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation\nChallenge (BraTS) dataset, we demonstrate that it is able to outperform\ntraditional interpolation methods by up to 20$\\%$ on SSIM scores whilst\nretaining generalisability on brain MRI images. We show that performance across\nscales is not compromised, and that it is able to achieve competitive results\nwith other state-of-the-art methods such as EDSR whilst being fifty times\nsmaller than them. Combining efficiency, performance, and generalisability,\nthis can hopefully become a new foundation for tackling Super-Resolution on\nmedical images.\n  Check out the webapp here: https://metasrgan.herokuapp.com/ Check out the\ngithub tutorial here: https://github.com/pancakewaffles/metasrgan-tutorial\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 03:53:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 02:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

Moreover, there's\ncurrently a demand for more empathetic computers to aid humans in applications\nsuch as augmenting the perception ability of visually and/or hearing impaired\npeople. Current approaches overlook the video's emotional characteristics in\nthe music generation step, only consider static images instead of videos, are\nunable to generate novel music, and require a high level of human effort and\nskills. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid deep neural network that uses\nan Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System to predict a video's emotion from its\nvisual features and a deep Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network to\ngenerate its corresponding audio signals with similar emotional inkling. The\nformer is able to appropriately model emotions due to its fuzzy properties, and\nthe latter is able to model data with dynamic time properties well due to the\navailability of the previous hidden state information. The novelty of our\nproposed method lies in the extraction of visual emotional features in order to\ntransform them into audio signals with corresponding emotional aspects for\nusers. Quantitative experiments show low mean absolute errors of 0.217 and\n0.255 in the Lindsey and DEAP datasets respectively, and similar global\nfeatures in the spectrograms. This indicates that our model is able to\nappropriately perform domain transformation between visual and audio features.\nBased on experimental results, our model can effectively generate audio that\nmatches the scene eliciting a similar emotion from the viewer in both datasets,\nand music generated by our model is also chosen more often.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 07:18:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

This\nstudy attempts to address the above issue from a different perspective and\nproposes an eigenspace divide-and-conquer (EDC) approach. Different from\nexisting DC-based algorithms that perform decomposition and optimization in the\noriginal decision space, EDC first establishes an eigenspace by conducting\nsingular value decomposition on a set of high-quality solutions selected from\nrecent generations.

Accordingly, these eigenvariables can be\nefficiently grouped by a simple random strategy and each of the resulting\nsubproblems can be addressed more easily by a traditional EA. To verify the\nefficiency of EDC, comprehensive experimental studies were conducted on two\nsets of benchmark functions.

The clue of the method is that scenario templates can be\ngenerated automatically from actual traffic situations. These templates can be\nemployed in all stages of the development process.

To handle such variations, we\npropose a novel module called anisotropic convolution, which properties with\nflexibility and power impossible for the competing methods such as standard 3D\nconvolution and some of its variations. In contrast to the standard 3D\nconvolution that is limited to a fixed 3D receptive field, our module is\ncapable of modeling the dimensional anisotropy voxel-wisely.

By stacking multiple such\nanisotropic convolution modules, the voxel-wise modeling capability can be\nfurther enhanced while maintaining a controllable amount of model parameters.\nExtensive experiments on two SSC benchmarks, NYU-Depth-v2 and NYUCAD, show the\nsuperior performance of the proposed method.

We then enroll this knowledge into the state-of-the-art\nself-supervised learning framework, and train one single network to estimate\nboth flow and stereo. Second, we unveil the bottlenecks in prior\nself-supervised learning approaches, and propose to create a new set of\nchallenging proxy tasks to boost performance. These two insights yield a single\nmodel that achieves the highest accuracy among all existing unsupervised flow\nand stereo methods on KITTI 2012 and 2015 benchmarks. More remarkably, our\nself-supervised method even outperforms several state-of-the-art fully\nsupervised methods, including PWC-Net and FlowNet2 on KITTI 2012.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 09:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

However, to speed up the model inference, current\napproaches almost always sacrifice the low-level details, which leads to a\nconsiderable accuracy decrease. We propose to treat these spatial details and\ncategorical semantics separately to achieve high accuracy and high efficiency\nfor realtime semantic segmentation. To this end, we propose an efficient and\neffective architecture with a good trade-off between speed and accuracy, termed\nBilateral Segmentation Network (BiSeNet V2). This architecture involves: (i) a\nDetail Branch, with wide channels and shallow layers to capture low-level\ndetails and generate high-resolution feature representation; (ii) a Semantic\nBranch, with narrow channels and deep layers to obtain high-level semantic\ncontext. The Semantic Branch is lightweight due to reducing the channel\ncapacity and a fast-downsampling strategy. Furthermore, we design a Guided\nAggregation Layer to enhance mutual connections and fuse both types of feature\nrepresentation. Besides, a booster training strategy is designed to improve the\nsegmentation performance without any extra inference cost. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed\narchitecture performs favourably against a few state-of-the-art real-time\nsemantic segmentation approaches.

If\nthis variation is physical, it can be interpreted either as a locally higher\nvalue of $H_0$, corresponding to a local matter underdensity $\\delta\n\\rho_0/\\rho_0 \\simeq -0.10 \\pm 0.04$ or as a time variation of Newton's\nconstant which implies an evolving Chandrasekhar mass and thus an evolving\nabsolute magnitude $M$ of SnIa. The local void scenario would predict an\nanisotropy in the best fit value of $H_0$ since it is unlikely that we are\nlocated at the center of a local spherical underdensity. Using a hemisphere\ncomparison method we find an anisotropy level consistent with simulated\nisotropic datasets. We show however, that the anisotropic sky distribution of\nthe Pantheon SnIa data induces a preferred range of directions even in\nsimulated Pantheon data obtained in the context of isotropic $\\Lambda$CDM. We\nthus construct a more isotropically distributed subset of the Pantheon SnIa and\nshow that the preferred range of directions disappears. Using this subset we\nagain find no evidence for anisotropy using either the hemisphere comparison\nmethod or the dipole fit method. In the context of the modified gravity\nscenario, we allow for an evolving normalized Newton's constant consistent with\nGeneral Relativity (GR) at early and late times $\\mu(z)=1+g_a z^2/(1+z)^2-g_a\nz^4/(1+z)^4$ and fit for $g_a$ assuming $L\\sim G_{\\rm{eff}}^b$. For $b=-3/2$\nindicated by previous studies we find $g_a=-0.47 \\pm 0.36$ which is more than\n$1.5\\sigma$ away from the GR value of $g_a=0$. This weak hint for weaker\ngravity at low $z$ is consistent with similar evidence from growth and weak\nlensing data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 10:52:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 13:53:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 10:49:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Aiming at this problem, grant-free\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA) protocol is proposed. In GF-NOMA,\nactive devices can directly transmit their preambles and data symbols\naltogether within one time frame, without grant from the AP. Compressive\nsensing (CS)-based receivers are adopted for non-orthogonal preambles\n(NOP)-based MUD, and successive interference cancellation is exploited to\ndecode the superimposed data signals. In this paper, we model, analyze, and\noptimize the CS-based GF-MONA mMTC system via stochastic geometry (SG), from an\naspect of network deployment.

We equip the space of these probability measures\nwith a divergence, i.e., a distance between probability distributions, and use\nthis divergence to define a kernel integral operator. The eigenfunctions of\nthis operator create an orthonormal basis of functions that capture different\ntimescales of the dynamical system. One of our main results shows that the\nevolution of the moments of the dynamics-dependent probability measures can be\nrelated to a time-averaging operator on the original dynamical system.

We investigate this problem using the SIR model for the epidemic\ndynamics, for which reduction of the epidemic peak $I_P$ can be achieved only\nat the price of increasing the time $t_P$ of its occurrence and its entire\ntime-span $t_E$. By means of a time reparametrization we linearize the\nequations for the SIR dynamics. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in\nthe time domain and to derive the scaling behaviour of the size, the timescale\nand the speed of the epidemics, by reducing the infection rate $\\alpha$ and by\nincreasing the removal rate $\\beta$ by a factor of $\\lambda$.

We\nidentify specifically three kinds of bound states. The first is a discrete\nbound state (DBS), of which the energy level exhibits a gap from the continuum.\nThe DBS exhibits the similar features of localization as the edge states in the\nsystem and thus can suppress the decay of system. The second is a bound state\nin the continuum (BIC), which can suppress the system decay too. It is found\nthat the BIC is intimately connected to the edge mode of the system since both\nof them show almost the same features of localization and energy. The third one\ndisplays a large gap from the continuum and behaves extendible (not localized).\nMoreover the population of the system on this state decays partly but not all\nof them does. This is different from the two former bound states. The time\nevolution of a single excitation in the system is studied in order to\nillustrate the influence of the bound states. We found that both DBS and BIC\nplay an important role in the time evolution, for example, the excitation\nbecomes localized and not decay depending on the overlap between the initial\nstate and the DBS or BIC. Furthermore we observe that the single excitation\ntakes a long-range hopping when the system falls into the regime of strong\nlocalizations. This feature can be understood as the interplay of system\nlocalizations and the bath-induced long-range correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 13:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

On the contrary,\nwe here demonstrate that an optimal noise level enhances the performance of\nspatial-photonic Ising machines on frustrated spin problems. By controlling the\nerror rate at the detection, we introduce a noisy-feedback mechanism in an\nIsing machine based on spatial light modulation. We investigate the device\nperformance on systems with hundreds of individually-addressable spins with\nall-to-all couplings and we found an increased success probability at a\nspecific noise level. The optimal noise amplitude depends on graph properties\nand size, thus indicating an additional tunable parameter helpful in exploring\ncomplex energy landscapes and in avoiding trapping into local minima. The\nresult points out noise as a resource for optical computing. This concept,\nwhich also holds in different nanophotonic neural networks, may be crucial in\ndeveloping novel hardware with optics-enabled parallel architecture for\nlarge-scale optimizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 14:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

Classifying a small size facial image into the right\nexpression category is still a challenging task. The main cause of this problem\nis the loss of discriminative feature due to reduced resolution.\nSuper-resolution method is often used to enhance low-resolution images, but the\nperformance on FER task is limited when on images of very low resolution. In\nthis work, inspired by feature super-resolution methods for object detection,\nwe proposed a novel generative adversary network-based feature level\nsuper-resolution method for robust facial expression recognition(FSR-FER). In\nparticular, a pre-trained FER model was employed as feature extractor, and a\ngenerator network G and a discriminator network D are trained with features\nextracted from images of low resolution and original high resolution. Generator\nnetwork G tries to transform features of low-resolution images to more\ndiscriminative ones by making them closer to the ones of corresponding\nhigh-resolution images. For better classification performance, we also proposed\nan effective classification-aware loss re-weighting strategy based on the\nclassification probability calculated by a fixed FER model to make our model\nfocus more on samples that are easily misclassified.

A\nconventional deep learning model is prone to privacy attacks that can recover\nthe sensitive information of individuals from either model parameters or\naccesses to the target model. Recently, differential privacy that offers\nprovable privacy guarantees has been proposed to train neural networks in a\nprivacy-preserving manner to protect training data. However, many approaches\ntend to provide the worst case privacy guarantees for model publishing,\ninevitably impairing the accuracy of the trained models. In this paper, we\npresent a novel private knowledge transfer strategy, where the private teacher\ntrained on sensitive data is not publicly accessible but teaches a student to\nbe publicly released. In particular, a three-player\n(teacher-student-discriminator) learning framework is proposed to achieve\ntrade-off between utility and privacy, where the student acquires the distilled\nknowledge from the teacher and is trained with the discriminator to generate\nsimilar outputs as the teacher. We then integrate a differential privacy\nprotection mechanism into the learning procedure, which enables a rigorous\nprivacy budget for the training. The framework eventually allows student to be\ntrained with only unlabelled public data and very few epochs, and hence\nprevents the exposure of sensitive training data, while ensuring model utility\nwith a modest privacy budget. The experiments on MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10\ndatasets show that our students obtain the accuracy losses w.r.t teachers of\n0.89%, 2.29%, 5.16%, respectively with the privacy bounds of (1.93, 10^-5),\n(5.02, 10^-6), (8.81, 10^-6).
