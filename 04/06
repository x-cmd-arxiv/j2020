The most common among\nthe information management strategies is Document Retrieval (DR) and\nInformation Filtering. DR systems may work as combine harvesters, which bring\nback useful material from the vast fields of raw material. With large amount of\npotentially useful information in hand, an Information Extraction (IE) system\ncan then transform the raw material by refining and reducing it to a germ of\noriginal text. A Document Retrieval system collects the relevant documents\ncarrying the required information, from the repository of texts. An IE system\nthen transforms them into information that is more readily digested and\nanalyzed. It isolates relevant text fragments, extracts relevant information\nfrom the fragments, and then arranges together the targeted information in a\ncoherent framework.

Tools for an uncomplicated identification of the most promising exomoon\ncandidates could be beneficial to streamline follow-up studies.} Here we study\nthree exomoon indicators that emerge if well-established planet-only models are\nfitted to a planet-moon transit light curve: transit timing variations (TTVs),\ntransit duration variations (TDVs), and apparent planetary transit radius\nvariations (TRVs). We re-evaluate under realistic conditions the previously\nproposed exomoon signatures in the TTV and TDV series. We simulate light curves\nof a transiting exoplanet with a single moon. These model light curves are then\nfitted with a planet-only transit model, pretending there were no moon, and we\nexplore the resulting TTV, TDV, and TRV series for evidence of the moon. The\npreviously described ellipse in the TTV-TDV diagram of an exoplanet with a moon\nemerges only for high-density moons. Low-density moons distort the sinusoidal\nshapes of the TTV and the TDV series due to their photometric contribution to\nthe combined planet-moon transit. Sufficiently large moons can produce periodic\napparent TRVs of their host planets that could be observable. We find that\nKepler and PLATO have similar performances in detecting the exomoon-induced TRV\neffect around simulated bright ($m_V=8$) stars. These stars, however, are rare\nin the Kepler sample but will be abundant in the PLATO sample. Moreover,\nPLATO's higher cadence yields a stronger TTV signal. The periodogram of the\nsequence of transit radius measurements can indicate the presence of a moon.\nThe TTV and TDV series of exoplanets with moons can be more complex than\npreviously assumed. We propose that TRVs could be a more promising means to\nidentify exomoons in large exoplanet surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 17:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

The solver incorporates state-of-the-art numerical algorithms,\nspecifically designed to cope with the challenging problems associated with the\nsolution of high-speed turbulent flows and can be used across a wide range of\nMach numbers, extending from the low subsonic up to the hypersonic regime. The\nuse of cuf automatic kernels allowed an easy and efficient porting on the GPU\narchitecture minimizing the changes to the original CPU code, which is also\nmaintained.

We experimentally\nstudy the scheme by protecting a collective excitation of an atomic ensemble,\nwhere inhomogeneous dephasing originates from thermal motion. Using photon\nstorage and retrieval, we demonstrate complete suppression of inhomogeneous\ndephasing and consequently a prolonged memory time.

Effects for women in same-sex couples and men in different-sex\ncouples are smaller than the associated effects for men in same-sex couples.\nThese findings confirm the broad effects of expanded dependent coverage and\nsuggest that eliminating the federal dependent mandate could reduce health\ninsurance coverage among young adult sexual minorities in same-sex couples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 19:59:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

Here, each end user is a\nlearning agent observing its local environment to learn optimal decisions on\neither local computing or edge computing with the goal of minimizing long term\nsystem cost by choosing its transmit power level, RAT and sub-channel without\nknowing any information of the other end users. Therefore, a multi-agent\nreinforcement learning framework is developed to solve the stochastic game with\na proposed independent learners based multi-agent Q-learning (IL-based MA-Q)\nalgorithm. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed IL-based MA-Q algorithm is\nfeasible to solve the formulated problem and is more energy efficient without\nextra cost on channel estimation at the centralized gateway compared to the\nother two benchmark algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 20:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

We argue that the\ngeneralization capability of learned features depends on what image\nneighborhood size is sufficient to discriminate different image\ntransformations: The larger the required neighborhood size and the more global\nthe image statistics that the feature can describe. An accurate description of\nglobal image statistics allows to better represent the shape and configuration\nof objects and their context, which ultimately generalizes better to new tasks\nsuch as object classification and detection. This suggests a criterion to\nchoose and design image transformations. Based on this criterion, we introduce\na novel image transformation that we call limited context inpainting (LCI).\nThis transformation inpaints an image patch conditioned only on a small\nrectangular pixel boundary (the limited context). Because of the limited\nboundary information, the inpainter can learn to match local pixel statistics,\nbut is unlikely to match the global statistics of the image. We claim that the\nsame principle can be used to justify the performance of transformations such\nas image rotations and warping. Indeed, we demonstrate experimentally that\nlearning to discriminate transformations such as LCI, image warping and\nrotations, yields features with state of the art generalization capabilities on\nseveral datasets such as Pascal VOC, STL-10, CelebA, and ImageNet.

One of\nthe isoscalar compressional modes -- the isoscalar giant monopole resonance\n(ISGMR) -- is useful in constraining the equation of state (EoS) of nuclear\nmatter. For example, the nuclear incompressibility, $K_\\infty$, is a\nfundamental quantity in the EoS and is directly correlated with the energies of\nthe ISGMR in finite nuclei.\n  Previous work has shown that interactions with $K_\\infty$ which reproduce the\nenergies of the ISGMR in $^{208}$Pb and $^{90}$Zr well, overestimate those of\nthe tin and cadmium nuclei. To further investigate where this \"softness\"\nappears in moving away from the doubly-closed nucleus $^{90}$Zr, and how this\neffect develops, the first portion of this thesis consists of measurements of\nthe ISGMR in the molybdenum isotopes. Comparison of the ISGMR strengths with\nRandom Phase Approximation calculations shows that these nuclei have ISGMR\nenergies which are overestimated to a similar degree as seen in the tin and\ncadmium nuclei, while the strength of $^{208}$Pb is precisely reproduced. This\nsuggests clearly that the molybdenum nuclei exhibit the same open-shell\nsoftness which has been documented previously.\n  The ISGMR in isotopes encompassing a broad range of proton-neutron\nasymmetries constrains the dependence of the nuclear incompressibility on the\nisospin asymmetry, as quantified by the asymmetry term, $K_\\tau$. To reconcile\npreviously-published and highly concerning conclusions that $K_\\tau = + 582$\nMeV, the second portion of this thesis is focused upon independently studying\nthis claim. A simultaneous measurement of the ISGMR in $^{40,42,44,48}$Ca has\nexcluded the possibility of a positive value for $K_\\tau$, and found\nconsistency with previous data, placing $K_\\tau$ at $-510 \\pm 115$ MeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 00:48:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Aug 2020 18:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

General purpose graph mining systems provide\na generic runtime to explore subgraph structures of interest with the help of\nuser-defined functions that guide the overall exploration process. However, the\nstate-of-the-art graph mining systems remain largely oblivious to the shape (or\npattern) of the subgraphs that they mine. This causes them to: (a) explore\nunnecessary subgraphs; (b) perform expensive computations on the explored\nsubgraphs; and, (c) hold intermediate partial subgraphs in memory; all of which\naffect their overall performance.

Under an approximate grid model, the perturbed power\ninjections and the collected voltage deviations obey a linear regression setup,\nwhere the unknown is the vector of line resistances. Building on this model,\ntopology processing can be performed in two steps. Given a candidate radial\ntopology, the line resistances can be estimated via a least-squares (LS) fit on\nthe probing data. The topology attaining the best fit can be then selected. To\navoid evaluating the exponentially many candidate topologies, this two-step\napproach is uniquely formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) using\nthe McCormick relaxation. If the recovered topology is not radial, a second,\ncomputationally more demanding MILP confines the search only within radial\ntopologies.

A major aim of this paper is to expand our theoretical knowledge of\nthe class of pair correlation functions or structure factors that are\nrealizable by classical disordered ensembles of particle configurations. We\nfirst introduce a theoretical formalism that provides a means to draw classical\nparticle configurations from canonical ensembles with certain pairwise-additive\npotentials that could correspond to targeted analytical functional forms for\nthe structure factor. This formulation enables us to devise an improved\nalgorithm to construct systematically canonical-ensemble particle\nconfigurations with such targeted pair statistics.

The\nsolution takes the form of an evolution operator, with the measurement-result\ndependence captured in $2N$ stochastic integrals over these classical random\nsignals. The solutions also allow the POVM, which generates the probabilities\nof obtaining measurement outcomes, to be determined. To illustrate our results,\nwe solve some single-mode example systems, with the POVMs being of practical\nrelevance to the inference of an initial state, via quantum state tomography.\nOur key tool is the representation of mixed states of quantum mechanical\noscillators as state vectors rather than state matrices (albeit in a larger\nHilbert space). Together with methods from Lie algebra, this allows a more\nstraightforward manipulation of the exponential operators comprising the system\nevolution than is possible in the original Hilbert space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 03:05:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 05:03:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 00:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

This paper presents a\nnew reliable and fast automatic calibration framework to address this issue. In\nessence, the proposed framework, adopting a divide and conquer strategy, first\npartitions the parameters into groups of different resolutions based on their\nsensitivity or importance, in which the most sensitive parameters are\nprioritized with highest resolution in parameter search space, while the least\nsensitive ones are explored with the coarsest resolution at beginning.

A key measure of the performance of a quantum gate is the\nminimum gate fidelity, i.e., the fidelity of the gate, minimized over all input\nstates. Conventionally, the minimum fidelity is estimated by first accurately\nreconstructing the full gate process matrix using the experimental procedure of\nquantum process tomography (QPT). Then, a numerical minimization is carried out\nto find the minimum fidelity. QPT is, however, well known to be costly, and it\nmight appear that we can do better, if the goal is only to estimate one single\nnumber. In this work, we propose a hybrid numerical-experimental scheme that\nemploys a numerical gradient-free minimization (GFM) and an experimental\ntarget-fidelity estimation procedure to directly estimate the minimum fidelity\nwithout reconstructing the process matrix. We compare this to an alternative\nscheme, referred to as QPT fidelity estimation, that does use QPT, but directly\nemploys the minimum gate fidelity as the termination criterion. Both approaches\ncan thus be considered as direct estimation schemes. General theoretical bounds\nsuggest a significant resource savings for the GFM scheme over QPT fidelity\nestimation; numerical simulations for specific classes of noise, however, show\nthat both schemes have similar performance, reminding us of the need for\ncaution when using general bounds for specific examples.

It\nis widely believed that finding an optimal scheduler is hard, and therefore\nmost studies have focused on developing algorithms with good processor\nutilization bounds. These algorithms can be broadly classified into two\ncategories: partitioned scheduling in which tasks are statically assigned to\nindividual processors, and global scheduling in which each task is allowed to\nexecute on any processor in the platform. In this paper we consider a third,\nmore general, approach called cluster-based scheduling. In this approach each\ntask is statically assigned to a processor cluster, tasks in each cluster are\nglobally scheduled among themselves, and clusters in turn are scheduled on the\nmultiprocessor platform. We develop techniques to support such cluster-based\nscheduling algorithms, and also consider properties that minimize total\nprocessor utilization of individual clusters. In the last part of this paper,\nwe develop new virtual cluster-based scheduling algorithms. For implicit\ndeadline sporadic task systems, we develop an optimal scheduling algorithm that\nis neither Pfair nor ERfair. We also show that the processor utilization bound\nof US-EDF{m/(2m-1)} can be improved by using virtual clustering. Since neither\npartitioned nor global strategies dominate over the other, cluster-based\nscheduling is a natural direction for research towards achieving improved\nprocessor utilization bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 07:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

In social learning, several distributed agents\nupdate continually their belief about a phenomenon of interest through: i)\ndirect observation of streaming data that they gather locally; and ii)\ndiffusion of their beliefs through local cooperation with their neighbors.\nTraditional social learning implementations are known to learn well the\nunderlying hypothesis (which means that the belief of every individual agent\npeaks at the true hypothesis), achieving steady improvement in the learning\naccuracy under stationary conditions. However, these algorithms do not perform\nwell under nonstationary conditions commonly encountered in online learning,\nexhibiting a significant inertia to track drifts in the streaming data. In\norder to address this gap, we propose an Adaptive Social Learning (ASL)\nstrategy, which relies on a small step-size parameter to tune the adaptation\ndegree. First, we provide a detailed characterization of the learning\nperformance by means of a steady-state analysis. Focusing on the small\nstep-size regime, we establish that the ASL strategy achieves consistent\nlearning under standard global identifiability assumptions. We derive reliable\nGaussian approximations for the probability of error (i.e., of choosing a wrong\nhypothesis) at each individual agent. We carry out a large deviations analysis\nrevealing the universal behavior of adaptive social learning: the error\nprobabilities decrease exponentially fast with the inverse of the step-size,\nand we characterize the resulting exponential learning rate. Second, we\ncharacterize the adaptation performance by means of a detailed transient\nanalysis, which allows us to obtain useful analytical formulas relating the\nadaptation time to the step-size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 08:55:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 08:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

These gas disks, mainly composed of CO, carbon, and oxygen\nseem to be ubiquitous in systems with planetesimal belts (similar to our Kuiper\nbelt), and can last for hundreds of millions of years. Planets orbiting in\nthese gas disks will accrete a large quantity of gas that will transform their\nprimordial atmospheres into new secondary atmospheres with compositions similar\nto that of the parent gas disk. Here, we quantify how large a secondary\natmosphere can be created for a variety of observed gas disks and for a wide\nrange of planet types. We find that gas accretion in this late phase is very\nsignificant and an Earth's atmospheric mass of gas is readily accreted on\nterrestrial planets in very tenuous gas disks. In slightly more massive disks,\nwe show that massive CO atmospheres can be accreted, forming planets with up to\nsub-Neptune-like pressures. Our new results demonstrate that new secondary\natmospheres with high metallicities and high C/O ratios will be created in\nthese late gas disks, resetting their primordial compositions inherited from\nthe protoplanetary disk phase, and providing a new birth to planets that lost\ntheir atmosphere to photoevaporation or giant impacts. We therefore propose a\nnew paradigm for the formation of atmospheres on low-mass planets, which can be\ntested with future observations (JWST, ELT, ARIEL). We also show that this late\naccretion would show a very clear signature in Sub-Neptunes or cold\nexo-Jupiters. Finally, we find that accretion creates cavities in late gas\ndisks, which could be used as a new planet detection method, for low mass\nplanets a few au to a few tens of au from their host stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 09:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

It is thought to have partial origin from\ninterstellar molecular clouds, which are near the beginning of the star\nformation cycle. Observational surveys of CH$_4$ ice towards low- and high-mass\nyoung stellar objects showed that much of the CH$_4$ is expected to be formed\nby the hydrogenation of C on dust grains, and that CH$_4$ ice is strongly\ncorrelated with solid H$_2$O.

In this study, we successfully\ndemonstrate with a C-atom beam implemented in an ultrahigh vacuum apparatus the\nformation of CH$_4$ ice in two separate co-deposition experiments: C + H on a\n10 K surface to mimic CH$_4$ formation right before H$_2$O ice is formed on the\ndust grain, and C + H + H$_2$O on a 10 K surface to mimic CH$_4$ formed\nsimultaneously with H$_2$O ice.

The latter, in which fibers collect the light from the\nside of the scintillator tiles, allows to place the light sensors away from the\ncore of the calorimeter, thus reducing possible irradiation damages with\nrespect to the shashlik design. This contribution will present the achievements\nof the prototyping activities carried out, together with irradiation tests made\non the Silicon Photo-Multipliers. The results achieved so far pin down the\ntechnology of choice for the construction of the 3 m long demonstrator that\nwill take data in 2021.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 10:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

The exploration of LSM topology for enhancing\nperformance often requires hyper-parameter search, which is both\nresource-expensive and time-consuming. We explore the influence of input scale\nreduction on LSM instead. There are two main reasons for studying input\nreduction of LSM. One is that the input dimension of large images requires\nefficient processing. Another one is that input exploration is generally more\neconomic than architecture search. To mitigate the difficulty in effectively\ndealing with huge input spaces of LSM, and to find that whether input reduction\ncan enhance LSM performance, we explore several input patterns, namely\nfullscale, scanline, chessboard, and patch. Several datasets have been used to\nevaluate the performance of the proposed input patterns, including two spatio\nimage datasets and one spatio-temporal image database.

A shock that propagates upwards in the solar atmosphere therefore\nundergoes a transition where the dominant fluid is either neutral or ionised.\nAn upwards propagating shock also passes a point where the sound and Alfv\\'en\nspeed are equal. At this point the energy of the acoustic shock can separated\ninto fast and slow components. How the energy is distributed between the two\nmodes depends on the angle of magnetic field. The separation of neutral and\nionised species in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere is investigated. The\nrole of two-fluid effects on the structure of the shocks post-mode-conversion\nand the frictional heating is quantified for different levels of collisional\ncoupling. Two-fluid numerical simulations are performed using the\n(P\\underline{I}P) code of a wave steepening into a shock in an isothermal,\npartially-ionised atmosphere. The collisional coefficient is varied to\ninvestigate the regimes where the plasma and neutral species are weakly,\nstrongly and finitely coupled.

A norm is deemed to have emerged\nwhen a threshold or predetermined percentage of agents follow the \"norm\".\nConversely, in normative MAS, norms are typically explicit and agents\ndeliberately share norms through communication or are informed about norms by\nan authority, following which an agent decides whether to adopt the norm or\nnot. The decision to adopt a norm by the agent can happen immediately after\nrecognition or when an applicable situation arises.

Road networks are\ndynamic in the sense that the weights of the edges in the corresponding graph\nconstantly change over time, representing evolving traffic conditions. Very\noften such services have to process numerous KSP queries over large road\nnetworks at the same time, thus there is a pressing need to identify\ndistributed solutions for this problem. However, most existing approaches are\ndesigned to identify KSPs on a static graph in a sequential manner (i.e., the\n(i+1)-th shortest path is generated based on the i-th shortest path),\nrestricting their scalability and applicability in a distributed setting. We\ntherefore propose KSP-DG, a distributed algorithm for identifying k-shortest\npaths in a dynamic graph. It is based on partitioning the entire graph into\nsmaller subgraphs, and reduces the problem of determining KSPs into the\ncomputation of partial KSPs in relevant subgraphs, which can execute in\nparallel on a cluster of servers. A distributed two-level index called DTLP is\ndeveloped to facilitate the efficient identification of relevant subgraphs. A\nsalient feature of DTLP is that it indexes a set of virtual paths that are\ninsensitive to varying traffic conditions, leading to very low maintenance cost\nin dynamic road networks. This is the first treatment of the problem of\nprocessing KSP queries over dynamic road networks.

They possess extremely large binding energies\n(>100~meV), dominating absorption and emission spectra even at high\ntemperatures. The large binding energies imply that they are stable, that is,\nhard to ionize, rendering them seemingly unsuited for optoelectronic devices\nthat require mobile charge carriers, especially terahertz emitters and solar\ncells. Here, we have conducted terahertz emission and photocurrent studies on\nfilms of aligned single-chirality semiconducting SWCNTs and find that excitons\nautoionize, i.e., spontaneously dissociate into electrons and holes. This\nprocess naturally occurs ultrafast (<1~ps) while conserving energy and\nmomentum. The created carriers can then be accelerated to emit a burst of\nterahertz radiation when a dc bias is applied, with promising efficiency in\ncomparison to standard GaAs-based emitters. Furthermore, at high bias, the\naccelerated carriers acquire high enough kinetic energy to create secondary\nexcitons through impact exciton generation, again in a fully energy and\nmomentum conserving fashion. This exciton multiplication process leads to a\nnonlinear photocurrent increase as a function of bias.

One current\nfocus is drug repurposing research, but those drugs have limited therapeutic\nefficacies and known adverse effects. The pathology of COVID-19 is essentially\nunknown. It is therefore challenging to discover a successful treatment to be\napproved for clinical use. This paper addresses several key biological\nprocesses of reactive oxygen, halogen and nitrogen species (ROS, RHS and RNS)\nthat play crucial physiological roles in organisms from plants to humans. These\ninclude why superoxide dismutases, the enzymes to catalyze the formation of\nH2O2, are required for protecting ROS-induced injury in cell metabolism, why\nthe amount of ROS/RNS produced by ionizing radiation at clinically relevant\ndoses is ~1000 fold lower than the endogenous ROS/RNS level routinely produced\nin the cell and why a low level of endogenous RHS plays a crucial role in\nphagocytosis for immune defense. Herein we propose a plausible amplification\nmechanism in immune defense: ozone-depleting-like halogen cyclic reactions\nenhancing RHS effects are responsible for all the mentioned physiological\nfunctions, which are activated by H2O2 and deactivated by NO signaling\nmolecule. Our results show that the reaction cycles can be repeated thousands\nof times and amplify the RHS pathogen-killing (defense) effects by 100,000 fold\nin phagocytosis, resembling the cyclic ozone-depleting reactions in the\nstratosphere. It is unraveled that H2O2 is a required protective signaling\nmolecule (angel) in the defense system for human health and its dysfunction can\ncause many diseases or conditions such as autoimmune disorders, aging and\ncancer.

Based on the Network Robustness index, we show that the\nmost efficient attack strategy shifts from a topological degree-based, for the\nall cities network, to a topological vulnerability-based, for a network\nconsidering the Brazilian States as nodes. Moreover, our results reveal that\nindividual municipalities' actions do not cause a high impact on mobility\nrestrain since they tend to be punctual and disconnected to the country scene\nas a whole. Oppositely, the coordinated isolation of specific cities is key to\ndetach entire network areas and thus prevent a spreading process to prevail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 13:13:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 09:11:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 20:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-10"}

The TeV gamma-ray\ndomain can be used to study particle acceleration in the multi-TeV and PeV\nrange. This motivates the study of the detectability of such supernovae by\ncurrent and future gamma-ray facilities. The gamma-ray emission of\ncore-collapse supernovae strongly depends on the level of the two-photon\nannihilation process: high-energy gamma-ray photons emitted at the expanding\nshock wave following the supernova explosion can interact with soft photons\nfrom the supernova photosphere through the pair production channel, thereby\nstrongly suppressing the flux of gamma rays leaving the system. In the case of\nSN 1993J, whose photospheric and shock-related parameters are well measured, we\ncalculate the temporal evolution of the expected gamma-ray attenuation by\naccounting for the temporal and geometrical effects. We find the attenuation to\nbe of about $10$ orders of magnitude in the first few days after the SN\nexplosion. The probability of detection of a supernova similar to SN 1993J with\nthe Cherenkov Telescope Array is highest if observations are performed either\nearlier than 1 day, or later than 10 days after the explosion, when the\ngamma-ray attenuation decreases to about $2$ orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 13:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

For\ninstance, a first-order transition exhibits latent heat and hysteresis when a\ncontrol parameter is increased and then decreased across a transition point,\nwhereas a second-order transition does not. Recently, hybrid percolation\ntransitions (HPTs) are issued in diverse complex systems, in which the features\nof first-order and second-order PTs occur at the same transition point. Thus,\nthe question whether hysteresis appears in an HPT arises. Herein, we\ninvestigate this fundamental question with a so-called restricted\nErd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi random network model, in which a cluster fragmentation\nprocess is additionally proposed. The hysteresis curve of the order parameter\nwas obtained.

Here we address the question of particle shape sensitivity\nfor the self-assembly of hard pear-shaped particles, by studying two models for\nthis system: a) the pear hard Gaussian overlap (PHGO) and b) hard pears of\nrevolution (HPR) model. Hard pear-shaped particles, given by the PHGO model,\nare known to form a bicontinuous gyroid phase spontaneously. However, this\nmodel does not replicate an additive object perfectly and, hence, varies\nslightly in shape from a \"true\" pear-shape. Therefore, we investigate in the\nfirst part of this series the stability of the gyroid phase in pear-shaped\nparticle systems. We show based on the HPR phase diagram that the gyroid phase\ndoes not form in pears with such \"true\" hard pear-shaped potential. Moreover,\nwe acquire first indications from the HPR and PHGO pair-correlation functions\nthat the formation of the gyroid is probably attributed to the small\nnon-additive properties of the PHGO potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 13:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

The\nLindblad equation contains two parameters, $\\omega$ and $\\kappa$, which adjust\nthe contributions of the quantum and classical effects, respectively. We find\nthat in one dimension when the QCP starts from a homogeneous state with all\nactive sites, there exists a critical line in the region $0 \\le \\kappa <\n\\kappa_*$ along which the exponent $\\alpha$ (which is associated with the\ndensity of active sites) decreases continuously from a quantum to the classical\ndirected percolation (DP) value. This behavior suggests that the quantum\ncoherent effect remains to some extent near $\\kappa=0$. However, when the QCP\nin one dimension starts from a heterogeneous state with all inactive sites\nexcept for one active site, all the critical exponents have the classical DP\nvalues for $\\kappa \\ge 0$. In two dimensions, anomalous crossover behavior does\nnot occur, and classical DP behavior appears in the entire region of $\\kappa\n\\ge 0$ regardless of the initial configuration.

The Immigration Game can be used in a model of evolution by\nnatural selection, where fitness is measured with competitions. The rules for\nthe Game of Life belong to the family of semitotalistic rules, a family with\n262,144 members. Woods' method for converting the Game of Life into a\ntwo-player game generalizes to 8,192 members of the family of semitotalistic\nrules.

Also, AI can improve work efficiency by\naccurate delination of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating\nsubsequent quantification.

Cooperated\nwith advancements in Deep Learning (DL), these learning models empower numerous\nuseful applications, e.g., image processing, speech recognition, healthcare,\nvehicular network and many more. Traditionally, Machine Learning (ML)\napproaches require data to be centralised in cloud-based data-centres. However,\nthis data is often large in quantity and privacy-sensitive which prevents\nlogging into these data-centres for training the learning models. In turn, this\nresults in critical issues of high latency and communication inefficiency.\nRecently, in light of new privacy legislations in many countries, the concept\nof Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced. In FL, mobile users are\nempowered to learn a global model by aggregating their local models, without\nsharing the privacy-sensitive data. Usually, these mobile users have slow\nnetwork connections to the data-centre where the global model is maintained.\nMoreover, in a complex and large scale network, heterogeneous devices that have\nvarious energy constraints are involved.

To this end, in this\nresearch, we begin with the fundamentals of FL, and then, we highlight the\nrecent FL algorithms and evaluate their communication efficiency with detailed\ncomparisons.

In order to improve the\nperformance of the E2E model, the locality and temporal sequential properties\nof speech should be efficiently taken into account when modelling. However, in\nmost current E2E models for SE, these properties are either not fully\nconsidered or are too complex to be realized. In this paper, we propose an\nefficient E2E SE model, termed WaveCRN. In WaveCRN, the speech locality feature\nis captured by a convolutional neural network (CNN), while the temporal\nsequential property of the locality feature is modeled by stacked simple\nrecurrent units (SRU). Unlike a conventional temporal sequential model that\nuses a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which is difficult to\nparallelize, SRU can be efficiently parallelized in calculation with even fewer\nmodel parameters. In addition, in order to more effectively suppress the noise\ncomponents in the input noisy speech, we derive a novel restricted feature\nmasking (RFM) approach that performs enhancement on the feature maps in the\nhidden layers; this is different from the approach that applies the estimated\nratio mask on the noisy spectral features, which is commonly used in speech\nseparation methods. Experimental results on speech denoising and compressed\nspeech restoration tasks confirm that with the lightweight architecture of SRU\nand the feature-mapping-based RFM, WaveCRN performs comparably with other\nstate-of-the-art approaches with notably reduced model complexity and inference\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 13:48:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2020 15:40:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 07:28:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}
