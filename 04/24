In this\npaper, we develop a new method called ensemble generative cleaning with\nfeedback loops (EGC-FL) for effective defense of deep neural networks. The\nproposed EGC-FL method is based on two central ideas. First, we introduce a\ntransformed deadzone layer into the defense network, which consists of an\northonormal transform and a deadzone-based activation function, to destroy the\nsophisticated noise pattern of adversarial attacks. Second, by constructing a\ngenerative cleaning network with a feedback loop, we are able to generate an\nensemble of diverse estimations of the original clean image. We then learn a\nnetwork to fuse this set of diverse estimations together to restore the\noriginal image. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our\napproach improves the state-of-art by large margins in both white-box and\nblack-box attacks. It significantly improves the classification accuracy for\nwhite-box PGD attacks upon the second best method by more than 29% on the SVHN\ndataset and more than 39% on the challenging CIFAR-10 dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 16:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-24"}

However, 3D systems require massive hardware due\nto the huge number of transducer elements and consequent data size. This\nincreases cost significantly and limits both frame rate and image quality, thus\npreventing 3D ultrasound from being common practice in clinics worldwide. A\nrecent study proposed a technique, called convolutional beamforming algorithm\n(COBA), which obtains improved image quality while allowing notable element\nreduction. COBA was developed and tested for 2D focused imaging using full and\nsparse arrays. The later was referred to as sparse COBA (SCOBA). In this paper,\nwe build upon previous work and introduce a nonlinear beamformer for 3D\nimaging, called COBA-3D, consisting of 2D spatial convolution of the in-phase\nand quadrature received signals. The proposed technique considers\ndiverging-wave transmission, thus, achieves improved image resolution and\ncontrast compared with standard delay-and-sum beamforming, while enabling high\nframe rate. Incorporating 2D sparse arrays into our method creates SCOBA-3D: a\nsparse beamformer which offers significant element reduction and thus allows to\nperform 3D imaging with the resources typically available for 2D setups. To\ncreate 2D thinned arrays, we present a scalable and systematic way to design 2D\nfractal sparse arrays. The proposed framework paves the way for affordable\nultrafast ultrasound devices that perform high-quality 3D imaging, as\ndemonstrated using phantom and ex-vivo data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 16:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-24"}

For example,\na self-adaptive cloud-based system may have a tactic that initiates additional\ncomputing resources when response time thresholds are surpassed, or there may\nbe a tactic to activate a specific security measure when an intrusion is\ndetected. In real-world environments, these tactics frequently experience\ntactic volatility which is variable behavior during the execution of the\ntactic.\n  Unfortunately, current self-adaptive approaches do not account for tactic\nvolatility in their decision-making processes, and merely assume that tactics\ndo not experience volatility. This limitation creates uncertainty in the\ndecision-making process and may adversely impact the system's ability to\neffectively and efficiently adapt. Additionally, many processes do not properly\naccount for volatility that may effect the system's Service Level Agreement\n(SLA). This can limit the system's ability to act proactively, especially when\nutilizing tactics that contain latency.\n  To address the challenge of sufficiently accounting for tactic volatility, we\npropose a Tactic Volatility Aware (TVA) solution. Using Multiple Regression\nAnalysis (MRA), TVA enables self-adaptive systems to accurately estimate the\ncost and time required to execute tactics. TVA also utilizes Autoregressive\nIntegrated Moving Average (ARIMA) for time series forecasting, allowing the\nsystem to proactively maintain specifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 16:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-24"}

An obvious way to improve automatic sleep\nstaging for longitudinal sleep monitoring is personalization of algorithms\nbased on individual characteristics extracted from the first night of data.

We employ the pretrained SeqSleepNet (i.e.\nthe subject independent model) as a starting point and finetune it with the\nsingle-night personalization data to derive the personalized model.

However, few effective\nways are known to detect the amount of entanglement of an unknown quantum\nstate. In this work, we propose a scheme to estimate the entanglement\nnegativity of any bi-partition of a composite system. The proposed scheme is\nbased on the random unitary evolution and local measurements on the single-copy\nquantum states, which is more practical compared with former methods based on\ncollective measurements on many copies of the identical state. Meanwhile, we\ngeneralize the scheme to quantify the total multi-partite correlation. We\ndemonstrate the efficiency of the scheme with theoretical statistical analysis\nand numerical simulations. The proposed scheme is quite suitable for\nstate-of-the-art quantum platforms, which can serve as not only a useful\nbenchmarking tool to advance the quantum technology, but also a probe to study\nfundamental quantum physics, such as the entanglement dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 17:57:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-26"}

In this work, we explore a\npopulation of 404 UDGs in the Coma cluster to study their origin and AGN\noccupation fraction. To constrain the formation scenario of UDGs, we probe the\nX-ray emission originating from diffuse gas and from the population of\nunresolved low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) residing in globular clusters (GCs).\nIt is expected that both the luminosity of the hot gas and the number of\nglobular clusters and hence the luminosity from GC-LMXBs are proportional to\nthe total dark matter halo mass. We do not detect statistically significant\nemission from the hot gas or from GC-LMXBs. The upper limits on the X-ray\nluminosities suggest that the bulk of the UDGs reside in low-mass dark matter\nhalos, implying that they are genuine dwarf galaxies. This conclusion agrees\nwith our previous results obtained for isolated UDGs, arguing that UDGs are a\nhomogenous population of galaxies. To probe the AGN occupation fraction of\nUDGs, we cross-correlate the position of detected X-ray sources in the Coma\ncluster with the position of UDGs. We identify two UDGs that have a luminous\nX-ray source at 3.0\" and 3.2\" from the center of the galaxies, which could be\noff-center AGN.

Known constructions of such bounded\ndegree two-dimensional expander families are obtained from deep algebraic\nreasonings (e.g. coset geometries).\n  We show that given a small $d$-regular two-dimensional $\\epsilon$-expander,\nthere exists an $\\epsilon'=\\epsilon'(\\epsilon)$ and a family of bounded degree\ntwo-dimensional simplicial complexes with a number of vertices goes to\ninfinity, such that each complex in the family satisfies the following\nproperties:\n  * It is $4d$-regular.\n  * The link of each vertex in the complex is the same regular graph (up to\nisomorphism).\n  * It is $\\epsilon'$ expanding.\n  * It is transitive.\n  The family of expanders that we get is explicit if the one-skeleton of the\nsmall complex is a complete multipartite graph, and it is random in the case of\n(almost) general $d$-regular complex. For the randomized construction, we use\nresults on expanding generators in a product of simple Lie groups. This\nconstruction is inspired by ideas that occur in the zig-zag product for graphs.\nIt can be seen as a loose two-dimensional analog of the replacement product.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 19:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-27"}

This problem is of significant interest due to its\nrelationship to other fundamental robot coordination problems, such as\nexploration, scattering, load balancing, relocation of self-driving electric\ncars to recharge stations, etc. The robots have unique IDs, typically in the\nrange $[1,poly(n)]$ and limited memory, whereas the graph is anonymous, i.e.,\nthe nodes do not have identifiers. The objective is to simultaneously minimize\ntwo performance metrics: (i) time to achieve dispersion and (ii) memory\nrequirement at each robot. This problem has been relatively well-studied when\nrobots are non-faulty.\n  In this paper, we introduce the notion of Byzantine faults to this problem,\ni.e., we formalize the problem of dispersion in the presence of up to $f$\nByzantine robots.

Second we give a\n$2$-approximation algorithm for the girth of unweighted graphs running in\n$\\tilde{O}(mn^{3/4})$ time, and a $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm (for\nany $\\epsilon>0$) that works in weighted graphs and runs in $\\tilde{O}(m\\sqrt\nn)$ time. Our algorithms are combinatorial.\n  We also obtain a $(4+\\epsilon)$-approximation of the girth running in\n$\\tilde{O}(mn^{\\sqrt{2}-1})$ time, improving upon the previous best\n$\\tilde{O}(m\\sqrt n)$ running time by Chechik et al. Finally, we consider the\ncomputation of roundtrip spanners. We obtain a $(5+\\epsilon)$-approximate\nroundtrip spanner on $\\tilde{O}(n^{1.5}/\\epsilon^2)$ edges in $\\tilde{O}(m\\sqrt\nn/\\epsilon^2)$ time. This improves upon the previous approximation factor\n$(8+\\epsilon)$ of Chechik et al. for the same running time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 20:07:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 01:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

The database was\nanalysed using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) to identify\nenergetically dominant coherent structures, most of which turn out to be\nstreaks and quasi-streamwise vortices. To understand how such structures can be\nmodelled, the linear flow responses to harmonic forcing were computed using the\nsingular value decomposition of the resolvent operator, using the mean field as\na base flow. The SPOD and resolvent analysis were calculated for several\ncombinations of frequencies and wavenumbers, allowing to map out the\nsimilarities between SPOD modes and optimal responses for a wide range of\nrelevant scales in turbulent pipe flows. In order to explore physical reasons\nbehind the agreement between both methods, an indicator of lift-up mechanism in\nthe resolvent analysis was introduced, activated when optimal forcing\nrepresents quasi-streamwise vortices and associated response corresponds to\nstreaks. Good agreement between leading SPOD and resolvent modes is observed in\na large region of parameter space. In this region, a significant gain\nseparation is found in resolvent analysis, which may be attributed to the\nstrong amplification associated with the lift-up mechanism. For both Reynolds\nnumbers, the observed concordances were generally for structures with large\nenergy in the buffer layer.

The Poisson distribution has been successfully\napplied in text classification, but its application to topic modelling is not\nwell documented, specifically in the context of a generative probabilistic\nmodel. Furthermore, the few Poisson topic models in literature are admixture\nmodels, making the assumption that a document is generated from a mixture of\ntopics. In this study, we focus on short text. Many studies have shown that the\nsimpler assumption of a mixture model fits short text better. With mixture\nmodels, as opposed to admixture models, the generative assumption is that a\ndocument is generated from a single topic. One topic model, which makes this\none-topic-per-document assumption, is the Dirichlet-multinomial mixture model.\nThe main contributions of this work are a new Gamma-Poisson mixture model, as\nwell as a collapsed Gibbs sampler for the model.

Our\nalgorithm successfully recognized unique events in those cases where they were\nalready known such as the gravitational waves of a binary black hole merger on\nLIGO detector data and the signs of respiratory failure on ECG data series.\nFurthermore, unique events were found on the LIBOR data set of the last 30\nyears.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 21:38:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 14:58:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 09:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

The existing research in\nactivity detection is mainly focused on datasets, such as UCF-101, JHMDB,\nTHUMOS, and AVA, which partially address these issues. The requirement of\nprocessing the security videos in real-time makes this even more challenging.\nIn this work we propose Gabriella, a real-time online system to perform\nactivity detection on untrimmed security videos. The proposed method consists\nof three stages: tubelet extraction, activity classification, and online\ntubelet merging. For tubelet extraction, we propose a localization network\nwhich takes a video clip as input and spatio-temporally detects potential\nforeground regions at multiple scales to generate action tubelets. We propose a\nnovel Patch-Dice loss to handle large variations in actor size. Our online\nprocessing of videos at a clip level drastically reduces the computation time\nin detecting activities. The detected tubelets are assigned activity class\nscores by the classification network and merged together using our proposed\nTubelet-Merge Action-Split (TMAS) algorithm to form the final action\ndetections. The TMAS algorithm efficiently connects the tubelets in an online\nfashion to generate action detections which are robust against varying length\nactivities. We perform our experiments on the VIRAT and MEVA (Multiview\nExtended Video with Activities) datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed approach in terms of speed (~100 fps) and performance with\nstate-of-the-art results.

Attackers add carefully-crafted\nperturbations to input, where the perturbations are almost imperceptible to\nhumans, but can cause models to make wrong predictions. Techniques to protect\nmodels against adversarial input are called adversarial defense methods.\nAlthough many approaches have been proposed to study adversarial attacks and\ndefenses in different scenarios, an intriguing and crucial challenge remains\nthat how to really understand model vulnerability? Inspired by the saying that\n\"if you know yourself and your enemy, you need not fear the battles\", we may\ntackle the aforementioned challenge after interpreting machine learning models\nto open the black-boxes. The goal of model interpretation, or interpretable\nmachine learning, is to extract human-understandable terms for the working\nmechanism of models. Recently, some approaches start incorporating\ninterpretation into the exploration of adversarial attacks and defenses.\nMeanwhile, we also observe that many existing methods of adversarial attacks\nand defenses, although not explicitly claimed, can be understood from the\nperspective of interpretation. In this paper, we review recent work on\nadversarial attacks and defenses, particularly from the perspective of machine\nlearning interpretation. We categorize interpretation into two types,\nfeature-level interpretation and model-level interpretation. For each type of\ninterpretation, we elaborate on how it could be used for adversarial attacks\nand defenses. We then briefly illustrate additional correlations between\ninterpretation and adversaries. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future\ndirections along tackling adversary issues with interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 23:19:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 15:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-08"}

After measuring, and then correcting\nfor the pulsar's rotation measure of $1442.0 \\pm 0.2$ rad m$^{-2}$, we find the\nradio profile is between 80-100 per cent linearly polarized across the wide\nobserving band, with a small amount of depolarization at low frequencies that\nwe ascribe to scatter broadening. We also measure a steep spectral index of\n$\\alpha = -2.26^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$ across our large frequency range, a\nsignificant deviation from the flat or inverted spectra often associated with\nradio-loud magnetars. The steep spectrum and temporal rise in flux density\nbears some resemblance to the behaviour of the magnetar-like, rotation-powered\npulsar PSR J1119$-$6127.

Literature shows the interactions\nbetween innovation adopters and potential adopters have significant impacts on\ninnovation diffusion. Enterprises lack the motivation to share information, and\nEETs usually lack observability, which suppress the inter-firm influence.\nTherefore, an information platform, together with proper policies encouraging\nor forcing enterprises to disclose EET-related information, should help harness\ninter-firm influence to accelerate EETs' diffusion.

Based on a series of controlled numerical experiments, some\ncounter-intuitive phenomena are discovered and explained.

Increasing network\ndensity and the intensity of inter-firm influence are effective to speed EET\ndiffusion, but their impacts diminish drastically after reaching some critical\nvalues (0.05 and 0.15 respectively) and eventually harm the stability of the\nsystem. Hence, the findings implicate that EET suppliers should carefully\nlaunch their promising but immature products; policies that can reduce the\nperceived risk by enterprises and the effort to maintain an informative rather\nthan judgmental information platform can prominently mitigate the negative side\neffects brought by high fluidity of information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 05:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-27"}

However, the current state-of-the-art DL\nsoftware still suffers from quality issues, which raises great concern\nespecially in the context of safety- and security-critical scenarios.\nAdversarial examples (AEs) represent a typical and important type of defects\nneeded to be urgently addressed, on which a DL software makes incorrect\ndecisions. Such defects occur through either intentional attack or\nphysical-world noise perceived by input sensors, potentially hindering further\nindustry deployment. The intrinsic uncertainty nature of deep learning\ndecisions can be a fundamental reason for its incorrect behavior. Although some\ntesting, adversarial attack and defense techniques have been recently proposed,\nit still lacks a systematic study to uncover the relationship between AEs and\nDL uncertainty. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study towards bridging\nthis gap. We first investigate the capability of multiple uncertainty metrics\nin differentiating benign examples (BEs) and AEs, which enables to characterize\nthe uncertainty patterns of input data. Then, we identify and categorize the\nuncertainty patterns of BEs and AEs, and find that while BEs and AEs generated\nby existing methods do follow common uncertainty patterns, some other\nuncertainty patterns are largely missed. Based on this, we propose an automated\ntesting technique to generate multiple types of uncommon AEs and BEs that are\nlargely missed by existing techniques. Our further evaluation reveals that the\nuncommon data generated by our method is hard to be defended by the existing\ndefense techniques with the average defense success rate reduced by 35\\%. Our\nresults call for attention and necessity to generate more diverse data for\nevaluating quality assurance solutions of DL software.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 07:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-27"}

Such distribution change in streaming data is called concept drift.\nNumerous histogram-based distribution change detection methods have been\nproposed to detect drift. Most histograms are developed on grid-based or\ntree-based space partitioning algorithms which makes the space partitions\narbitrary, unexplainable, and may cause drift blind-spots. There is a need to\nimprove the drift detection accuracy for histogram-based methods with the\nunsupervised setting. To address this problem, we propose a cluster-based\nhistogram, called equal intensity k-means space partitioning (EI-kMeans). In\naddition, a heuristic method to improve the sensitivity of drift detection is\nintroduced. The fundamental idea of improving the sensitivity is to minimize\nthe risk of creating partitions in distribution offset regions. Pearson's\nchi-square test is used as the statistical hypothesis test so that the test\nstatistics remain independent of the sample distribution. The number of bins\nand their shapes, which strongly influence the ability to detect drift, are\ndetermined dynamically from the sample based on an asymptotic constraint in the\nchi-square test. Accordingly, three algorithms are developed to implement\nconcept drift detection, including a greedy centroids initialization algorithm,\na cluster amplify-shrink algorithm, and a drift detection algorithm. For drift\nadaptation, we recommend retraining the learner if a drift is detected. The\nresults of experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the\nadvantages of EI-kMeans and show its efficacy in detecting concept drift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 08:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

Analysis through the driven-dissipative stochastic\nGross-Pitaevskii equation reveals that this depolarization stems from a\ncompetition between sample induced in-plane polarization splitting and the\ncondensate-reservoir overlap. An increase in the role of the latter results in\nweakening of the condensate fixed-point phase space attractors, and enhanced\nrandom phase space walk and appearance of limit cycle trajectories, reducing\nthe degree of time-integrated polarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 09:17:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 13:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

In such scenarios, a tracking system\nis necessary to ensure an acceptable signal power. Free space optical links\nwere considered unable to support optical mobile communication when nodes are\nrandomly moving at a high speed because existing tracking schemes fail to track\nthe nodes accurately and rapidly. In this paper, we propose a novel tracking\nsystem exploiting multiple beacon laser sources. At the receiver, each beacon\nlaser's power is measured to estimate the orientation of the target. Unlike\nexisting schemes which drive servo motors multiple times based on consecutive\nmeasurements and feedback, our scheme can directly estimate the next optimal\ntargeting shift for the servo motors based on a single measurement, allowing\nthe tracking system to converge much faster. Closed-form outage probability\nexpression is derived for the optical mobile communication system with ideal\ntracking, where pointing error and moving statistics are considered. To\nmaintain sufficient average power and reduce the outage probability, the\nrecommended size of a source spot is expressed in closed form as a function of\nthe target's statistics of random moving, providing insights to the system\ndesign.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 09:21:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-27"}

We used four different excitation wavelengths in the range from the\nonset of the CdS shell absorption to well above the CdS shell band edge to get\ninsight into resonance effects of the CdS LO phonon with high energy excitonic\ntransitions. The isotropic spherical giant-shell nanocrystals show consistently\nstronger exciton-phonon coupling as compared to the anisotropic rod-shaped\ndot-in-rod (DiR) architecture, and the 2LO/LO intensity ratio decreases for\nexcitation wavelengths approaching the CdS band edge.

However, towards embedding nanocrystals\nfilms in elaborated device geometries, one significant drawback is the\nsensitivity of their emission properties on further fabrication processes like\nlithography, metal or oxide deposition, etc. In this work, we demonstrate how\nbright emitting and robust thin films can be obtained by combining nanocrystal\ndeposition from solutions via spin2 coating with subsequent atomic layer\ndeposition of alumina. For the resulting composite films, the layer thickness\ncan be controlled on the nanoscale, and their refractive index can be finely\ntuned by the amount of deposited alumina. Ellipsometry is used to measure the\nreal and imaginary part of the dielectric permittivity, which gives direct\naccess to the wavelength dependent refractive index absorbance of the film.\nDetailed analysis of the photophysics of thin films of core-shell nanocrystal\nwith different shape and different shell thickness allow to correlate the\nbehavior of the photoluminescence and of the decay life time to the changes in\nthe non-radiative rate that are induced by the alumina deposition. We show that\nthe photoemission properties of such composite films are stable in wavelength\nand intensity over several months, and that the photoluminescence completely\nrecovers from heating processes up to 240$^\\circ$C. The latter is particularly\ninteresting, since it demonstrates robustness to the typical heat treatment\nthat is needed in several process steps like resist-based lithography and\ndeposition by thermal or electron beam evaporation of metals or oxides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 10:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-27"}

On the other hand, the\nelectrical properties of NC films are dominated by the ligands that constitute\nthe barriers for charge transport from one NC to its neighbor. Therefore,\nsurface modifications via ligandexchange have been employed to improve the\nconductance of NC films.

Namely, we\ngive an algorithm which given any $c>0$, $\\epsilon>0$, distinguishes between 1.\n$f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\{-1,1\\}$ has correlation at least $c$ with some\nlinear $k$-junta with surface area $s$. 2. $f$ has correlation at most\n$c-\\epsilon$ with any linear $k$-junta with surface area at most $s$. The query\ncomplexity of our tester is $k^{\\mathsf{poly}(s/\\epsilon)}$.\n  Using our techniques, we also obtain a fully noise tolerant tester with the\nsame query complexity for any class $\\mathcal{C}$ of linear $k$-juntas with\nsurface area bounded by $s$. As a consequence, we obtain a fully noise tolerant\ntester with query complexity $k^{O(\\mathsf{poly}(\\log k/\\epsilon))}$ for the\nclass of intersection of $k$-halfspaces (for constant $k$) over the Gaussian\nspace. Our query complexity is independent of the ambient dimension $n$.\nPreviously, no non-trivial noise tolerant testers were known even for a single\nhalfspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 10:23:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 22:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

We discuss a new way\nof using time delays for cosmology, taking advantage of the extreme precision\nexpected for lensed fast radio bursts (FRBs), which are short flashes of radio\nemission originating at cosmological distances. With coherent methods, the\nachievable precision is sufficient for measuring how time delays change over\nthe months and years, which can also be interpreted as differential redshifts\nbetween the images. It turns out that uncertainties arising from the unknown\nmass distribution of gravitational lenses can be eliminated by combining time\ndelays with their time derivatives. Other effects, most importantly relative\nproper motions, can be measured accurately and disentangled from the\ncosmological effects. With a mock sample of simulated lenses, we show that it\nmay be possible to attain strong constraints on cosmological parameters.\nFinally, the lensed images can be used as galactic interferometer to resolve\nstructures and motions of the burst sources with incredibly high resolution and\nhelp reveal their physical nature, which is currently unknown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 10:25:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 14:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-18"}

We argue that these observations are only partially compatible\nwith the previously proposed crystal structure of BCO.

On the other hand, recent calculations of the reactor neutrino\nflux predict percent-level sub-structures in the $\\bar\\nu_e$ spectrum due to\nCoulomb effects in beta decay. Such fine structure in the reactor spectrum\ncould be an important issue for the determination of neutrino MH for the MBRO\napproach since they could affect the sub-dominant oscillation pattern used to\ndiscriminate different hierarchies. Inconveniently, the energy resolutions of\ncurrent reactor experiments are not sufficient to measure such fine structure,\nand therefore the size and location in energy of these predicted\ndiscontinuities has not been confirmed experimentally.

The development towards\ncloud and edge native infrastructures is expected to continue in 6G networks,\nand we need holistic 6G network security architecture planning.

Most of the theoretical studies so far focused on instantaneous\nresetting which is, however, a major impediment to practical realization or\nexperimental verification in the field. This is because in the real world,\ntaking a particle from one place to another requires finite time and thus a\ngeneralization of the existing theory to incorporate non-instantaneous\nresetting is very much in need. In this paper, we propose a method of resetting\nwhich involves non-instantaneous returns facilitated by an external confining\ntrap potential $U(x)$ centered at the resetting location. We consider a\nBrownian particle that starts its random motion from the origin. Upon\nresetting, the trap is switched on and the particle starts experiencing a force\ntowards the center of the trap which drives it to return to the origin.

Here we present a versatile semi-analytical framework for\nstudying the elastohydrodynamics of axisymmetric loading of a rigid sphere near\na soft elastic substrate coated on a rigid platform mediated by an aqueous\nelectrolytic solution. Three loading modes are considered - approach, recession\nand oscillatory.

Motivated by this observation, we propose a\nnovel, simple, yet effective formulation aiming at extremely fast speed and\nchallenging scenarios.

Fortunately the Gr\\\"obner\nbasis of a same polynomial system with different coefficients is found to share\nconsistent inner structure. By precomputing such structures offline, Gr\\\"obner\nbasis as well as the polynomial system solutions can be solved automatically\nand efficiently online. In the past decade, several tools have been released to\ngenerate automatic solvers for a general minimal problems. The most recent tool\nautogen from Larsson et al. is a representative of these tools with\nstate-of-the-art performance in solver efficiency. GAPS wraps and improves\nautogen with more user-friendly interface, more functionality and better\nstability. We demonstrate in this report the main approach and enhancement\nfeatures of GAPS.

Zonal reserve procurement\nmitigates such inefficiencies, however, the way the zones are defined is still\nopen to interpretation. This paper challenges the efficiency of predetermined\nzonal setups that neglect the location of stochastic power production in the\nsystem, as well as the availability, cost and accessibility of flexible\ngenerating units. To this end, we propose a novel reserve procurement approach,\nformulated as a two-stage stochastic bilevel model, in which the upper level\nidentifies a number of contiguous reserve zones using dynamic grid partitioning\nand sets zonal requirements based on the total expected operating costs. Using\ntwo standard IEEE reliability test cases, we show how the efficient\npartitioning of reserve zones can reduce expected system cost and promote the\nintegration of stochastic renewables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 15:44:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-27"}

For long-distance navigation on the surface of the earth or in\nouter space however, approximating the geometry as Euclidean can be\ninsufficient for real-world applications such as the navigation of spacecraft,\naeroplanes, drones and ships. This article describes an any-angle pathfinding\nalgorithm for calculating the shortest path between point pairs over the\nsurface of a sphere. Introducing several novel adaptations, it is shown that\nAnya as described by (Harabor & Grastien, 2013) for Euclidean space can be\nextended to Spherical geometry. There, where the shortest-distance line between\ncoordinates is defined instead by a great-circle path, the optimal solution is\ntypically a curved line in Euclidean space. In addition the turning points for\noptimal paths in Spherical geometry are not necessarily corner points as they\nare in Euclidean space, as will be shown, making further substantial\nadaptations to Anya necessary. Spherical Anya returns the optimal path on the\nsphere, given these different properties of world maps defined in Spherical\ngeometry. It preserves all primary benefits of Anya in Euclidean geometry,\nnamely the Spherical Anya algorithm always returns an optimal path on a sphere\nand does so entirely on-line, without any preprocessing or large memory\noverheads. Performance benchmarks are provided for several game maps including\nStarcraft and Warcraft III as well as for sea navigation on Earth using the\nNOAA bathymetric dataset.

Methods: 1280\nAS-OCT B-scans were annotated by a DMEK expert. Using the annotations, a deep\nlearning pipeline was developed to localize scleral spur, center the AS-OCT\nB-scans and segment the detached graft sections. Detachment segmentation model\nperformance was evaluated per B-scan by comparing (1) length of detachment and\n(2) horizontal projection of the detached sections with the expert annotations.\nHorizontal projections were used to construct graft detachment maps. All final\nevaluations were done on a test set that was set apart during training of the\nmodels. A second DMEK expert annotated the test set to determine inter-rater\nperformance. Results: Mean scleral spur localization error was 0.155 mm,\nwhereas the inter-rater difference was 0.090 mm. The estimated graft detachment\nlengths were in 69% of the cases within a 10-pixel (~150{\\mu}m) difference from\nthe ground truth (77% for the second DMEK expert).

Conclusion: Our deep\nlearning model can be used to automatically and instantly localize graft\ndetachment in AS-OCT B-scans. Horizontal detachment projections can be\ndetermined with the same accuracy as a human DMEK expert, allowing for the\nconstruction of accurate graft detachment maps.

We describe how to match\nthe optical path lengths between all shells in a compact mirror assembly, and\ninvestigate chromatic and off-axis aberrations. Chromatic aberration results\nfrom total external reflection off of mirror surfaces, and we greatly mitigate\nits effects by slightly adjusting the path lengths in each mirror shell. The\nmirror surface height error and alignment requirements for diffraction-limited\nperformance are challenging but arguably achieveable in the coming decades.\nSince the focal ratio for a diffraction-limited X-ray telescope is extremely\nlarge ($f/D$~10$^5$), the only important off-axis aberration is curvature of\nfield, so a 1 arcsecond field of view is feasible with a flat detector. The\ndetector must fly in formation with the mirror assembly, but relative\npositioning tolerances are on the order of 1 m over a distance of some tens to\nhundreds of kilometers. While there are many challenges to achieving\ndiffraction-limited X-ray imaging, we did not find any fundamental barriers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 13:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

The\nundesirable severe drop in accuracy adversely affects the reliability of\nmachine learning algorithms and prohibits their deployment in realistic\napplications. This paper aims to address this dilemma by proposing a novel\npreprocessing framework, which we term Robust and Accurate Image\nclassificatioN(RAIN), to improve the robustness of given CNN classifiers and,\nat the same time, preserve their high prediction accuracies. RAIN introduces a\nnew randomization-enhancement scheme. It applies randomization over inputs to\nbreak the ties between the model forward prediction path and the backward\ngradient path, thus improving the model robustness. However, similar to\nexisting preprocessing-based methods, the randomized process will degrade the\nprediction accuracy. To understand why this is the case, we compare the\ndifference between original and processed images, and find it is the loss of\nhigh-frequency components in the input image that leads to accuracy drop of the\nclassifier. Based on this finding, RAIN enhances the input's high-frequency\ndetails to retain the CNN's high prediction accuracy. Concretely, RAIN consists\nof two novel randomization modules: randomized small circular shift (RdmSCS)\nand randomized down-upsampling (RdmDU). The RdmDU module randomly downsamples\nthe input image, and then the RdmSCS module circularly shifts the input image\nalong a randomly chosen direction by a small but random number of pixels.\nFinally, the RdmDU module performs upsampling with a detail-enhancement model,\nsuch as deep super-resolution networks. We conduct extensive experiments on the\nSTL10 and ImageNet datasets to verify the effectiveness of RAIN against various\ntypes of adversarial attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 02:03:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 11:34:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 16:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 13:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-05"}

Moreover, we enhance BBC using the robust semantics of STL\nformulas, which is the essential gadget in falsification. Our experiment\nresults suggest that our robustness-guided BBC outperforms a state-of-the-art\nfalsification tool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 09:51:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 05:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

Due to their crewed\nnature, size, and long trip times, the feasibility of world ships faces an\nadditional set of challenges compared to interstellar probes. Despite their\nemergence in the 1980s, most of these topics remain unexplored. This article\nrevisits some of the key feasibility issues of world ships. First, definitions\nof world ships from the literature are revisited and the notion of world ship\npositioned with respect to similar concepts such as generation ships. Second,\nthe key question of population size is revisited in light of recent results\nfrom the literature. Third, socio-technical and economic feasibility issues are\nevaluated. Finally, world ships are compared to potential alternative modes of\ncrewed interstellar travel. Key roadblocks for world ships are the considerable\nresources required, shifting its economic feasibility beyond the year 2300, and\nthe development of a maintenance system capable of detecting, replacing, and\nrepairing several components per second. The emergence of alternative, less\ncostly modes of crewed interstellar travel at an earlier point in time might\nrender world ships obsolete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 20:33:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 11:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

The\nprediction of properties like the glass-forming ability (GFA) by using the\nvariation in alloy composition remains to be a challenging problem in the field\nof material sciences. It also results in significant financial concerns for the\nmanufacturing industry. Despite the existence of various empirical guides for\nthe prediction of GFA, a comprehensive prediction model is still highly\ndesirable. This work focuses on studying some of the popular machine learning\nalgorithms for the prediction of the reduced glass transition temperature (Trg)\nof material compositions. From the experimentation, we conclude that the\nensemble model performs better for predicting Trg. This result can prove\ninstrumental in the branch of material sciences by helping us to develop\nmaterials having remarkable properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 16:45:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

Phase shifters integrated in the photonic\ncircuit offer the possibility to dynamically reconfigure its properties in\norder to fine tune its operation or to produce adaptive circuits, thus greatly\nextending the quality and the applicability of these devices. In this paper, we\nprovide a thorough discussion of the main problems that one can encounter when\nusing thermal shifters to reconfigure photonic circuits. We then show how all\nthese issues can be solved by a careful design of the thermal shifters and by\nchoosing the most appropriate way to drive them. Such performance improvement\nis demonstrated by manufacturing thermal phase shifters in femtosecond laser\nwritten PICs (FLW-PICs), and by characterizing their operation in detail. The\nunprecedented results in terms of power dissipation, miniaturization and\nstability, enable the scalable implementation of reconfigurable FLW-PICs that\ncan be easily calibrated and exploited in the applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 20:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}
