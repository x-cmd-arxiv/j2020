These complexities are exacerbated when we\ntry to adapt existing highly-performant concurrent libraries developed for\nshared-memory environments to this setting. The use of these libraries,\ndeveloped with performance and scalability in mind, is highly desirable. But,\nidentifying a suitable notion of correctness to check their validity under a\nweakly consistent execution model has not been well-studied, in large part\nbecause it is problematic to naively transplant criteria such as\nlinearizability that has a useful interpretation in a shared-memory context to\na distributed one where the cost of imposing a (logical) global ordering on all\nactions is prohibitive.\n  In this paper, we tackle these issues by proposing appropriate semantics and\nspecifications for highly-concurrent libraries in a weakly-consistent,\nreplicated setting.

We detect strong Na ID\nabsorption in the host galaxy, indicating that iPTF16geu belongs to a subclass\nof SNe Ia displaying \"anomalously\" large Na ID column densities in comparison\nto the amount of dust extinction derived from their light curves. For the\ndeflecting galaxy, we refine the measurement of the velocity dispersion,\n$\\sigma = 129 \\pm 4$ km/s, which significantly constrains the lens model.\n  Since the time-delay between the SN images is negligible, we can use\nunresolved ground based spectroscopy, boosted by a factor ~70 from lensing\nmagnification, to study the properties of a high-z SN Ia with unprecedented\nsignal-to-noise ratio. The spectral properties of the supernova, such as\npseudo-Equivalent widths of several absorption features and velocities of the\nSi II-line indicate that iPTF16geu, besides being lensed, is a normal SN Ia,\nindistinguishable from well-studied ones in the local universe, providing\nsupport for the use of SNe Ia in precision cosmology. We do not detect any\nsignificant deviations of the SN spectral energy distribution from microlensing\nof the SN photosphere by stars and compact objects in the lensing galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 17:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

Modeling the transformation towards such an\nenergy system is challenging, because it imposes to consider fluctuations of\nwind and solar and the manifold ways the demand side could adjust to these\nfluctuations.\n  This paper introduces a graph-based method to formulate energy system models\nto address these challenges. By organizing sets in rooted trees, two features\nto facilitate modeling high shares of renewables and sector integration are\nenabled. First, the method allows the level of temporal and spatial detail to\nbe varied by energy carrier. This enables modeling with a high level of detail\nand a large scope, while keeping models computationally tractable. Second, the\ndegree to which energy carriers are substitutable when converted, stored,\ntransported, or consumed can be modeled to achieve a detailed but flexible\nrepresentation of sector integration. An application of the formulation\ndemonstrates that the variation of temporal detail achieves an average\nreduction in computation time of 70\\%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 17:47:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 12:53:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 17:08:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 18:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Despite this potential, most of the robot learning systems today\nare deployed as a fixed policy and they are not being adapted after their\ndeployment. Can we efficiently adapt previously learned behaviors to new\nenvironments, objects and percepts in the real world? In this paper, we present\na method and empirical evidence towards a robot learning framework that\nfacilitates continuous adaption. In particular, we demonstrate how to adapt\nvision-based robotic manipulation policies to new variations by fine-tuning via\noff-policy reinforcement learning, including changes in background, object\nshape and appearance, lighting conditions, and robot morphology. Further, this\nadaptation uses less than 0.2% of the data necessary to learn the task from\nscratch. We find that our approach of adapting pre-trained policies leads to\nsubstantial performance gains over the course of fine-tuning, and that\npre-training via RL is essential: training from scratch or adapting from\nsupervised ImageNet features are both unsuccessful with such small amounts of\ndata. We also find that these positive results hold in a limited continual\nlearning setting, in which we repeatedly fine-tune a single lineage of policies\nusing data from a succession of new tasks. Our empirical conclusions are\nconsistently supported by experiments on simulated manipulation tasks, and by\n52 unique fine-tuning experiments on a real robotic grasping system pre-trained\non 580,000 grasps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 17:57:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 13:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}

A\nunifying property of these systems is strong orbital hybridization, which\ninvolves pairing of states with non-trivial Bloch wave functions. In contrast\nto naive expectation, many of these superconductors are relatively resilient to\ndisorder. Here we study the effects of a generic disorder on superconductivity\nin doped 3D Dirac systems, which serve as a paradigmatic example for the\ndispersion near a band crossing point. We argue that due to strong orbital\nhybridization, interorbital scattering processes are naturally present and must\nbe taken into account. We calculate the reduction of the critical temperature\nfor a variety of pairing states and scattering channels using Abrikosov-Gor'kov\ntheory. In that way, the role of disorder is captured by a single parameter\n$\\Gamma$, the pair scattering rate. This procedure is very general and can be\nreadily applied to different band structures and disorder configurations. Our\nresults show that interorbital scattering has a significant effect on\nsuperconductivity, where the robustness of different pairing states highly\ndepends on the relative strength of the different interorbital scattering\nchannels.

In accordance with the second law of\nthermodynamics, entropy has been increasing ever since the Big Bang. The fact\nthat matter is in thermal equilibrium in the very early Universe, as indicated\nby the cosmic microwave background, has led to the idea that gravitational\nentropy must be very low in the beginning. Penrose proposed that gravitational\nentropy can be quantified by the Weyl curvature, which increases as structures\nformed. A concrete realization of such a measure is the Clifton-Ellis-Tavakol\ngravitational entropy, which has been shown to be increasing in quite a number\nof cosmological models. In this work, we show a counter-example involving a\nclass of inhomogeneous universes that are supported by a chameleon massless\nscalar field and exhibit anisotropic spacetime shearing effects. In fact, in\nour model the Clifton-Ellis-Tavakol gravitational entropy is increasing\nalthough the magnitude of the Weyl curvature is decreasing; this is due to the\ngrowth of the spacetime shear. The topology and the values of the three free\nparameters of the model are constrained by imposing a positive energy density\nfor the cosmic fluid, and the thermodynamical requirements which follow from\nthe cosmological holographic principle and the second law. It is shown that a\nnegative deceleration parameter and a time decreasing Weyl curvature\nautomatically follow from those conditions. Thus, we argue that our model can\naccount for the formation of some primordial structures, like the Large Quasar\nGroups, which has required a non-standard evolution of the spatial\nanisotropies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 18:07:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 12:39:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

In particular, the\nsubadditivity property fails for quadratic Gorenstein ideals.\n  Finally, we show that the idealization of a construction of Roos yields\nnon-Koszul quadratic Gorenstein algebras such that the residue field $k$ has a\nlinear resolution for precisely $\\alpha$ steps for any integer $\\alpha \\ge 2$.\nThus there is no finite test for the Koszul property even for quadratic\nGorenstein algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 18:41:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 17:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

A well-developed task of image description generation is image\ncaptioning, which usually generates a short captioning sentence and thus\nneglects many of fine-grained properties, e.g., the information of subtle\nobjects and their relationships. In this paper, we study the visual paragraph\ngeneration, which can describe the image with a long paragraph containing rich\ndetails. Previous research often generates the paragraph via a hierarchical\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN)-like model, which has complex memorising,\nforgetting and coupling mechanism. Instead, we propose a novel pure CNN model,\nParaCNN, to generate visual paragraph using hierarchical CNN architecture with\ncontextual information between sentences within one paragraph. The ParaCNN can\ngenerate an arbitrary length of a paragraph, which is more applicable in many\nreal-world applications. Furthermore, to enable the ParaCNN to model paragraph\ncomprehensively, we also propose an adversarial twin net training scheme.\nDuring training, we force the forwarding network's hidden features to be close\nto that of the backwards network by using adversarial training. During testing,\nwe only use the forwarding network, which already includes the knowledge of the\nbackwards network, to generate a paragraph. We conduct extensive experiments on\nthe Stanford Visual Paragraph dataset and achieve state-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 19:54:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-23"}

We show how to\nformulate a SIR-type Markov jump process as the solution of a stochastic\ndifferential equation with respect to a Poisson Random Measure (PRM), and how\nto simulate the process trajectory deterministically from a parameter value and\na PRM realisation.\n  This forms the basis of our Data Augmented MCMC, which consists in augmenting\nparameter space with the unobserved PRM value. The resulting simple\nMetropolis-Hastings sampler acts as an efficient simulation-based inference\nmethod, that can easily be transferred from model to model. Compared with a\nrecent Data Augmentation method based on Gibbs sampling of individual infection\nhistories, PRM-augmented MCMC scales much better with epidemic size and is far\nmore flexible.\n  PRM-augmented MCMC also yields a posteriori estimates of the PRM, that\nrepresent process stochasticity, and which can be used to validate the model.\nIf the model is good, the posterior distribution should exhibit no pattern and\nbe close to the PRM prior distribution. We illustrate this by fitting a\nnon-seasonal model to some simulated seasonal case count data. Applied to the\nZika epidemic of 2013 in French Polynesia, our approach shows that a simple\nSEIR model cannot correctly reproduce both the initial sharp increase in the\nnumber of cases as well as the final proportion of seropositive.\n  PRM-augmentation thus provides a coherent story for Stochastic Epidemic Model\ninference, where explicitly inferring process stochasticity helps with model\nvalidation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 19:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-23"}

Classic\nstatistical models, such as smoothing spline ANOVA models, are not well\nequipped to analyze such large samples due to expensive computational costs.

In this article, we develop\nan asympirical, i.e., asymptotic and empirical, smoothing parameters selection\napproach for smoothing spline ANOVA models in large samples. The idea of this\napproach is to use asymptotic analysis to show that the optimal smoothing\nparameter is a polynomial function of the sample size and an unknown constant.\nThe unknown constant is then estimated through empirical subsample\nextrapolation. The proposed method significantly reduces the computational\ncosts of selecting smoothing parameters in high-dimensional and large samples.\nWe show smoothing parameters chosen by the proposed method tend to the optimal\nsmoothing parameters that minimise a specific risk function. In addition, the\nestimator based on the proposed smoothing parameters achieves the optimal\nconvergence rate.

Recently it has been noticed that the\nviral Spike protein has an RGD motif, suggesting that cell surface integrins\nmay be co-receptors. We examined the sequences of ACE2 and integrins with the\nEukaryotic Linear Motif resource, ELM, and were presented with candidate short\nlinear motifs (SLiMs) in their short, unstructured, cytosolic tails with\npotential roles in endocytosis, membrane dynamics, autophagy, cytoskeleton and\ncell signalling. These SLiM candidates are highly conserved in vertebrates.\nThey suggest potential interactions with the AP2 mu2 subunit as well as I-BAR,\nLC3, PDZ, PTB and SH2 domains found in signalling and regulatory proteins\npresent in epithelial lung cells. Several motifs overlap in the tail sequences,\nsuggesting that they may act as molecular switches, often involving tyrosine\nphosphorylation status. Candidate LIR motifs are present in the tails of ACE2\nand integrin beta3, suggesting that these proteins can directly recruit\nautophagy components. We also noticed that the extracellular part of ACE2 has a\nconserved MIDAS structural motif, which are commonly used by beta integrins for\nligand binding, potentially supporting the proposal that integrins and ACE2\nshare common ligands. The findings presented here identify several molecular\nlinks and testable hypotheses that might help uncover the mechanisms of\nSARS-CoV-2 attachment, entry and replication, and strengthen the possibility\nthat it might be possible to develop host-directed therapies to dampen the\nefficiency of viral entry and hamper disease progression. The strong sequence\nconservation means that these putative SLiMs are good candidates: Nevertheless,\nSLiMs must always be validated by experimentation before they can be stated to\nbe functional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 20:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

While classical registration methods\naccurately estimate the spatial correspondence between images, they solve an\noptimization problem for every new image pair. Learning-based techniques are\nfast at test time but limited to registering images with contrasts and\ngeometric content similar to those seen during training. We propose to remove\nthis dependency on training data by leveraging a generative strategy for\ndiverse synthetic label maps and images that exposes networks to a wide range\nof variability, forcing them to learn more invariant features. This approach\nresults in powerful networks that accurately generalize to a broad array of MRI\ncontrasts.

We demonstrate registration accuracy surpassing the state of\nthe art both within and across contrasts, using a single model. Critically,\ntraining on arbitrary shapes synthesized from noise distributions results in\ncompetitive performance, removing the dependency on acquired data of any kind.\nAdditionally, since anatomical label maps are often available for the anatomy\nof interest, we show that synthesizing images from these dramatically boosts\nperformance, while still avoiding the need for real intensity images.

The distortions allow the most important\ncluster parameters to be measured. The spectral shape of the distortions and\nits dependence on the gas temperature, optical depth, and surface density\ndistribution law have been studied using Monte Carlo computations and confirmed\nby analytical estimations. In the cluster frame the maximum of the background\ndecrease due to the recoil effect occurs at ~500-600 keV. The photoionization\nof H- and He-like iron and nickel ions leads to additional distortions in the\nbackground spectrum - a strong absorption line with the threshold at ~9 keV\n(and also to an absorption jump at ~2 keV for cold clusters). The absorption of\nintrinsic thermal radiation from the cluster gas by these ions also leads to\nsuch lines. In nearby (z<1) clusters the line at ~2 keV is noticeably enhanced\nby absorption in the colder (~10^6 K) plasma of their peripheral (~3 Mpc)\nregions; moreover, the absorption line at ~1.3 keV splits off from it. The\nredshift of distant clusters shifts the absorption lines in the background\nspectrum (at ~2, ~9, and ~500 keV) to lower energies. Thus, in contrast to the\nmicrowave background scattering effect, this effect depends on the cluster\nredshift z, but in a very peculiar way. When observing clusters at z>1, the\neffect allows one to determine how the X-ray background evolved and how it was\n\"gathered\" with z. To detect the effect, the accuracy of measurements should\nreach ~0.1%. We consider the most promising clusters for observing the effect\nand discuss the techniques whereby the influence of the thermal gas radiation\nhindering the detection of background distortions should be minimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 20:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-23"}

We\nbase our analysis on a detailed heterogeneous epidemiological model, which\ntakes into account different population groups and phases of the disease,\nincluding incubation, infection period, hospitalization, and treatment in the\nintensive care unit (ICU). We model the healthcare capacity as the total number\nof hospital and ICU beds for the whole country. We calibrate the model\nparameters to data reported in several recent research papers. For high- and\nlow-risk population groups, we calculate the number of total and intensive care\nhospitalizations, and deaths as functions of time. The main conclusion is that\ncountries, which enforce reasonable hygienic measures on time can avoid\nlockdowns throughout the pandemic provided that the number of spare ICU beds\nper million is above the threshold of about 100. In countries where the total\nnumber of ICU beds is below this threshold, a limited period quarantine to\nspecific high-risk groups of the population suffices. Furthermore, in the case\nof an inadequate capacity of the healthcare system, we incorporate a feedback\nloop and demonstrate that quantitative impact of the lack of ICU units on the\ndeath curve. In the case of inadequate ICU beds, full- and partial-quarantine\nscenarios outcomes are almost identical, making it unnecessary to shut down the\nwhole economy.

Methods: A\ndifference-in-differences approach estimated the differential change in\noutcomes for Medicare beneficiaries who had an MJRLE or AMI at a BPCI\nparticipating hospital between the baseline (January 2011 through September\n2013) and intervention (October 2013 through December 2016) periods and\nbeneficiaries with the same episode (MJRLE or AMI) at a matched comparison\nhospital. Main Outcomes and Measures: Medicare payments, LOS, and readmissions\nduring the episode, which includes the anchor hospitalization and the 90-day\npost discharge period. Results: Mean total Medicare payments for an MJRLE\nepisode and the 90-day post discharge period declined $444 more (p < 0.0001)\nfor Medicare beneficiaries with episodes initiated in a BPCI-participating\nprovider than for the beneficiaries in a comparison provider. This reduction\nwas mainly due to reduced institutional post-acute care (PAC) payments. Slight\nreductions in carrier payments and LOS were estimated. Readmission rates were\nnot statistically different between the BPCI and the comparison populations.\nThese findings suggest that PAC use can be reduced without adverse effects on\nrecovery from MJRLE. The lack of statistically significant differences in\neffects for AMI could be explained by a smaller sample size or more\nheterogenous recovery paths in AMI. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that, as\ncurrently designed, bundled payments can be effective in reducing payments for\nMJRLE episodes of care, but not necessarily for AMI. Most savings came from the\ndeclines in PAC. These findings are consistent with the results reported in the\nBPCI model evaluation for CMS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 22:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-23"}

Changes in the\nOCT signal intensity, phase retardation, phase, and frequency spectra were\ncalculated for each subject and reference samples of a mirror and microspheres\nin solution. Results: Observed changes in intensity in 3 paw stimulation and 2\nnerve stimulation subjects and changes in frequency spectra amplitude in 2 paw\nstimulation subjects were above the reference noise level and were temporally\nconsistent with osmotic swelling from ion currents during neural activity.\nConclusion: Light scattering changes produced by osmotic swelling, which have\npreviously been characterised in squid and crab nerve, are also thought to\noccur in myelinated fibres on a scale which is detectable using OCT\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:43:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 14:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

However, there is a scarcity\nof plasma models of lower fidelity than magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), although\nthese reduced models hold promise for understanding key physical mechanisms,\nefficient computation, and real-time optimization and control. Galerkin models,\nobtained by projection of the MHD equations onto a truncated modal basis, and\ndata-driven models, obtained by modern machine learning and system\nidentification, can furnish this gap in the lower levels of the model\nhierarchy. This work develops a reduced-order modeling framework for\ncompressible plasmas, leveraging decades of progress in projection-based and\ndata-driven modeling of fluids. We begin by formalizing projection-based model\nreduction for nonlinear MHD systems. To avoid separate modal decompositions for\nthe magnetic, velocity, and pressure fields, we introduce an energy inner\nproduct to synthesize all of the fields into a dimensionally-consistent,\nreduced-order basis. Next, we obtain an analytic model by Galerkin projection\nof the Hall-MHD equations onto these modes. We illustrate how global\nconservation laws constrain the model parameters, revealing symmetries that can\nbe enforced in data-driven models, directly connecting these models to the\nunderlying physics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on data\nfrom high-fidelity numerical simulations of a 3D spheromak experiment. This\nmanuscript builds a bridge to the extensive Galerkin literature in fluid\nmechanics, and facilitates future principled development of projection-based\nand data-driven models for plasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 04:04:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 18:23:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 02:53:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 14:46:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

Oftentimes, stakes are much higher when\nthese potential anomalies are intentional or goal-oriented. We propose an\nend-to-end framework for sequential anomaly detection using inverse\nreinforcement learning (IRL), whose objective is to determine the\ndecision-making agent's underlying function which triggers his/her behavior.\nThe proposed method takes the sequence of actions of a target agent (and\npossibly other meta information) as input. The agent's normal behavior is then\nunderstood by the reward function which is inferred via IRL. We use a neural\nnetwork to represent a reward function. Using a learned reward function, we\nevaluate whether a new observation from the target agent follows a normal\npattern.

It is produced in the mesophyll cells\nof leaves and translocated to different parts of the plant through the phloem.\nProgress in understanding this transport mechanism remains fraught with\nexperimental difficulties thereby prompting interest in theoretical approaches\nand laboratory studies. The Munch pressure and mass flow model is one of the\ncommonly accepted hypotheses for describing the physics of sucrose transport in\nthe phloem systems. It is based on osmosis to build an energy potential\ndifference between the source and the sink. The flow responding to this energy\npotential is assumed laminar and described by the Hagen-Poiseulle equation.\nThis study revisits such osmotically driven flow in tubes by including the\neffects of Taylor dispersion on mass transport, which has not been considered\nin the context of phloem flow. Taylor dispersion is an effect in tube flow\nwhere shear flow can increase the effective transport of species. It is shown\nthat in addition to the conventional Taylor dispersion diffusive correction\nderived for closed pipe walls, a new adjustments to the mean advective terms,\narise because of osmotic effects. These new terms act as local sources and\nsinks of sucrose, though their overall average effect is zero. Because the\nmolecular Schmidt number is very large for sucrose in water, the role of a\nradial Peclet number emerges as controlling the sucrose front speed and travel\ntimes above and beyond the much studied Munch number.

From XRR measurements, we find that the deposition rate and the\ndensity of Ni-N films decrease due to successively progression in RN2,\nsignifying that Ni-N alloys and compounds are forming both at Ni target surface\nand also within the thin film samples. The crystal structure obtained from XRD\nmeasurements suggest an evolution of different Ni-N compounds given by: Ni,\nNi(N), Ni4N, Ni3N, and Ni2N with a gradual rise in RN2. XANES measurements\nfurther confirm these phases, in agreement with XRD results. Polarized neutron\nreflectivity measurements were performed to probe the magnetization, and it was\nfound Ni-N thin films become non-magnetic even when N incorporation increases\nbeyond few at%. Overall growth behavior of Ni-N samples has been compared with\nthat of rather well-known Fe-N and Co-N systems, yielding similarities and\ndifferences among them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 06:12:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-23"}

Our observations show that SN2020bvc shares several properties\nin common with the Ic-BL SN2006aj, which was associated with the low-luminosity\ngamma-ray burst (LLGRB) 060218. First, the 10 GHz radio light curve is on the\nfaint end of LLGRB-SNe ($L_\\mathrm{radio} \\approx 10^{37}$erg/s): we model our\nVLA observations (spanning 13-43 d) as synchrotron emission from a mildly\nrelativistic ($v \\gtrsim 0.3c$) forward shock. Second, with Swift and Chandra\nwe detect X-ray emission ($L_X \\approx 10^{41}$erg/s) that is not naturally\nexplained as inverse Compton emission or as part of the same synchrotron\nspectrum as the radio emission. Third, high-cadence ($6\\times$/night) data from\nthe Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) shows a double-peaked optical light curve,\nthe first peak from shock-cooling emission from extended low-mass material\n(mass $M<10^{-2} M_\\odot$ at radius $R>10^{12}$cm) and the second peak from the\nradioactive decay of Ni-56. SN2020bvc is the first confirmed double-peaked\nIc-BL SN discovered without a GRB trigger, and shows X-ray and radio emission\nsimilar to LLGRB-SNe: this is consistent with models in which the same\nmechanism produces both the LLGRB and the shock-cooling emission. For four of\nthe five other nearby ($z\\lesssim0.05$) Ic-BL SNe with ZTF high-cadence data,\nwe rule out a first peak like that seen in SN2006aj and SN2020bvc, i.e. that\nlasts $\\approx 1$d and reaches a peak luminosity $M \\approx -18$. X-ray and\nradio follow-up observations of future such events will establish whether\ndouble-peaked optical light curves are indeed predictive of LLGRB-like X-ray\nand radio emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 06:15:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 01:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

Negligible surface dispersion with lower\nknee-walkout at high V$_\\mathrm{DS}$, and better breakdown characteristics\ncompared to their unpassivated counterparts were achieved. A three terminal\noff-state breakdown voltage of 315 V, corresponding to an average breakdown\nfield of 2.3 MV/cm was measured.

Current deep\nlearning models that are trained with real-world images have excellent noise\nreduction, but a ratio parameter must be chosen manually to complete the\nenhancement pipeline. In this work, we propose an adaptive low-light raw image\nenhancement network to avoid parameter-handcrafting and to improve image\nquality. The proposed method can be divided into two sub-models: Brightness\nPrediction (BP) and Exposure Shifting (ES). The former is designed to control\nthe brightness of the resulting image by estimating a guideline exposure time\n$t_1$. The latter learns to approximate an exposure-shifting operator $ES$,\nconverting a low-light image with real exposure time $t_0$ to a noise-free\nimage with guideline exposure time $t_1$. Additionally, structural similarity\n(SSIM) loss and Image Enhancement Vector (IEV) are introduced to promote image\nquality, and a new Campus Image Dataset (CID) is proposed to overcome the\nlimitations of the existing datasets and to supervise the training of the\nproposed model. Using the proposed model, we can achieve high-quality low-light\nimage enhancement from a single raw image. In quantitative tests, it is shown\nthat the proposed method has the lowest Noise Level Estimation (NLE) score\ncompared with the state-of-the-art low-light algorithms, suggesting a superior\ndenoising performance. Furthermore, those tests illustrate that the proposed\nmethod is able to adaptively control the global image brightness according to\nthe content of the image scene.

NuSTAR caught several X-ray flares, spanning a dynamic range of 100,\nand detected X-ray pulsations at 187.0 s, consistent with previous\nmeasurements. The spectrum from the whole observation is well described by an\nabsorbed power-law (with a photon index of 1.4) modified, above 7 keV, by a\ncutoff with an e-folding energy of 24 keV. A weak emission line is present at\n6.4 keV, consistent with Kalpha emission from cold iron in the supergiant wind.\nThe time-averaged flux is 1.5E-10 erg/cm2/s (3-78 keV, corrected for the\nabsorption), translating into an average luminosity of about 9E35 erg/s (1-100\nkeV, assuming a distance of 6.5 kpc). The NuSTAR observation allowed us to\nperform the most sensitive search for cyclotron resonant scattering features in\nthe hard X-ray spectrum, resulting in no significant detection in any of the\ndifferent spectral extractions adopted (time-averaged, temporally-selected,\nspin-phase-resolved and intensity-selected spectra). The pulse profile showed\nan evolution with both the energy (3-12 keV energy range compared with 12-78\nkeV band) and the X-ray flux: a double peaked profile was evident at higher\nfluxes (and in both energy bands), while a single peaked, sinusoidal profile\nwas present at the lowest intensity state achieved within the NuSTAR\nobservations (in both energy bands). The intensity-selected analysis allowed us\nto observe an anti-correlation of the pulsed fraction with the X-ray\nluminosity.

To address the\nproblem of transient landslide tsunami runup and to predict the resulting\ninundation, we utilize a nonlinear model equation in the Lagrangian frame of\nreference. The motivation for using such a scheme lies in the fact that the\nrunup on an inclined boundary is directly and readily computed in the\nLagrangian framework without the need to resort to approximations. In this\nwork, we investigate the inundation patterns due to landslide tsunamis in a\nlake. We show by numerical computations that Airy's approximation of an\nirrotational theory using Lagrangian coordinates can legitimately predict runup\nof large amplitude.

Subspace clustering has been proven to be powerful for\nexploiting the intrinsic relationship between data points. Despite the\nimpressive performance in the HSI clustering, traditional subspace clustering\nmethods often ignore the inherent structural information among data. In this\npaper, we revisit the subspace clustering with graph convolution and present a\nnovel subspace clustering framework called Graph Convolutional Subspace\nClustering (GCSC) for robust HSI clustering. Specifically, the framework\nrecasts the self-expressiveness property of the data into the non-Euclidean\ndomain, which results in a more robust graph embedding dictionary. We show that\ntraditional subspace clustering models are the special forms of our framework\nwith the Euclidean data. Basing on the framework, we further propose two novel\nsubspace clustering models by using the Frobenius norm, namely Efficient GCSC\n(EGCSC) and Efficient Kernel GCSC (EKGCSC). Both models have a globally optimal\nclosed-form solution, which makes them easier to implement, train, and apply in\npractice. Extensive experiments on three popular HSI datasets demonstrate that\nEGCSC and EKGCSC can achieve state-of-the-art clustering performance and\ndramatically outperforms many existing methods with significant margins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 10:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

Current approaches of dealing with GANs' issues almost utilize\nsome practical training techniques for the purpose of regularization, which on\nthe other hand undermines the convergence and theoretical soundness of GAN. In\nthis paper, we propose to stabilize GAN training via a novel particle-based\nvariational inference -- Langevin Stein variational gradient descent (LSVGD),\nwhich not only inherits the flexibility and efficiency of original SVGD but\naims to address its instability issues by incorporating an extra disturbance\ninto the update dynamics. We further demonstrate that by properly adjusting the\nnoise variance, LSVGD simulates a Langevin process whose stationary\ndistribution is exactly the target distribution. We also show that LSVGD\ndynamics has an implicit regularization which is able to enhance particles'\nspread-out and diversity. At last we present an efficient way of applying\nparticle-based variational inference on a general GAN training procedure no\nmatter what loss function is adopted.

The latter is known to host sub-10 nm skyrmions which are\nof great interest in information technology. The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\nequation is parametrized with magnetic exchange interactions extracted from\nfirst-principles. Depending on the nature of the defect and the magnitude of\nthe applied magnetic field, the skyrmion deforms by either shrinking or\nincreasing in size, experiencing thereby elliptical distortions. After applying\na magnetic field of 10 Tesla, ultrasmall skyrmions are driven along a straight\nline towards the various defects which permits a simple analysis of the impact\nof the impurities. Independently from the nature of the skyrmion-defect complex\ninteraction a gyrotropic motion is observed. A repulsive force leads to a\nskyrmion trajectory similar to the one induced by an attractive one. We unveil\nthat the circular motion is clockwise around pinning impurities but counter\nclockwise around the repulsive ones, which can be used to identify the\ninteraction nature of the defects by observing the skyrmions trajectories.\nMoreover, and as expected, the skyrmion always escapes the repulsive defects in\ncontrast to the pinning defects, which require a minimal depinning current to\nobserve impurity avoidance. This unveils the richness of the motion regimes of\nskyrmions. We discuss the results of the simulations in terms of the Thiele\nequation, which provides a reasonable qualitative description of the observed\nphenomena. Finally, we show an example of a double track made of pinning\nimpurities, where the engineering of their mutual distance allows to control\nthe skyrmion motion with enhanced velocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 11:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-23"}

It is the\nphenomenon where a certain price-series lags behind and partially replicates\nthe movement of leading time-series. The present research proposes a new\ntechnique which helps better identify the lead-lag relationship empirically.\nApart from better identifying the lead-lag path, the technique also gives a\nmeasure for adjudging closeness between financial time-series. Also, the\nproposed measure is closely related to correlation, and it uses Dynamic\nProgramming technique for finding the optimal lead-lag path. Further, it\nretains most of the properties of a metric, so much so, it is termed as loose\nmetric. Tests are performed on Synthetic Time Series (STS) with known lead-lag\nrelationship and comparisons are done with other state-of-the-art models on the\nbasis of significance and forecastability. The proposed technique gives the\nbest results in both the tests. It finds paths which are all statistically\nsignificant, and its forecasts are closest to the target values. Then, we use\nthe measure to study the topology evolution of the Foreign Exchange market, as\nthe COVID-19 pandemic unfolds. Here, we study the FX currency prices of 29\nprominent countries of the world. It is observed that as the crises unfold, all\nthe currencies become strongly interlinked to each other. Also, USA Dollar\nstarts playing even more central role in the FX market. Finally, we mention\nseveral other application areas of the proposed technique for designing\nintelligent systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 13:24:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 May 2020 17:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

The\nability to control vortex shedding is critical to improve the aerodynamic\nperformance of these unsteady fluid flow systems. This goal requires precise\ncharacterization of how perturbations affect the long-time phase of the\noscillatory flow, as well as the ability to control transient behaviors. In\nthis work, we develop an energy-efficient flow control strategy to rapidly\nalter the oscillation phase of time-periodic fluid flows, leveraging theory\ndeveloped for periodic biological systems. First, we perform a\nphase-sensitivity analysis to construct a reduced-order model for the response\nof the flow oscillation to impulsive control inputs at various phases. Next, we\nintroduce two control strategies for real-time phase control based on the\nphase-sensitivity function: 1) optimal phase control, obtained by solving the\nEuler-Lagrange equations as a two-point boundary value problem, and 2)\nmodel-predictive control (MPC). Our approach is demonstrated for two unsteady\nflow systems, the incompressible laminar flow past a circular cylinder and the\nflow past an airfoil. We show that effective phase control may be achieved with\nseveral actuation strategies, including blowing and rotary control. Moreover,\nour control approach uses realistic measurements of the lift force on the body,\nrather than requiring high-dimensional measurements of the full flow field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 13:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

Related work\nthus responds to major societal demand. This study is of water-gas shift on\nplatinum for hydrogen production.

This is also true for\nreactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting\nbut facilitated in comparison to gas phase reaction channels. Since\nbond-breaking is poorly described by Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, this work\nadopts Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology. QMC is a stochastic approach to\nsolving the Schr\\\"odinger equation recently came of age for heterogeneous\nsystems involving solids.\n  The present work considers co-adsorption of water and carbon monoxide on\nPt(111). The water is partially dissociated while its oxygen atom binds to CO\nlosing a hydrogen atom. This concerted step is rate-limiting. The resulting\nadsorbed formate species then decomposes to readily eliminated carbon dioxide\nand the clean-fuel product is H$_2$.\n  The Transition-State geometry can be optimized using molecular Quantum Monte\nCarlo force constants, on the basis of our earlier work using the CASINO\nsoftware.\n  Our embedded active site approach is used. This allows a high-level\nconfiguration interaction (CI) wave-function to be used, expanded in\nplane-waves and embedded in the metal lattice exposing its close-packed face.\nThe resulting periodic function is used to guide the Quantum Monte Carlo\ncalculation.\n  Results are given here on mechanism and QMC activation barrier for water\naddition to CO pre-adsorbed on Pt(111) of 17 +/- 0.2 c.f. apparent measured\nvalue of 17.05 kcal/mol.

By reformulating\nthe original boundary value problem over a surrogate (approximate)\ncomputational domain, the SBM avoids integration over cut cells and the\nassociated problematic issues regarding numerical stability and matrix\nconditioning. Accuracy is maintained by modifying the original boundary\nconditions using Taylor expansions. Hence the name of the method, that {\\it\nshifts} the location and values of the boundary conditions. In this article, we\npresent enhanced variational SBM formulations for the Poisson and Stokes\nproblems with improved flexibility and robustness. These simplified variational\nforms allow to relax some of the assumptions required by the mathematical\nproofs of stability and convergence of earlier implementations. First, we show\nthat these new SBM implementations can be proved asymptotically stable and\nconvergent even without the rather restrictive assumption that the inner\nproduct between the normals to the true and surrogate boundaries is positive.\nSecond, we show that it is not necessary to introduce a stabilization term\ninvolving the tangential derivatives of the solution at Dirichlet boundaries,\ntherefore avoiding the calibration of an additional stabilization parameter.\nFinally, we prove enhanced $L^{2}$-estimates without the cumbersome assumption\n- of earlier proofs - that the surrogate domain is convex. Instead we rely on a\nconventional assumption that the boundary of the true domain is smooth, which\ncan also be replaced by requiring convexity of the true domain. The\naforementioned improvements open the way to a more general and efficient\nimplementation of the Shifted Boundary Method, particularly in complex\nthree-dimensional geometries. We present numerical experiments in two and three\ndimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 14:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-23"}

Due to the necessity of using large antenna arrays to\nobtain the beamforming gain required to compensate for small antenna aperture,\nsynchronization must be performed either jointly with beam training as in 5G\nNR, or at the low SNR regime if the high-dimensional mmWave MIMO channel is to\nbe estimated. To circumvent this problem, this work proposes the first\nsynchronization framework for mmWave MIMO that is robust to both TO, CFO, and\nPN synchronization errors and, unlike prior work, implicitly considers the use\nof multiple RF chains at both transmitter and receiver. I provide a theoretical\nanalysis of the estimation problem and derive the HCRLB for the estimation of\nboth the CFO, PN, and equivalent beamformed channels seen by the different\nreceive RF chains. I also propose two novel algorithms to estimate the\ndifferent unknown parameters, which rely on approximating the MMSE estimator\nfor the PN and the ML estimators for both the CFO and the equivalent beamformed\nchannels. Thereafter, I propose to use the estimates for the equivalent\nbeamformed channels to perform compressive estimation of the high-dimensional\nfrequency-selective mmWave MIMO channel and thus undergo data transmission. For\nperformance evaluation, I consider the QuaDRiGa channel simulator, which\nimplements the 5G NR channel model, and show that both compressive channel\nestimation without prior synchronization is possible, and the proposed\napproaches outperform current solutions for joint beam training and\nsynchronization currently considered in 5G NR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 14:37:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 May 2020 15:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

This variability is seen as\noscillations, granulation, supergranulation, and meridional flows. The effect\nof this latter process is poorly known but could affect exoplanet\ndetectability. We aim to quantify its amplitude when integrated over the disc\nand its temporal variability, first for the Sun, seen with different\ninclinations, and then for other solar-type stars. We used long time series of\nsolar latitudinal meridional circulation to reconstruct its integrated\ncontribution. We then used scaling laws from HD simulations relating the\namplitude of the meridional flow variability with stellar mass and rotation\nrate to estimate the typical amplitude expected for other solar-type stars. We\nfind typical rms of the order of 0.5-0.7 m/s (edge-on) and 1.2-1.7 m/s\n(pole-on) for the Sun, with a minimal jitter for an inclination of 45-55 deg.\nThis is significant compared to other stellar activity contributions and is\nmuch larger than the radial-velocity signal of the Earth. The variability is\nstrongly related to the activity cycle. Extension to other solar-type stars\nshows that the variability due to meridional flows is dominated by the\namplitude of the cycle of those stars. The meridional flow contribution\nsometimes represents a high fraction of the convective blueshift inhibition\nsignal, especially for quiet, low-mass stars. Our study shows that these\nmeridional flows could be critical for exoplanet detection. Low inclinations\nare more impacted than edge-on configurations, but these latter still exhibit\nsignificant variability. Meridional flows also degrade the correlation between\nradial velocities due to convective blueshift inhibition and chromospheric\nactivity indicators. This will make the correction from this signal challenging\nfor stars with no multi-cellular patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 14:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

Orientation-averaged terms of the KHMH are\ncomputed on the plane of the mean flow and on the geometric centreline. We\nconsider locations between $2$ and $8$ times the width $d$ of the prism. The\nmean flow produces kinetic energy which feeds the vortex shedding coherent\nstructures. In turn, these structures transfer energy to the stochastic\nfluctuations over all length-scales $r$ from the Taylor length $\\lambda$ to $d$\nand dominate spatial turbulent transport of two-point stochastic turbulent\nfluctuations. The orientation-averaged non-linear inter-scale transfer rate\n$\\Pi^{a}$ which was found to be approximately independent of $r$ by Alves\nPortela et. al.

However, the\nnear-constancy of $\\Pi^a$ at $x_1=8d$ which was also found by Alves Portela et.\nal. (2017) is mostly due to stochastic fluctuations.

Inspired by how experienced manga artists draw\nmanga, MangaGAN generates the geometric features of manga face by a designed\nGAN model and delicately translates each facial region into the manga domain by\na tailored multi-GANs architecture. For training MangaGAN, we construct a new\ndataset collected from a popular manga work, containing manga facial features,\nlandmarks, bodies, and so on. Moreover, to produce high-quality manga faces, we\nfurther propose a structural smoothing loss to smooth stroke-lines and avoid\nnoisy pixels, and a similarity preserving module to improve the similarity\nbetween domains of photo and manga. Extensive experiments show that MangaGAN\ncan produce high-quality manga faces which preserve both the facial similarity\nand a popular manga style, and outperforms other related state-of-the-art\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 15:23:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 17:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

In many real-world scenarios, the examined events can be directly\nlinked to the actions of an adversary, such as attacks on computer networks or\nfrauds in financial operations. While the defender wants to discover such\nmalicious behavior, the attacker seeks to accomplish their goal (e.g.,\nexfiltrating data) while avoiding the detection. To this end, anomaly detectors\nhave been used in a game-theoretic framework that captures these goals of a\ntwo-player competition. We extend the existing models to more realistic\nsettings by (1) allowing both players to have continuous action spaces and by\nassuming that (2) the defender cannot perfectly observe the action of the\nattacker.

With the advent of Internet-of-Things and the necessity to enable\nintelligence in embedded devices, low-power and secure hardware implementation\nof DNNs is vital. In this paper, we investigate the use of quantization to\npotentially resist adversarial attacks. Several recent studies have reported\nremarkable results in reducing the energy requirement of a DNN through\nquantization. However, no prior work has considered the relationship between\nadversarial sensitivity of a DNN and its effect on quantization. We propose\nQUANOS- a framework that performs layer-specific hybrid quantization based on\nAdversarial Noise Sensitivity (ANS). We identify a novel noise stability metric\n(ANS) for DNNs, i.e., the sensitivity of each layer's computation to\nadversarial noise. ANS allows for a principled way of determining optimal\nbit-width per layer that incurs adversarial robustness as well as\nenergy-efficiency with minimal loss in accuracy. Essentially, QUANOS assigns\nlayer significance based on its contribution to adversarial perturbation and\naccordingly scales the precision of the layers. A key advantage of QUANOS is\nthat it does not rely on a pre-trained model and can be applied in the initial\nstages of training. We evaluate the benefits of QUANOS on precision scalable\nMultiply and Accumulate (MAC) hardware architectures with data gating and\nsubword parallelism capabilities.

Mediation analyses were also stratified\nby maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index.Results Low maternal educational\nattainment was associated with an increased odd of tobacco smoking during\npregnancy (adjusted OR (ORa)=2.58 [95% CI 2.34, 2.84]) as well as a decrease in\nchild birthweight for GA (RRa=0.94 [95% 0.91, 0.98]). Tobacco smoking during\npregnancy was associated with a decrease in offspring birthweight for GA\n(RRa=0.73 [95% CI 0.70, 0.76]). Mediation analysis suggests that 39% of the\neffect of low maternal educational attainment on offspring birthweight for GA\nwas mediated by smoking during pregnancy. A more important direct effect of\nmaternal educational attainment on child birthweight for GA was observed among\nunderweight women (RRa=0.82 [95%CI 0.72, 0.93]).Conclusions The relationship\nbetween maternal educational attainment and child birthweight for GA is\nstrongly mediated by smoking during pregnancy. Reducing maternal smoking could\nlessen the occurrence of infant SGA and decrease socioeconomic inequalities in\nbirthweight for GA.Keywords Birthweight, educational attainment, tobacco\nsmoking, pregnancy, mediation analysis, health inequalities\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 09:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-24"}

In this paper, we provide a systematic\nreview of GLRS, on how they obtain the knowledge from graphs to improve the\naccuracy, reliability and explainability for recommendations. First, we\ncharacterize and formalize GLRS, and then summarize and categorize the key\nchallenges in this new research area. Then, we survey the most recent and\nimportant developments in the area. Finally, we share some new research\ndirections in this vibrant area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 15:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-27"}

Recent works show that low rank tensor ring\napproximation is one of the most powerful tools to solve tensor completion\nproblem. However, existing algorithms need predefined tensor ring rank which\nmay be hard to determine in practice. To address the issue, we propose a\nhierarchical tensor ring decomposition for more compact representation. We use\nthe standard tensor ring to decompose a tensor into several 3-order sub-tensors\nin the first layer, and each sub-tensor is further factorized by tensor\nsingular value decomposition (t-SVD) in the second layer. In the low rank\ntensor completion based on the proposed decomposition, the zero elements in the\n3-order core tensor are pruned in the second layer, which helps to\nautomatically determinate the tensor ring rank. To further enhance the recovery\nperformance, we use total variation to exploit the locally piece-wise\nsmoothness data structure. The alternating direction method of multiplier can\ndivide the optimization model into several subproblems, and each one can be\nsolved efficiently. Numerical experiments on color images and hyperspectral\nimages demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-arts\nones in terms of recovery accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 11:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-03"}

The current methods, however, do not investigate the relationships\namong multiple passages in the answer generation process, even though topics\ncorrelated among the passages may be answer candidates. Our method, called\nneural answer Generation through Unified Memories over Multiple Passages\n(GUM-MP), solves this problem as follows. First, it determines which tokens in\nthe passages are matched to the question. In particular, it investigates\nmatches between tokens in positive passages, which are assigned to the\nquestion, and those in negative passages, which are not related to the\nquestion. Next, it determines which tokens in the passage are matched to other\npassages assigned to the same question and at the same time it investigates the\ntopics in which they are matched. Finally, it encodes the token sequences with\nthe above two matching results into unified memories in the passage encoders\nand learns the answer sequence by using an encoder-decoder with a\nmultiple-pointer-generator mechanism. As a result, GUM-MP can generate answers\nby pointing to important tokens present across passages. Evaluations indicate\nthat GUM-MP generates much more accurate results than the current models do.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 11:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-30"}

Automated detection of lung\ninfections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to\naugment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However,\nsegmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including\nhigh variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between\ninfections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is\nimpractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep\nmodel. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection\nSegmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify\ninfected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial\ndecoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map.\nThen, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized\nto model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate\nthe shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation\nframework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only\nrequires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our\nsemi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher\nperformance.
