For high-order models, the solution of this problem\nrequires a non-trivial effort. The paper outlines the functioning of a publicly\navailable Python script which has been written to assist researchers in that\ntask. The speed of sound $c_s$ is considered as a parameter, which can, within\nlimits, be chosen at will. Under this premise, the Maxwell-Boltzmann constraint\nequations are a system of linear equations to determine the weights, and hence\namenable to numerical solution by standard linear algebra library routines. By\nsuitable contractions, the tensor equations are mapped to a set of equivalent\nscalar equations, which simplifies the treatment significantly. For a\nuser-supplied set of velocity shells, the software first checks if a solution\nfor the weights exists, and returns it if it also happens to be unique. In such\na case, the software also calculates the range of $c_s$ values that yield\npositive weights. Standard models like D3Q19 with a well-defined special $c_s$\nvalue then result as limiting cases where one of the weights vanishes. In case\nof an infinite set of solutions, the user may find one particular solution by\nsupplying a $c_s$ value, and then minimizing one or several weights within the\nframework of standard linear programming. Some examples illustrate the\nfeasibility and usefulness of the approach.

However, here we show that falsification is especially\nproblematic for theories of consciousness. We formally describe the standard\nexperimental setup for testing these theories.

If there is a mismatch between inference and prediction, a theory is\nfalsified. We show that if inference and prediction are independent, it follows\nthat any minimally informative theory of consciousness is automatically\nfalsified. This is deeply problematic since the field's reliance on report or\nbehavior to infer conscious experiences implies such independence, so this\nfragility affects many contemporary theories of consciousness. Furthermore, we\nshow that if inference and prediction are strictly dependent, it follows that a\ntheory is unfalsifiable. This affects theories which claim consciousness to be\ndetermined by report or behavior.

The transition between synchrotron-dominated and\ninverse-Compton-dominated emissions takes place at $\\approx 10^9$ eV. Aims: The\nshort-term (weeks to months) flux variability of the synchrotron emission from\nthe most energetic electrons is investigated with data from ten years of\nobservations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) in the energy range from\n60 MeV to 600 MeV. Methods: The off-pulse light-curve has been reconstructed\nfrom phase-resolved data. The corresponding histogram of flux measurements is\nused to identify distributions of flux-states and the statistical significance\nof a lower-flux component is estimated with dedicated simulations of mock\nlight-curves. The energy spectra for different flux states are reconstructed.\nResults: We confirm the presence of flaring-states which follow a log-normal\nflux distribution. Additionally, we discover a low-flux state where the flux\ndrops to as low as 18.4% of the intermediate-state average flux and stays there\nfor several weeks. The transition time is observed to be as short as 2 days.\nThe energy spectrum during the low-flux state resembles the extrapolation of\nthe inverse-Compton spectrum measured at energies beyond several GeV energy,\nimplying that the high-energy part of the synchrotron emission is dramatically\ndepressed. Conclusions: The low-flux state found here and the transition time\nof at most 10 days indicate that the bulk ($>75$%) of the synchrotron emission\nabove $10^8$ eV originates in a compact volume with apparent angular size of\n$\\theta\\approx0.4\" t_\\mathrm{var}/(5 \\mathrm{d})$.

The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31)\napproximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3\ninitially, 1.36 at day 22 and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of\nlockdown. The predicted death toll is approximately 15600 casualties, with 2.7\nmillion infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period\nproviding a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infection\nperiod is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the\nreported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is\n0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed.\nHowever, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals.

Simplifying approximations for this SN rate are ubiquitous in simulation\nstudies. We show here how the choice of SN budget and timings ($t_0$ for the\ndelay between star formation and the first SN, $\\tau_{\\rm SN}$ for the duration\nof SN injection, and the minimum SN progenitor mass) drive changes in the\nregulation of star formation and outflow launching. Extremely long delays for\ninstantaneous injection of SN energy $(t_0 << 20\\;\\rm{Myr})$ reduces star\nformation and drive stronger outflows compared smaller delays. This effect is\nprimarily driven by enhanced clustering of young stars. With continuous\ninjection of energy, longer SN durations results in a larger fraction of SN\nenergy deposited in low ambient gas densities, where cooling losses are lower.\nThis is effect is particularly when driven by the choice of the minimum SN\nprogenitor mass, which also sets the total SN energy budget. These underlying\nuncertainties mean that despite advances in the sub-grid modeling of SN\nfeedback, serious difficulties in constraining the strength of SN feedback\nremain.

Models of the SN ejecta\ncolliding with CSM are necessary to infer the structure of the CSM and tie it\nback to a progenitor model. Recent SNe I revealed CSM concentrated at a\ndistance $r\\sim10^16$ cm, for which models of SN interaction are extremely\nlimited. In this paper, we assume the concentrated region is a \"wall\"\nrepresenting swept-up material, and unswept material lies outside the wall. We\nsimulate one-dimensional hydrodynamics of SNe Ia & Ib impacting 300 unique CSM\nconfigurations using RT1D, which captures the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. We\nfind that the density ratio between the wall and ejecta -- denoted $A_0$ or\n\"wall height\" -- is key, and higher walls deviate more from self-similar\nevolution. Functional fits accounting for $A_0$ are presented for the forward\nshock radius evolution. We show that higher walls have more degeneracy between\nCSM properties in the deceleration parameter, slower shocks, deeper-probing\nreverse shocks, slower shocked ejecta, less ejecta mass than CSM in the shock,\nand more mixing of ejecta into the CSM at early times. We analyze observations\nof SN 2014C (Type Ib) and suggest that it had a moderately high wall ($10 < A_0\n< 200$) and wind-like outer CSM. We also postulate an alternate interpretation\nfor the radio data of SN 2014C, that the radio rise occurs in the wind rather\nthan the wall. Finally, we find that hydrodynamic measurements at very late\ntimes cannot distinguish the presence of a wall, except perhaps as an\nanomalously wide shock region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

Consequently,\nthermal re-emission by dust at FIR wavelengths is often linked to the\nstar-formation activity of a galaxy. However, several studies argue that the\ncontribution to dust heating by much older stars might be more significant.\nAdvances in radiation transfer (RT) simulations finally allow us to actually\nquantify the heating mechanisms of diffuse dust by the stellar radiation field.\n  Aims: As one of the main goals in the DustPedia project, we have constructed\ndetailed 3D stellar and dust RT models for nearby galaxies.

We report a\nclear effect of the bar structure on the radial profiles of the dust-heating\nfraction by the young stars, and the dust temperature.

This dust-heating\nfraction drops to ~53% in the bar region and ~38% in the bulge region where the\nold stars are the dominant contributors to the dust heating.

Citation and authorship links contain major\ncomplementary information to the textual content of the publications. In this\npaper, we propose a benchmark for expert finding in document networks by\nleveraging data extracted from a scientific citation network and three\nscientific question & answer websites. We compare the performances of several\nalgorithms on these different sources of data and further study the\napplicability of embedding methods on an expert finding task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 18:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-09"}

However, the time required to evaluate even simple\nspatial queries over large data sets greatly hampers our ability to\ninteractively explore these data sets and extract actionable insights. Graphics\nProcessing Units~(GPUs) are increasingly being used to speedup spatial queries.\nHowever, existing GPU-based solutions have two important drawbacks: they are\noften tightly coupled to the specific query types they target, making it hard\nto adapt them for other queries; and since their design is based on CPU-based\napproaches, it can be difficult to effectively utilize all the benefits\nprovided by the GPU.

We apply this index to the case of oxygen gas, O2, on\nEarth-like planets with varying water contents. We demonstrate that on\nEarth-like exoplanets with 0.2 weight percent (wt%) water (i.e., no exposed\ncontinents) a reduced flux of bioessential phosphorus limits the export of\nphotosynthetically produced atmospheric O2 to levels indistinguishable from\ngeophysical production by photolysis of water plus hydrogen escape.

Paradoxically, the maximum water content allowing use of O2\nas a biosignature, 0.2wt%, is consistent with no water based on mass and\nradius.

The OBProx-SG method contains two\nsteps: (i) a proximal stochastic gradient step to predict a support cover of\nthe solution; and (ii) an orthant step to aggressively enhance the sparsity\nlevel via orthant face projection. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods,\ne.g., Prox-SG, RDA and Prox-SVRG, the OBProx-SG not only converges to the\nglobal optimal solutions (in convex scenario) or the stationary points (in\nnon-convex scenario), but also promotes the sparsity of the solutions\nsubstantially. Particularly, on a large number of convex problems, OBProx-SG\noutperforms the existing methods comprehensively in the aspect of sparsity\nexploration and objective values. Moreover, the experiments on non-convex deep\nneural networks, e.g., MobileNetV1 and ResNet18, further demonstrate its\nsuperiority by achieving the solutions of much higher sparsity without\nsacrificing generalization accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 18:23:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 04:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-24"}

However, experimental results have been limited\nuntil now because injecting electrons into the laser field has remained a\nconsiderable challenge. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that using a plasma\nmirror as an injector solves this problem and permits to inject electrons at\nthe ideal phase of the laser, resulting in the acceleration of electrons along\nthe laser propagation direction while reducing the electron beam divergence\ncompared to the linear polarization case.

By limiting the subject to these methods, we are able\nto identify principles underlying coding for control; a subject of significant\nrecent interest but few tangible results. In particular, we consider coding the\nquantized output signal deploying period-two codes of differing\ndelay-versus-accuracy tradeoff. The quantification of coding performance is via\nthe LQ control cost. The feedback control system comprises the coder-decoder in\nthe path between the output and the state estimator, which is followed by\nlinear state-variable feedback, as is optimal in the memoryless case. The\nquantizer is treated as the functional composition of an infinitely-long linear\nstaircase function and a saturation. This permits the analysis to subdivide\ninto estimator computations, seemingly independent of the control performance\ncriterion, and an escape time evaluation, which ties the control back into the\nchoice of quantizer saturation bound. An example is studied which illustrates\nthe role of the control objective in determining the efficacy of coding using\nthese schemes.

Yet, planning for\nevery contingency can lead to over-conservative, poorly performing solutions or\neven, in extreme cases, to infeasibility. Resilience addresses these\nshortcomings by adapting the underlying control problem, e.g., by relaxing its\nspecifications, to obtain a feasible, possibly still valuable trajectory.\nDespite their different aspects, robustness and resilience are often conflated\nin the context of dynamical systems and control. The goal of this paper is to\nformalize, in the context of optimal control, the concept of resilience\nunderstood as above, i.e., in terms of adaptation. To do so, we introduce a\nresilient formulation of optimal control by allowing disruption-dependent\nmodifications of the requirements that induce the desired resilient behavior.\nWe then propose a framework to design these behaviors automatically by trading\noff control performance and requirement violations. We analyze this\nresilience-by-compromise method to obtain inverse optimality results and\nquantify the effect of disturbances on the induced requirement relaxations. By\nproving that robustness and resilience optimize different objectives, we show\nthat these are in fact distinct system properties.

In this paper, we focus on a general\nnext-item recommendation setting and propose a practical poisoning attack\napproach named LOKI against blackbox recommendation systems. The proposed LOKI\nutilizes the reinforcement learning algorithm to train the attack agent, which\ncan be used to generate user behavior samples for data poisoning. In real-world\nrecommendation systems, the cost of retraining recommendation models is high,\nand the interaction frequency between users and a recommendation system is\nrestricted.Given these real-world restrictions, we propose to let the agent\ninteract with a recommender simulator instead of the target recommendation\nsystem and leverage the transferability of the generated adversarial samples to\npoison the target system. We also propose to use the influence function to\nefficiently estimate the influence of injected samples on the recommendation\nresults, without re-training the models within the simulator.

The physical principle is the constructive\ninterference of electric field components that undergo multiple optical Hall\neffect induced polarization rotations upon multiple light passages through the\nconductive layer stack. Tuning one of the cavity parameters, such as the\nexternal cavity thickness, permits shifting of the frequencies of the\nconstructive interference, and enhancement of the optical signatures produced\nby the optical Hall effect can be obtained over large spectral regions.

The former\ncorresponds to the case when zonal flows are strong enough to suppress\nturbulence (Dimits regime), while the latter corresponds to the case when zonal\nflows are unstable and turbulence develops.

Our WCE introduces weights to complete\nestimating equations such that the weights can automatically downweight the\noutliers.

These are intertwined with its magnetic\nproperties. Here detailed studies of the magnetic, thermal, and electronic\ntransport properties of EuMg2Bi2 single crystals are presented. The Eu{+2}\nspins-7/2 in EuMg2Bi2 exhibit an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at a\ntemperature TN = 6.7 K, as previously reported. By analyzing the anisotropic\nmagnetic susceptibility chi data below TN in terms of molecular-field theory\n(MFT), the AFM structure is inferred to be a c-axis helix, where the ordered\nmoments in the hexagonal ab-plane layers are aligned ferromagnetically in the\nab plane with a turn angle between the moments in adjacent moment planes along\nthe c axis of about 120 deg. The magnetic heat capacity exhibits a lambda\nanomaly at TN with evidence of dynamic short-range magnetic fluctuations both\nabove and below TN. The high-T limit of the magnetic entropy is close to the\ntheoretical value for spins-7/2. The in-plane electrical resistivity rho(T)\ndata indicate metallic character with a mild and disorder-sensitive upturn\nbelow Tmin = 23 K. An anomalous rapid drop in rho(T) on cooling below TN as\nfound in zero field is replaced by a two-step decrease in magnetic fields. The\nrho(T) measurements also reveal an additional transition below TN in applied\nfields of unknown origin that is not observed in the other measurements and may\nbe associated with an incommensurate to commensurate AFM transition. The\ndependence of TN on the c-axis magnetic field Hperp was derived from the\nfield-dependent chi(T), Cp(T), and rho(T) measurements. This TN(Hperp) was\nfound to be consistent with the prediction of MFT for a c-axis helix with S =\n7/2 and was used to generate a phase diagram in the Hperp-T plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 00:19:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 21:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

In many problems of interest,\nparticles with relativistic energies interact with intense electromagnetic\nfields that have phase velocities near the speed of light. Numerical errors can\narise due to (1) dispersion errors in the phase velocity of the wave, (2) the\nstaggering in time between the electric and magnetic fields and between\nparticle velocity and position and (3) errors in the time derivative in the\nmomentum advance. Errors of the first two kinds are analyzed in detail.

(1) The early evolution\nof all events consists of a slow-rise phase followed by a main-acceleration\nphase, the height-time profiles of which differ markedly and can be best fit,\nrespectively, by a linear and an exponential function. This indicates that\ndifferent physical processes dominate in these phases, which is at variance\nwith models that involve a single process. (2) The kinematic evolution of the\neruptions tends to be synchronized with the flare light curve in both phases.\nThe synchronization is often but not always close. A delayed onset of the\nimpulsive flare phase is found in the majority of the filament eruptions (5 out\nof 6). This delay, and its trend to be larger for slower eruptions, favor ideal\nMHD instability models. (3) The average decay index at the onset heights of the\nmain acceleration is close to the threshold of the torus instability for both\ngroups of events (although based on a tentative coronal field model for the hot\nchannels), suggesting that this instability initiates and possibly drives the\nmain acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 03:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

In this paper, we study a seeded graph matching problem, which assumes\nthat a set of seeds, i.e., pre-mapped vertex-pairs, is given in advance. While\nmost previous work requires all seeds to be correct, we focus on the setting\nwhere the seeds are partially correct. Specifically, consider two correlated\ngraphs whose edges are sampled independently from a parent \\ER graph\n$\\mathcal{G}(n,p)$. A mapping between the vertices of the two graphs is\nprovided as seeds, of which an unknown $\\beta$ fraction is correct. We first\nanalyze a simple algorithm that matches vertices based on the number of common\nseeds in the $1$-hop neighborhoods, and then further propose a new algorithm\nthat uses seeds in the $2$-hop neighborhoods.

Recent methods use homogenous transformation, which\ntransforms the heterogeneous optical and SAR remote sensing images into the\nsame feature space, to achieve change detection. Such transformations mainly\noperate on the low-level feature space and may corrupt the semantic content,\ndeteriorating the performance of change detection. To solve this problem, this\npaper presents a new homogeneous transformation model termed deep homogeneous\nfeature fusion (DHFF) based on image style transfer (IST). Unlike the existing\nmethods, the DHFF method segregates the semantic content and the style features\nin the heterogeneous images to perform homogeneous transformation. The\nseparation of the semantic content and the style in homogeneous transformation\nprevents the corruption of image semantic content, especially in the regions of\nchange. In this way, the detection performance is improved with accurate\nhomogeneous transformation. Furthermore, we present a new iterative IST (IIST)\nstrategy, where the cost function in each IST iteration measures and thus\nmaximizes the feature homogeneity in additional new feature subspaces for\nchange detection. After that, change detection is accomplished accurately on\nthe original and the transformed images that are in the same feature space.\nReal remote sensing images acquired by SAR and optical satellites are utilized\nto evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed DHFF method achieves significant improvement for change\ndetection in heterogeneous optical and SAR remote sensing images, in terms of\nboth accuracy rate and Kappa index.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 06:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-09"}

The PCA confirms the existence of the Gnevyshev gap (GG) for solar\ncycles at about 40% from the start of the cycle. The temporal evolution of\nsunspot area data for even cycles shows that the GG exists at least at the 95%\nconfidence level for all sizes of sunspots. On the other hand, the GG is\nshorter and statistically insignificant for the odd cycles of aerial sunspot\ndata. Furthermore, the analysis of sunspot area sizes for even and odd cycles\nof SC12-SC23 shows that the greatest difference is at 4.2-4.6 years, where even\ncycles have a far smaller total area than odd cycles. The average area of the\nindividual sunspots of even cycles is also smaller in this interval. The\nstatistical analysis of the temporal evolution shows that northern sunspot\ngroups maximise earlier than southern groups for even cycles, but are\nconcurrent for odd cycles. Furthermore, the temporal distributions of odd\ncycles are slightly more leptokurtic than distributions of even cycles.

Our method augments the\ncurrent methods by collecting all the plausible pairwise image registration\ncandidates, among which globally consistent candidates are chosen. This enables\nthe stitching process to determine the correct pairwise registrations by\nutilizing all the available information from the whole imagery, such as\nunambiguous registrations outside the repeating pattern and featureless\nregions.

The edge weights represent the\nplausibility of the transformations. The image transformations and the edge\nweights are solved from a non-linear minimization problem with linear\nconstraints, for which a projection method is used.

First, an analytic form of the\noutput single-photon state of the network driven by a single-photon state is\nderived; in particular, it is observed that coherent feedback elongates\nconsiderably the interaction between the input single photon and the network.\nSecond, excitation probabilities of DQD qubits are computed when the network is\ndriven by a single-photon input state. Moreover, if the input is vacuum but one\nof the two DQD qubits is initialized in its excited state, the explicit\nexpression of the state of the network is derived, in particular, it is shown\nthat the output field and the two DQD qubits can form an entangled state if the\ntransition frequencies of two DQD qubits are equal.

We start by considering an\ninterference-rich scenario such as an ultra-dense FD small-cell network, in\nwhich several non-cooperative FD base stations (BSs) serve their associated UEs\nwhile communicating with a wireless backhaul node (BN) to retrieve the content\nto deliver.

Various systems\nin physics, biology, social sciences and engineering have been successfully\nmodelled as networks of coupled dynamical systems, where the graph links\ndescribe pairwise interactions. This is, however, too strong a limitation, as\nrecent studies have revealed that higher-order many-body interactions are\npresent in social groups, ecosystems and in the human brain, and they actually\naffect the emergent dynamics of all these systems. Here, we introduce a general\nframework that allows to study coupled dynamical systems accounting for the\nprecise microscopic structure of their interactions at any possible order. We\nconsider the most general ensemble of identical dynamical systems, organized on\nthe nodes of a simplicial complex, and interacting through\nsynchronization-non-invasive coupling function. The simplicial complex can be\nof any dimension, meaning that it can account, at the same time, for pairwise\ninteractions, three-body interactions and so on. In such a broad context, we\nshow that complete synchronization exists as an invariant solution, and we give\nthe necessary condition for it to be observed as a stable state in terms of a\nMaster Stability Function. This generalizes the existing results valid for\npairwise interactions (i.e. graphs) to the case of complex systems with the\nmost general possible architecture. Moreover, we show how the approach can be\nsimplified for specific, yet frequently occurring, instances, and we verify all\nour theoretical predictions in synthetic and real-world systems. Given the\ncompletely general character of the method proposed, our results contribute to\nthe theory of dynamical systems with many-body interactions and can find\napplications in an extremely wide range of practical cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 10:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-23"}

A $SU(2)$-equivariant map from $(n+1)$-square matrices to\nfunctions on the $2$-sphere S^2, satisfying some basic properties, is called a\nspin-$j$ symbol correspondence ($n = 2j \\in \\mathbb{N}$). Given a spin-$j$\nsymbol correspondence, the matrix algebra induces a twisted $j$-algebra of\nsymbols.

This\nmore geometric criterion, which in many cases is equivalent to the numerical\ncriterion obtained in [20] for describing symbol correspondence sequences of\n(anti-)Poisson type, is now given in terms of a classical (asymptotic)\nlocalization of symbols of all projectors (quantum pure states) in a certain\nfamily. For some important kinds of symbol correspondence sequences, such a\nclassical localization condition is equivalent to asymptotic emergence of the\nPoisson algebra. But in general, the classical localization condition is\nstronger than Poisson emergence. We thus also consider some weaker notions of\nasymptotic localization of projector-symbols.

Many methods attempt to recovery missing labels by exploiting\nlow-rank structure of label matrix. However, these methods just utilize global\nlow-rank label structure, ignore both local low-rank label structures and label\ndiscriminant information to some extent, leaving room for further performance\nimprovement. In this paper, we develop a simple yet effective discriminant\nmulti-label learning (DM2L) method for multi-label learning with missing\nlabels. Specifically, we impose the low-rank structures on all the predictions\nof instances from the same labels (local shrinking of rank), and a maximally\nseparated structure (high-rank structure) on the predictions of instances from\ndifferent labels (global expanding of rank). In this way, these imposed\nlow-rank structures can help modeling both local and global low-rank label\nstructures, while the imposed high-rank structure can help providing more\nunderlying discriminability. Our subsequent theoretical analysis also supports\nthese intuitions. In addition, we provide a nonlinear extension via using\nkernel trick to enhance DM2L and establish a concave-convex objective to learn\nthese models. Compared to the other methods, our method involves the fewest\nassumptions and only one hyper-parameter. Even so, extensive experiments show\nthat our method still outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 11:49:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 07:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

Our calculation\ninvolves Galactic star-formation histories, metallicity distributions, and the\nlikelihood of stars hosting Earth-like planets in Habitable Zones, under\nspecific assumptions which we describe as the Astrobiological Copernican Weak\nand Strong conditions. These assumptions are based on the one situation in\nwhich intelligent, communicative life is known to exist - on our own planet.\nThis type of life has developed in a metal-rich environment and has taken\nroughly 5 Gyr to do so. We investigate the possible number of CETI based on\ndifferent scenarios.

The other is the Strong Condition in which life must form between\n4.5 to 5.5 Gyr, as on Earth. In the Strong Condition (a strict set of\nassumptions), there should be at least 36$_{-32}^{+175}$ civilizations within\nour Galaxy: this is a lower limit, based on the assumption that the average\nlife-time, L, of a communicating civilization is 100 years (based on our own at\npresent).

The procedure exploits a general vector\nautoregressive representation of the time-reversed series of Fourier\ncoefficients appearing in the Karhunen-Loeve representation of the functional\nprocess. It generates backward-in-time, functional replicates that adequately\nmimic the dependence structure of the underlying process in a model-free way\nand have the same conditionally fixed curves at the end of each functional\npseudo-time series. The bootstrap prediction error distribution is then\ncalculated as the difference between the model-free, bootstrap-generated future\nfunctional observations and the functional forecasts obtained from the model\nused for prediction. This allows the estimated prediction error distribution to\naccount for the innovation and estimation errors associated with prediction and\nthe possible errors due to model misspecification. We establish the asymptotic\nvalidity of the bootstrap procedure in estimating the conditional prediction\nerror distribution of interest, and we also show that the procedure enables the\nconstruction of prediction bands that achieve (asymptotically) the desired\ncoverage.

In PSI protocols, often two\nparties hope to find their common set elements without needing to disclose\ntheir uncommon ones. In recent years, the cloud has been playing an influential\nrole in PSI protocols which often need huge computational tasks. In 2017, Abadi\net al. introduced a scheme named EO-PSI which uses a cloud to pass on the main\ncomputations to it and does not include any public-key operations. In EO-PSI,\nparties need to set up secure channels beforehand; otherwise, an attacker can\neasily eavesdrop on communications between honest parties and find private\ninformation. This paper presents an improved EO-PSI scheme which has the edge\non the previous scheme in terms of privacy and complexity. By providing\npossible attacks on the prior scheme, we show the necessity of using secure\nchannels between parties.

We built a\nparametric function that represents the spectral form of the synthetic bursts\nprovided by our internal shock synchrotron model (ISSM). We simulated the\nresponse of the Fermi instruments to the synthetic bursts and fitted the\nobtained count spectra to validate the ISSM function. Then, we applied this\nfunction to a sample of 74 bright GRBs detected by the Fermi/GBM, and we\ncomputed the width of their spectral energy distributions around their peak\nenergy. For comparison, we fitted also the phenomenological functions that are\ncommonly used in the literature. Finally, we performed a time-resolved analysis\nof the broadband spectrum of GRB 090926A, which was jointly detected by the\nFermi GBM and LAT. The ISSM function reproduces 81% of the spectra in the GBM\nbright GRB sample, versus 59% for the Band function, for the same number of\nparameters. It gives also relatively good fits to the GRB 090926A spectra. The\nwidth of the MeV spectral component that is obtained from the fits of the ISSM\nfunction is slightly larger than the width from the Band fits, but it is\nsmaller when observed over a wider energy range. Moreover, all of the 74\nanalysed spectra are found to be significantly wider than the synthetic\nsynchrotron spectra.

Finally, we pinpoint how the behavior of each agent\nderives from their learning style and create a baseline for future research on\nthis scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 14:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-09"}

In each case, the\ngap equation is derived and the effects of the non-Hermitian terms on the\ngenerated mass are studied. We have several findings: in previous calculations\nfor the free Dirac equation modified to include non-Hermitian bilinear terms,\ncontrary to expectation, no real mass spectrum can be obtained in the chiral\nlimit; in these cases a nonzero bare fermion mass is essential for the\nrealization of PT symmetry in the unbroken regime.

Thus, the four-point interaction overrides the effects leading to PT\nsymmetry-breaking for these parameter values. Further, we find that in both\ncases, in 3+1 and in 1+1 dimensions, the inclusion of a non-Hermitian bilinear\nterm can contribute to the generated mass. In both models, this contribution\ncan be tuned to be small; we thus fix the fermion mass to its value when\n$m_0=0$ in the absence of the non-Hermitian term, and then determine the value\nof the coupling required so as to generate a bare fermion mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 14:29:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

The domains are\nobtained by removing small geodesic balls that are asymptotically densely\nuniformly distributed as their radius tends to zero. We use this relationship\nto construct manifolds that have large Steklov eigenvalues.\n  In dimension two, and with constant weight equal to 1, we prove that\nKokarev's upper bound of $8\\pi$ for the first nonzero normalised Steklov\neigenvalue on orientable surfaces of genus 0 is saturated. For other\ntopological types and eigenvalue indices, we also obtain lower bounds on the\nbest upper bound for the eigenvalue in terms of Laplace maximisers. For the\nfirst two eigenvalues, these lower bounds become equalities. A surprising\nconsequence is the existence of free boundary minimal surfaces immersed in the\nunit ball by first Steklov eigenfunctions and with area strictly larger than\n$2\\pi$. This was previously thought to be impossible. We provide numerical\nevidence that some of the already known examples of free boundary minimal\nsurfaces have these properties and also exhibit simulations of new free\nboundary minimal surfaces of genus 0 in the unit ball with even larger area.\nThe first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue of all these examples is equal to 1, as a\nconsequence of their symmetries and topology, so that they verify a general\nconjecture by Fraser and Li.\n  In dimension three and larger, we prove that the isoperimetric inequality of\nColbois--El Soufi--Girouard is sharp and implies an upper bound for weighted\nLaplace eigenvalues. We also show that in any manifold with a fixed metric, one\ncan construct by varying the weight a domain with connected boundary whose\nfirst nonzero normalised Steklov eigenvalue is arbitrarily large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 15:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

A monolayer of azobenzene\nmolecules defines how the liquid crystal's optical axis mechanically couples to\nthe particle's surface, as well as how they jointly rotate as the light's\npolarization changes. The rotating particle twists the liquid crystal, which\nchanges polarization of traversing light. The resulting feedback mechanism\nyields a continuous opto-mechanical cycle and drives the unidirectional\nparticle spinning, with handedness and frequency robustly controlled by\npolarization and intensity of light. Our findings may lead to opto-mechanical\ndevices and colloidal machines compatible with liquid crystal display\ntechnology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 15:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-09"}

At the evolved stage of the active region, the\npixels with ratios smaller than two were located on the periphery, whereas\nthose with values larger than 2 were in the core. However, for quiet Sun\nregions, the obtained intensity ratios were close to two irrespective of the\nlocation on the disk. Our findings suggest that the \\ion{Si}{4} lines observed\nin active regions are affected by the opacity during the early phase of the\nflux emergence. The results obtained here could have important implications for\nthe modelling of the solar atmosphere, including the initial stage of the\nemergence of an active region as well as quiet Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 07:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

The information displayed was useful in half of the\nconsultations according to the clinicians who answered the questionnaire.\nDespite this, the overwhelming majority of clinicians who answered the\nquestionnaire found that the designed FullFlow system permitted to gain\ninsights of the situation of the patients. The study showed the higher the PGHD\nreliability is, the more useful the system is for clinicians. PGHD usage in\nclinical settings can permit clinicians to gain valuable information regarding\nthe situations of their patients. A clinical decision system can present useful\ninformation to clinicians. While the PGHD reliability is correlated to the\nusefulness of such system, it is not the only factor impacting it: context of\nthe clinicians and patients such as novelty of usage and personal goals also\nplays a role in determining on how such system is useful for clinicians.\nHowever, due to a limited number of participants, a new medical pilot must be\nperformed in order to confirm the results of this study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 09:46:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-27"}

By incorporating the multigrid concept that the\ncomputational errors on the fine mesh can be approximated with those on the\ncoarse mesh, this algorithm stochastically divides all boundary nodes into $m$\ngroups and uses the locally maximum radial basis functions (RBF) interpolation\nerror of each group as an approximation to the globally maximum one of all\nboundary nodes in each iterative procedure for reducing the RBF support nodes.\nFor this reason, it avoids the interpolation conducted at all boundary nodes\nand thus reduces the corresponding computational complexity from\n$O\\left({N_c^2{N_b}} \\right)$ to $O\\left( {N_c^3} \\right)$. Besides, after $m$\niterations, the interpolation errors of all boundary nodes are computed once,\nthus allowing all boundary nodes can contribute to error control. Two canonical\ndeformation problems of the ONERA M6 wing and the DLR-F6\nWing-Body-Nacelle-Pylon configuration are computed to validate the GCB greedy\nalgorithm. The computational results show that the GCB greedy algorithm is able\nto remarkably promote the efficiency of computing the interpolation errors in\nthe data reducing procedure by dozens of times. Because an increase of $m$\nresults in an increase of $N_c$, an appropriate range of $\\left[\n{{N_b}/{N_c},{\\rm{ }}2{N_b}/{N_c}}\\right]$ for $m$ is suggested to prevent too\nmuch additional computations for solving the linear algebraic system and\ncomputing the displacements of volume nodes induced by the increase of $N_c $.\nThe results also show that the GCB greedy algorithm tends to generate a more\nsignificant efficiency improvement for mesh deformation when a larger-scale\nmesh is applied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 12:30:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 14:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

However, for a given transaction, not\nevery network state provides a feasible route to perform the payment; in this\ncase, the transaction must be put on the public ledger. The payment channel\nnetwork thus multiplies the transaction rate of the overall system; the less\nfrequently it fails, the higher the multiplier.\n  We build on earlier work on credit networks and show that this network\nliquidity problem is connected to the combinatorics of graphical matroids.\nEarlier work could only analyze the (unnatural) scenario where transactions had\ndiscrete sizes.\n  Superficially, it might seem like the continuous case would be harder to\nexamine.

In\nparticular, the faster and slower recursions have non-additive controlled\nMarkov noise components in addition to martingale difference noise. We analyze\nthe asymptotic behavior of our framework by relating it to limiting\ndifferential inclusions in both time scales that are defined in terms of the\nergodic occupation measures associated with the controlled Markov processes.\nUsing a special case of our results, we present a solution to the off-policy\nconvergence problem for temporal-difference learning with linear function\napproximation. We compile several aspects of the dynamics of stochastic\napproximation algorithms with Markov iterate-dependent noise when the iterates\nare not known to be stable beforehand. We achieve the same by extending the\nlock-in probability (i.e. the probability of convergence to a specific\nattractor of the limiting o.d.e. given that the iterates are in its domain of\nattraction after a sufficiently large number of iterations (say) n_0) framework\nto such recursions.

This, in turn, is shown to be useful in\nanalyzing the tracking ability of general \"adaptive\" algorithms. Finally, we\nobtain the first informative error bounds on function approximation for the\npolicy evaluation algorithm proposed by Basu et al. when the aim is to find the\nrisk-sensitive cost represented using exponential utility.
