For both deterministic and stochastic\ndynamics specific classes of models verify Palis' conjecture: the long-term\nbehavior is determined by a finite number of stationary distributions. In this\npaper we consider the classification problem for stochastic models of\ninteracting species. For a large class of three-species, stochastic\ndifferential equation models, we prove a variant of Palis' conjecture: the\nlong-term statistical behavior is determined by a finite number of stationary\ndistributions and, generically, three general types of behavior are possible:\n1) convergence to a unique stationary distribution that supports all species,\n2) convergence to one of a finite number of stationary distributions supporting\ntwo or fewer species, 3) convergence to convex combinations of single species,\nstationary distributions due to a rock-paper-scissors type of dynamic.\nMoreover, we prove that the classification reduces to computing Lyapunov\nexponents (external Lyapunov exponents) that correspond to the average\nper-capita growth rate of species when rare. Our results stand in contrast to\nthe deterministic setting where the classification is incomplete even for\nthree-dimensional, competitive Lotka--Volterra systems. For these SDE models,\nour results also provide a rigorous foundation for ecology's modern coexistence\ntheory (MCT) which assumes the external Lyapunov exponents determine long-term\necological outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 16:03:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 13:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Being landslides in seismically\nactively regions closely controlled by the ground motion, one would expect that\nlandslide susceptibility maps should change as the ground motion patterns\nchange in space and time. However, so far, statistically-based landslide\nsusceptibility assessments have primarily been used as time-invariant.In other\nwords, the vast majority of the statistical models does not include the\ntemporal effect of the main trigger in future landslide scenarios. In this\nwork, we present an approach aimed at filling this gap, bridging current\npractices in the seismological community to those in the geomorphological and\nstatistical ones. More specifically, we select an earthquake-induced landslide\ninventory corresponding to the 1994 Northridge earthquake and build a Bayesian\nGeneralized Additive Model of the binomial family, featuring common\nmorphometric and thematic covariates as well as the Peak Ground Acceleration\ngenerated by the Northridge earthquake.

And yet, the temporal component of the trigger is rarely included in\nlandslide susceptibility studies and only confined to hazard assessment. In\nthis work, we investigate a population of landslides triggered in response to\nthe 2017 Jiuzhaigou earthquake ($M_w = 6.5$) including the associated ground\nmotion in the analyses, these being carried out at the Slope Unit (SU) level.\nWe do this by implementing a Bayesian version of a Generalized Additive Model\nand assuming that the slope instability across the SUs in the study area\nbehaves according to a Bernoulli probability distribution. This procedure would\ngenerally produce a susceptibility map reflecting the spatial pattern of the\nspecific trigger and therefore of limited use for land use planning. However,\nwe implement this first analytical step to reliably estimate the ground motion\neffect, and its distribution, on unstable SUs. We then assume the effect of the\nground motion to be time-invariant, enabling statistical simulations for any\nground motion scenario that occurred in the area from 1933 to 2017. As a\nresult, we obtain the full spectrum of potential susceptibility patterns over\nthe last century and compress this information into a susceptibility model/map\nrepresentative of all the possible ground motion patterns since 1933.

While generating\nthe classifier on a local scope may make it easier for singling out the locally\ncompetent ones, as in the online local pool (OLP) technique, using the same\nbase-classifier model in uneven distributions may restrict the local level of\ncompetence, since each region may have a data distribution that favors one\nmodel over the others. Thus, we propose in this work a problem-independent\ndynamic base-classifier model recommendation for the OLP technique, which uses\ninformation regarding the behavior of a portfolio of models over the samples of\ndifferent problems to recommend one (or several) of them on a per-instance\nmanner. Our proposed framework builds a multi-label meta-classifier responsible\nfor recommending a set of relevant model types based on the local data\ncomplexity of the region surrounding each test sample. The OLP technique then\nproduces a local pool with the model that yields the highest probability score\nof the meta-classifier. Experimental results show that different data\ndistributions favored different model types on a local scope. Moreover, based\non the performance of an ideal model type selector, it was observed that there\nis a clear advantage in choosing a relevant model type for each test instance.\nOverall, the proposed model type recommender system yielded a statistically\nsimilar performance to the original OLP with fixed base-classifier model. Given\nthe novelty of the approach and the gap in performance between the proposed\nframework and the ideal selector, we regard this as a promising research\ndirection.

Given the images of two people: a person and a model, it generates a\nrendition of the person wearing the clothes of the model. This is useful\nconsidering the fact that on most e-commerce websites images of only clothes\nare not usually available. We follow a three-stage approach to achieve our\nobjective. In the first stage, LGVTON warps the clothes of the model using a\nThin-Plate Spline (TPS) based transformation to fit the person. Unlike previous\nTPS-based methods, we use the landmarks (of human and clothes) to compute the\nTPS transformation. This enables the warping to work independently of the\ncomplex patterns, such as stripes, florals, and textures, present on the\nclothes. However, this computed warp may not always be very precise. We,\ntherefore, further refine it in the subsequent stages with the help of a mask\ngenerator (Stage 2) and an image synthesizer (Stage 3) modules. The mask\ngenerator improves the fit of the warped clothes, and the image synthesizer\nensures a realistic output. To tackle the problem of lack of paired training\ndata, we resort to a self-supervised training strategy. Here paired data refers\nto the image pair of model and person wearing the same cloth. We compare LGVTON\nwith four existing methods on two popular fashion datasets namely MPV and\nDeepFashion using two performance measures, FID (Fr\\'echet Inception Distance)\nand SSIM (Structural Similarity Index).

We consider auxiliary tasks which learn to make on-policy\npredictions using temporal difference learning. We test the impact of\nprediction timescale using a specific form of auxiliary task in which the input\nimage is used as the prediction target, which we refer to as temporal\ndifference autoencoders (TD-AE). We empirically evaluate the effect of TD-AE on\nthe A2C algorithm in the VizDoom environment using different prediction\ntimescales. While we do not observe a clear relationship between the prediction\ntimescale on performance, we make the following observations: 1) using\nauxiliary tasks allows us to reduce the trajectory length of the A2C algorithm,\n2) in some cases temporally extended TD-AE performs better than a straight\nautoencoder, 3) performance with auxiliary tasks is sensitive to the weight\nplaced on the auxiliary loss, 4) despite this sensitivity, auxiliary tasks\nimproved performance without extensive hyper-parameter tuning.

We may also consider as a constraint that\nthe deep neural network must be implemented in a chip with an area below some\nsize. Here, both the objectives and the constraint are black boxes, i.e.,\nfunctions whose analytical expressions are unknown and are expensive to\nevaluate. Bayesian optimization (BO) methodologies have given state-of-the-art\nresults for the optimization of black-boxes.

Specifically, it has been known for more than 20 years\nthat when all players seek to minimize their internal regret in a repeated\nnormal-form game, the empirical frequency of play converges to a normal-form\ncorrelated equilibrium. Extensive-form (that is, tree-form) games generalize\nnormal-form games by modeling both sequential and simultaneous moves, as well\nas private information. Because of the sequential nature and presence of\npartial information in the game, extensive-form correlation has significantly\ndifferent properties than the normal-form counterpart, many of which are still\nopen research directions. Extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE) has been\nproposed as the natural extensive-form counterpart to normal-form correlated\nequilibrium.

When each player has low trigger regret, the empirical\nfrequency of play is close to an EFCE. Then, we give an efficient\nno-trigger-regret algorithm.

Using the stellar-evolution code MESA, we computed evolutionary\ntracks of stars at different metallicities, exploring variations of factors\nknown to affect the radial expansion (e.g. semiconvection, overshooting,\nrotation). We find observational support for an evolution in which already at\nmetallicity $0.2Z_{\\odot}$ massive stars remain relatively compact during the\nHertzprung-Gap (HG) phase and most of their expansion occurs during core-helium\nburning (CHeB). Consequently, we show that metallicity has a strong influence\non the type of mass transfer evolution in binary systems. At solar metallicity,\na case-B mass transfer is initiated shortly after the end of MS, and a giant\ndonor is almost always a rapidly expanding HG star. At lower metallicity, the\nparameter space for mass transfer from a more evolved CHeB star increases\ndramatically. This means that envelope stripping and formation of helium stars\nin low-metallicity environments occurs later in the evolution of the donor,\nimplying a much shorter duration of the Wolf-Rayet phase (even by an order of\nmagnitude) and higher final core masses. This metallicity effect is independent\nof the impact of metallicity-dependent stellar winds. At very low\nmetallicities, a significant fraction of massive stars in binaries engages in\nthe first episode of mass transfer very late into their evolution, when they\nalready have a well-developed CO core.

We study this\nproblem from the perspective of Parameterized Complexity: we consider several\nnatural parameters such as the number of layers, the number of agents, the\nnumber of items, and the maximum length of a preference list. We present a\ncomprehensive picture of the parameterized complexity of the problem with\nrespect to these parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 18:17:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 16:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

Compared to other supergiant HMXBs, the Fe K$\\alpha$ line\nequivalent width is low in SMC X-1 - from less than 10 eV in high state to up\nto $\\sim$ 270 eV in the low states. The spectral shape is dependent on flux\nwith the hard X-ray spectrum steepening with increasing flux.

The fueling and feedback of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are important\nin understanding the co-evolution between black holes and host galaxies.\nMergers are thought to have the capability to bring gas inwards and ignite\nnuclear activity, especially for more powerful AGNs. However, there is still\nsignificant ongoing debate on whether mergers can trigger AGNs and, if they do,\nwhether mergers are a significant triggering mechanism. Methods. We select a\nlow-redshift ($0.005<z<0.1$) sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nand a high-redshift ($0 < z < 0.6$) sample from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly\n(GAMA) survey.

We also include Low Excitation Radio\nGalaxies (LERGs) to investigate the connection between mergers and low\naccretion rate AGNs. Results. We find that AGNs are more likely to be found in\nmergers than non-mergers, with an AGN excess up to $1.81\\pm{0.16}$, suggesting\nthat mergers can trigger AGNs. We also find the fraction of mergers in AGNs is\nhigher than that in non-AGN controls, for both MIR and optically selected AGNs,\nas well as LERGs, with values between $16.40\\pm{0.5}\\%$ and $39.23\\pm{2.10}\\%$,\nimplying a non-negligible to potentially significant role of mergers in\ntriggering AGNs. This merger fraction in AGNs increases as stellar mass\nincreases which supports the idea that mergers are more important for\ntriggering AGNs in more massive galaxies. In terms of merger fraction as a\nfunction of AGN power we find a positive trend for MIR selected AGNs and a\ncomplex trend for optically selected AGNs, which we interpret under an\nevolutionary scenario proposed by previous studies. In addition, obscured MIR\nselected AGNs are more likely to be hosted in mergers than unobscured MIR\nselected AGNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 19:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

The previously introduced model of\nclosed self-organized criticality (SOC), is adapted in the case of a\nvirus-induced epidemic. In this version this physical model can distinguish the\nvirus spread according to the virus aggressiveness. The study presented,\nhighlights the critical value of virus density over a population. For low\nvalues of the initial virus density (lower than the critical value) it is\nproved that the virus-diffusion behavior is safe and quantitatively similar to\nusual real epidemical data. However, it is revealed that very close to the\ncritical point, the critical slowing-down (CSD) phenomenon, introduced by the\ntheory of critical phenomena, emerges, leading to a tremendous increase of both\nthe percentage of active carriers and the duration of the epidemic. A behavior\nof the epidemic obeying to a second order phase transition, also occurs. For\nvirus density values higher than the critical value, the epidemic duration\nbecomes extremely prolonged. Additionally, the effect of the closed system\npopulation size revealed interesting properties. All these results, together\nwith an investigation of the effectiveness of applying physical contact\nrestriction measures, document scientifically their worthiness, while they also\ndemonstrate the limits for which herd immunity holds safely.

The learning problem then is a minimization problem subject to\nthat fractional ODE as constraints. We emphasize that an analogy between the\nexisting DNN and ODEs, with standard time derivative, is well-known by now. The\nfocus of our work is the Fractional-DNN. Using the Lagrangian approach, we\nprovide a derivation of the backward propagation and the design equations.

We\nvalidate the correction using NIST standard polydisperse particles undergoing\ndifferential settling, and then apply the correction to polydisperse spray\ndroplet measurements. The correction improves agreement between LD and DIH size\ndistributions for droplets over two orders of magnitude, but with LD still\nunderestimating the fraction of droplets at sizes above ~1 mm. This\nunderestimation is possibly linked to the complex oscillatory and rotational\nmotion of droplets which cannot be faithfully captured by measurement or\nmodelled by the correction algorithm without additional information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 23:41:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 18:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

For these applications, to ensure\nthe robot can predictably locomote, the interaction between the terrain and\nvehicle, terramechanics, must be incorporated into the model of the robot's\nlocomotion. Modeling terramechanic effects is difficult and may be impossible\nin situations where the terrain is not known a priori. For these reasons,\nlearning a terramechanics model online is desirable to increase the\npredictability of the robot's motion. A problem with previous implementations\nof learning algorithms is that the terramechanics model and corresponding\ngenerated control policies are not easily interpretable or extensible. If the\nmodels were of interpretable form, designers could use the learned models to\ninform vehicle and/or control design changes to refine the robot architecture\nfor future applications.

The proposed method yields an interpretable model, which can be\nanalyzed using preexisting analysis methods. The paper provides simulation\nresults that show for a practical application, the genetic algorithm\nperformance is approximately equal to the performance of a state-of-the-art\nneural network approach, which does not provide an easily interpretable model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 00:12:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-03"}

To help understand the\nhighly non-equilibrium nature of buoyancy-driven HVDT, the flow evolution is\ndivided into four different regimes based on the behavior of turbulent kinetic\nenergy derivatives. The results show that each regime has a unique type of\ndependency on both Atwood and Reynolds numbers. It is found that the local\nstatistics of the flow based on the flow composition are more sensitive to\nAtwood and Reynolds numbers compared to those based on the entire flow. It is\nalso observed that at higher Atwood numbers, different flow features reach\ntheir asymptotic Reynolds number behavior at different times. The energy\nspectrum defined based on the Favre fluctuations momentum has less large scale\ncontamination from viscous effects for variable density flows with constant\nproperties, compared to other forms used previously. The evolution of the\nenergy spectrum highlights distinct dynamical features of the four flow\nregimes. Thus, the slope of the energy spectrum at intermediate to large scales\nevolves from -7/3 to -1, as a function of the production to dissipation ratio.\nThe classical Kolmogorov spectrum emerges at intermediate to high scales at the\nhighest Reynolds numbers examined, after the turbulence starts to decay.\nFinally, the similarities and differences between buoyancy-driven HVDT and the\nmore conventional stationary turbulence are discussed and new strategies and\ntools for analysis are proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 00:28:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

The tool that\nmakes the nexus between electricity generation on the physical side and the\nconsumers and the critical loads on the social side is the power flow\nalgorithm. Specifically, the levels of emotion, empathy, cooperation, and the\nphysical health of the consumers, prosumers are modeled in the proposed\ncommunity resilience optimization approach while accounting for the electric\npower system constraints and their impact on the critical loads, which include\nhospitals, shelters, and gas stations, to name a few. The optimization accounts\nfor the fact that the level of satisfaction of the society, the living\nstandards, and the social well-being are depended on the supply of energy,\nincluding electricity. Evidently, the lack of electric energy resulting from\nload shedding has an impact on both the mental and the psychical quality of\nlife, which in turn affects the community resilience. The developed constrained\ncommunity resilience optimization method is applied to two case studies,\nincluding a two-area 6-buses system and a modified IEEE RTS 24-bus system.\nSimulation results reveal that a decrease in the initial values of the emotion,\nthe risk perception, and the social media platform effect factor entails an\nincrease in load shedding, which in turn results in a decrease in community\nresilience.

The motivation behind our questions, however, comes from\nmore general energy integrals of mathematical models of Hyperelasticity. The\nDirichlet Principle, the name coined by Riemann, tells us that the outer\nvariation of a harmonic mapping increases its energy. Surprisingly, when one\njumps into details about inner variations, which are just a change of\nindependent variables, new equations and related questions start to matter. The\ninner variational equation, called the Hopf Laplace equation, is no longer the\nLaplace equation. Its solutions are generally not harmonic; we refer to them as\nHopf harmonics. The natural question that arises is how does a change of\nvariables in the domain of a Hopf harmonic map affect its energy? We show,\namong other results, that in case of a simply connected domain the energy\nincreases. This should be viewed as Riemann's Dirichlet Principle for Hopf\nharmonics.\n  The Dirichlet Principle for Hopf harmonics in domains of higher connectivity\nis not completely solved. What complicates the matter is the insufficient\nknowledge of global structure of trajectories of the associated Hopf quadratic\ndifferentials, mainly because of the presence of recurrent trajectories.\nNevertheless, we have established the Dirichlet Principle whenever the Hopf\ndifferential admits closed trajectories and crosscuts. Regardless of these\nassumptions, we established the so-called Infinitesimal Dirichlet Principle for\nall domains and all Hopf harmonics. Precisely, the second order term of inner\nvariation of a Hopf harmonic map is always nonnegative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 02:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-03"}

Each player selects\nher parameters based not only on her informational level but also on her\nparticular preferences. The first part of the work is where we examine the\nunconstrained problem, in which traders do not necessarily have to reach the\nend of the horizon with vanishing inventory. In the sequel, we proceed to\nanalyze the constrained situation as an asymptotic limit of the previous one.\nWe prove the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium in both frameworks,\nalongside a characterization, under suitable assumptions. We conclude the paper\nby presenting an extension of the basic model to a hierarchical market, for\nwhich we establish the existence, uniqueness, and characterization of a\nStackelberg-Nash equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 03:08:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 16:57:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 12:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

The challenges of CMKF are debiasing the converted measurement\nand approximating the converted measurement error covariance.

A key\nchallenge of this task is how to alleviate the data distribution discrepancy\nbetween the source and target domains, i.e. reducing domain shift. The common\napproach to this problem is to minimize the discrepancy between feature\ndistributions from different domains through adversarial training. However,\ndirectly aligning the feature distribution globally cannot guarantee\nconsistency from a local view (i.e. semantic-level), which prevents certain\nsemantic knowledge learned on the source domain from being applied to the\ntarget domain. To tackle this issue, we propose a semi-supervised approach\nnamed Alleviating Semantic-level Shift (ASS), which can successfully promote\nthe distribution consistency from both global and local views. Specifically,\nleveraging a small number of labeled data from the target domain, we directly\nextract semantic-level feature representations from both the source and the\ntarget domains by averaging the features corresponding to same categories\nadvised by pixel-level masks. We then feed the produced features to the\ndiscriminator to conduct semantic-level adversarial learning, which\ncollaborates with the adversarial learning from the global view to better\nalleviate the domain shift. We apply our ASS to two domain adaptation tasks,\nfrom GTA5 to Cityscapes and from Synthia to Cityscapes. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that: (1) ASS can significantly outperform the current unsupervised\nstate-of-the-arts by employing a small number of annotated samples from the\ntarget domain; (2) ASS can beat the oracle model trained on the whole target\ndataset by over 3 points by augmenting the synthetic source data with annotated\nsamples from the target domain without suffering from the prevalent problem of\noverfitting to the source domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 03:25:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 22:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

Motivated by recent applications of coding theory, in this\npaper, we consider the case where the process of encoding is distributed and\nprone to error. We introduce the problem of distributed encoding, comprising of\n$K\\in\\mathbb{N}$ isolated source nodes and $N\\in\\mathbb{N}$ encoding nodes.\nEach source node has one symbol from a finite field and sends it to all\nencoding nodes. Each encoding node stores an encoded symbol, as a function of\nthe received symbols. However, some of the source nodes are controlled by the\nadversary and may send different symbols to different encoding nodes. Depending\non the number of adversarial nodes, denoted by $\\beta\\in\\mathbb{N}$, and the\nnumber of symbols that each one generates, denoted by $v\\in\\mathbb{N}$, the\nprocess of decoding from the encoded symbols could be impossible. Assume that a\ndecoder connects to an arbitrary subset of $t \\in\\mathbb{N}$ encoding nodes and\nwants to decode the symbols of the honest nodes correctly, without necessarily\nidentifying the sets of honest and adversarial nodes. In this paper, we study\n$t^*\\in\\mathbb{N}$, the minimum of $t$, which is a function of $K$, $N$,\n$\\beta$, and $v$. We show that when the encoding nodes use linear coding,\n$t^*_{\\textrm{linear}}=K+2\\beta(v-1)$, if $N\\ge K+2\\beta(v-1)$, and\n$t^*_{\\textrm{linear}}=N$, if $N\\le K+2\\beta(v-1)$. In order to achieve\n$t^*_{\\textrm{linear}}$, we use random linear coding and show that in any\nfeasible solution that the decoder finds, the messages of the honest nodes are\ndecoded correctly. For the converse of the fundamental limit, we show that when\nthe adversary behaves in a particular way, it can always confuse the decoder\nbetween two feasible solutions that differ in the message of at least one\nhonest node.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 04:34:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 04:10:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 17:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

However, in real-world\nscenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby\nprecluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or remove) in\norder to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic.\nHere, we study a novel immunization strategy where only $n$ nodes are observed\nat a time and the most central between these $n$ nodes is immunized (or\nattacked). This process is continued repeatedly until $1-p$ fraction of nodes\nare immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this\napproach and determine the critical percolation threshold $p_c$ and the size of\nthe giant component $P_{\\infty}$ for networks with arbitrary degree\ndistributions $P(k)$. In the limit of $n\\to\\infty$ we recover prior work on\ntargeted attack, whereas for $n=1$ we recover the known case of random failure.\nBetween these two extremes, we observe that as $n$ increases, $p_c$ increases\nquickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with\ncomplete information.

With the Kingman coalescent and the backward\ndiffusion equation, inference of the marginal likelihood proceeds from an\nextant sample backward in time. Conditional on an extant sample, the Moran\nmodel can also be used backward in time with identical results, up to a scaling\nof time. In particular, all three approaches -- the coalescent, the backward\ndiffusion, and the Moran model -- lead to the identical marginal likelihood of\nthe sample. If probabilities of ancestral states are also inferred, either of\ndiscrete ancestral allele particle configurations, as in the coalescent, or of\nancestral population allele proportions, as in the backward diffusion, the\nbackward algorithm needs to be combined with the corresponding forward\nalgorithm to the forward-backward algorithm. Generally orthogonal polynomials,\nsolving the diffusion equation, are numerically simpler than the other\napproaches: they implicitly sum over many intermediate ancestral particle\nconfigurations; furthermore, while the Moran model requires iterative matrix\nmultiplication with a transition matrix of a dimension of the population size\nsquared, expansion of the polynomials is only necessary up to the sample size.\nFor discrete samples, forward-in-time moving pure birth processes similar to\nthe Polya- or Hoppe-urn models complement the backward-looking coalescent.\nBecause, the sample size is a random variable forward in time, pure-birth\nprocesses are unsuited to model population demography given extant samples.\nWith orthogonal polynomials, however, not only ancestral allele proportions but\nalso probabilities of ancestral particle configurations can be calculated\neasily.

Due to the heterogeneous\nnature of the network,the UAVs may cause severe interference to the\ntransmissions of each other. Hence, a judicious design of the user-UAV\nassociation and UAV locations is desired. A potential game is defined where the\nplayers are the UAVs. The potential function is the total sum-rate of the\nusers. The agents utility in the potential games is their marginal contribution\nto the global welfare or their so-called wonderful life utility. A\ngame-theoretic learning algorithm, binary log-linear learning (BLLL), is then\napplied to the problem. Given the potential game structure, a consequence of\nour utility design, the stochastically stable states using BLLL are guaranteed\nto be the potential maximizers. Hence, we optimally solve the user-UAV\nassociation and 3D-location problem.

Below the critical pressure (PC) of 2.7\nGPa, our data reveal that the hole - electron carriers are thermally balanced\n(RH=0) at a critical temperature (T*), where RH changes its sign from positive\nto negative, and concurrently a tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition takes\nplace. Within the pressure range from 1bar to PC, T* is continuously suppressed\nby pressure, while TC increases monotonically. At about PC, T* is\nindistinguishable and TC reaches a maximum value. Moreover, a pressure-induced\nsign change of RH is found at ~PC where the orthorhombic-monoclinic phase\ntransition occurs. With further compression, TC decreases and disappears at ~\n12 GPa. The correlation among the electron-hole balance, crystal structure and\nsuperconductivity found in the pressurized FeTe0.55Se0.45 implies that its\nnontrivial superconductivity is closely associated with its exotic normal state\nresulted from the interplay between the reconstruction of the Fermi surface and\nthe change of the structural lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 08:02:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 13:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

Reinforcement learning is based on the well-studied\ndynamic programming technique and thus also aims at finding the best stationary\npolicy for a given Markov Decision Process, but in contrast does not require\nany model knowledge. The policy is assessed solely on consecutive states (or\nstate-action pairs), which are observed while an agent explores the solution\nspace. The contributions of this paper are manifold. First we provide deep\ntheoretical insights to the widely applied standard discounted reinforcement\nlearning framework, which give rise to the understanding of why these\nalgorithms are inappropriate when permanently provided with non-zero rewards,\nsuch as costs or profit. Second, we establish a novel near-Blackwell-optimal\nreinforcement learning algorithm. In contrary to former method it assesses the\naverage reward per step separately and thus prevents the incautious combination\nof different types of state values. Thereby, the Laurent Series expansion of\nthe discounted state values forms the foundation for this development and also\nprovides the connection between the two approaches. Finally, we prove the\nviability of our algorithm on a challenging problem set, which includes a\nwell-studied M/M/1 admission control queuing system. In contrast to standard\ndiscounted reinforcement learning our algorithm infers the optimal policy on\nall tested problems. The insights are that in the operations research domain\nmachine learning techniques have to be adapted and advanced to successfully\napply these methods in our settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 08:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-03"}

We investigate how the\nkey results are affected by two popular approximations. One is to implement the\nstreaming by accounting for only the relative motion while assuming ``baryons\ntrace dark matter\" spatially at the initialization of simulation. This neglects\nthe smoothing on the gas density taking place before the initialization. In our\nsimulation initialized at $z_i=200$, it overestimates the gas density power\nspectrum by up to 40\\% at $k\\approx10^2~h~\\mbox{Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=20$. Halo mass\n($M_h$) and baryonic fraction in halos ($f_{b,h}$) are also overestimated, but\nthe relation between the two remains unchanged. The other approximation tested\nis to artificially amplify the density/velocity fluctuations in the cosmic mean\ndensity to simulate the first minihalos that form in overdense regions. This\ngives a head start to the halo growth while the subsequent growth is similar to\nthat in the mean density. The growth in a true overdense region, on the other\nhand, is accelerated gradually in time. For example, raising $\\sigma_8$ by 50\\%\neffectively transforms $z\\rightarrow\\sqrt{1.5}z$ in the halo mass growth\nhistory while in 2-$\\sigma$ overdensity, the growth is accelerated by a\nconstant in redshift: $z\\rightarrow{z+4.8}$. As a result, halos have grown more\nin the former than in the latter before $z\\approx27$ and vice versa after. The\n$f_{b,h}$-$M_h$ relation is unchanged in those cases as well, suggesting that\nthe Pop III formation rate for a given $M_h$ is insensitive to the tested\napproximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 08:22:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 10:06:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 11:37:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 09:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

A new kind of torque exchange between planet\nand disk, the thermal torque, aims to slow down inward migration via the\nheating torque. The heating torque may even cause planets to migrate outwards,\nif the planetary luminosity is large enough. Here, we study the influence on\nplanetary migration of the thermal torque on top of previous type I models. We\nfind that the formula of Paardekooper et al. (2011) allows for more outward\nmigration than that of Jim\\'enez & Masset (2017) in most configurations, but we\nalso find that planets evolve to very similar mass and final orbital radius\nusing both formulae in a single planet-formation scenario, including pebble and\ngas accretion. Adding the thermal torque can introduce new, but small, regions\nof outwards migration if the accretion rates onto the planet correspond to\ntypical solid accretion rates following the pebble accretion scenario. If the\naccretion rates onto the planets become very large, as could be the case in\nenvironments with large pebble fluxes (e.g., high-metallicity environments),\nthe thermal torque can allow more efficient outward migration. However, even\nthen, the changes for the final mass and orbital positions in our planet\nformation scenario are quite small. This implies that for single planet\nevolution scenarios, the influence of the heating torque is probably\nnegligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 08:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

Examples include the scaled relative anisotropy (sRA), the gamma variate\nanisotropy index (GV), the surface anisotropy (UAsurf), and the lattice index\n(LI). With the advent of multidimensional diffusion encoding it became possible\nto determine the presence of microscopic diffusion anisotropy in a voxel, which\nis theoretically independent of orientation coherence. In accordance with DTI,\nthe microscopic anisotropy is typically quantified by the microscopic\nfractional anisotropy (uFA). In this work, in addition to the uFA, the four\nmicroscopic diffusion anisotropy indices (uDAIs) usRA, uGV, uUAsurf, and uLI\nare defined in analogy to the respective DAIs by means of the average diffusion\ntensor and the covariance tensor. Simulations with three representative\ndistributions of microscopic diffusion tensors revealed distinct CNR\ndifferences when differentiating between isotropic and microscopically\nanisotropic diffusion. q-Space trajectory imaging (QTI) was employed to acquire\nbrain in-vivo maps of all indices. For this purpose, a 15 min protocol\nfeaturing linear, planar, and spherical tensor encoding was used. The resulting\nmaps were of good quality and exhibited different contrasts, e.g. between gray\nand white matter. This indicates that it may be beneficial to use more than one\nuDAI in future investigational studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 09:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-03"}

These deterministic continuum models are usually\ndefined on the basis of population-scale phenomenological assumptions and\ncannot capture adaptive phenomena that are driven by stochastic variability in\nthe evolutionary paths of single individuals. In this paper, we develop a\nstochastic individual-based model for the coevolution between two competing\nphenotype-structured cell populations that are exposed to time-varying nutrient\nlevels and undergo spontaneous, heritable phenotypic variations with different\nprobabilities. The evolution of every cell is described by a set of rules that\nresult in a discrete-time branching random walk on the space of phenotypic\nstates. We formally show that the deterministic continuum counterpart of this\nmodel comprises a system of non-local partial differential equations for the\ncell population density functions coupled with an ordinary differential\nequation for the nutrient concentration. We compare the individual-based model\nand its continuum analogue, focussing on scenarios whereby the predictions of\nthe two models differ. Our results clarify the conditions under which\nsignificant differences between the two models can emerge due to stochastic\neffects associated with small population levels. These differences arise in the\npresence of low probabilities of phenotypic variation, and become more apparent\nwhen the two populations are characterised by less fit initial mean phenotypes\nand smaller initial levels of phenotypic heterogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 10:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

We aim to study G23.657-00.127,\nwhich has a nearly circular ring of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers, and is the\nmost suitable target to test hypotheses on the origin of the maser rings. The\nEuropean Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network (EVN) was used at three\nepochs spanning 10.3 yr to derive the spatio-kinematical structure of the 6.7\nGHz methanol maser emission in the target. The maser cloudlets, lying in a\nnearly symmetric ring, expand mainly in the radial direction with a mean\nvelocity of 3.2 km s$^{-1}$. There is an indication that the radial component\nof the velocity increases with cloudlet's distance from the ring centre. The\ntangential component does not show any clear evidence for rotation of the\ncloudlets or any relationship with distance from the ring centre. The\nblue-shifted masers may hint at an anticlockwise rotation of cloudlets in the\nsouthern part of the ring. The nearly circular structure of the ring clearly\npersisted for more than 10 yr. Interferometric data demonstrated that about one\nquarter of cloudlets show significant variability in their brightness, although\nthe overall spectrum was non-variable in single-dish studies. Taking into\naccount the three-dimensional motion of the maser cloudlets and their spatial\ndistribution along a small ring, we speculate about two possible scenarios\nwhere the methanol masers trace either a spherical outflow arising from an\n(almost) edge-on disc, or a wide angle wind at the base of a protostellar jet.\nThe latter is associated with near- and mid-infrared emission detected towards\nthe ring.

To work around these\nissues we employ a linear calibration approach that allows us to utilise\nmultiple data sources -- combining fine resolution data for which the Tc is\nunknown with coarse resolution data where it is known. The hybrid data set\nconstructed enables us to explore the trends in Tc with the apical and in-plane\ncopper-oxygen distances. We show that large regions of the materials space have\nyet to be explored and highlight how novel experiments relying on\nnano-engineering of the crystal structure may enable us to explore such new\nregions. Based on the trends identified we propose that single layer Bi-based\ncuprates are good candidate systems for such experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 10:33:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 15:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

Neuroscientific evidence for neuronal sequences has been reported in\ndomains as diverse as perception, motor control, speech, spatial navigation and\nmemory. Consequently, different dynamical principles have been proposed as\npossible sequence-generating mechanisms. Combining experimental findings with\ncomputational concepts like the Bayesian brain hypothesis and predictive coding\nleads to the interesting possibility that predictive and inferential processes\nin the brain are grounded on generative processes which maintain a sequential\nstructure. While probabilistic inference about ongoing sequences is a useful\ncomputational model for both the analysis of neuroscientific data and a wide\nrange of problems in artificial recognition and motor control, research on the\nsubject is relatively scarce and distributed over different fields in the\nneurosciences. Here we review key findings about neuronal sequences and relate\nthese to the concept of online inference on sequences as a model of\nsensory-motor processing and recognition. We propose that describing sequential\nneuronal activity as an expression of probabilistic inference over sequences\nmay lead to novel perspectives on brain function. Importantly, it is promising\nto translate the key idea of probabilistic inference on sequences to machine\nlearning, in order to address challenges in the real-time recognition of speech\nand human motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 10:52:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-03"}

This\ndemonstrates that the island of inversion around $N=20$ includes $^{28}$F, and\nmost probably $^{29}$F, and suggests that $^{28}$O is not doubly magic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 11:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Based on the residues between observed data and corresponding\ncalculations, the statistical and systematic uncertainties are decomposed from\nthe total uncertainty, from which one can clarify the effects from the shell\nstructure, pairing, and angular momentum change on describing $\\alpha$ decay\nhalf-life. If $N > 126$ and $N \\leqslant 126$ nuclei are considered together,\nthe systematic uncertainty of residues between observed and predicted\nhalf-lives are larger than if those groups are considered separately. Without\nshell correction term, a much larger systematic uncertainty is found if\nparameters obtained for $N \\leqslant 126$ nuclei are used to describe the\nhalf-lives of $N > 126$ nuclei. A global hindrance on the $\\alpha$ decay\nprocess is found in oA\\_nc (oA\\_c) nuclei comparing with ee (oA\\_nc) nuclei. If\nparameters obtained from ee (oA\\_nc) nuclei are used, the half-lives of oA\\_nc\n(oA\\_c) nuclei are generally underestimated with large systematic\nuncertainties, which can be related to the contribution of pairing effect and\nangular momentum. The recently observed superallowed decay from $^{104}$Te to\n$^{100}$Sn is also discussed based on uncertainty analysis.

This equation has a broad\nrange of applications in nonlinear physics, including nonlinear optics,\nspatiotemporal patterns formation, plasma dynamics, and Bose-Einstein\ncondensates. We demonstrate that careful control of dissipative and\nnon-dissipative physical mechanisms results in the self-emergence of stable\n(2+1)-dimensional dissipative solitons. Achieving such a regime does not\nrequire the presence of any additional dissipative nonlinearities, such a\nmode-locker in a laser, or inelastic scattering in a Bose-Einstein condensate.\nOur method allows for stable energy (or \"mass\") harvesting by coherent\nlocalized structures, such as ultrashort laser pulses or Bose-Einstein\ncondensates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 13:41:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 10:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

Previous studies mainly model passenger flow\nas time series by aggregating individual trips and then perform forecasting\nbased on the values in the past several steps. However, this approach\nessentially overlooks the fact that passenger flow consists of trips from each\nindividual traveler. For example, a traveler's work trip in the morning can\nhelp predict his/her home trip in the evening, while this causal structure\ncannot be explicitly encoded in standard time series models. In this paper, we\npropose a new forecasting framework for boarding flow by incorporating the\ngenerative mechanism into standard time series models and leveraging the strong\nregularity rooted in travel behavior. In doing so, we introduce returning flow\nfrom previous alighting trips as a new covariate, which captures the causal\nstructure and long-range dependencies in passenger flow data based on travel\nbehavior. We develop the return probability parallelogram (RPP) to summarize\nthe causal relationships and estimate the return flow. The proposed framework\nis evaluated using real-world passenger flow data, and the results confirm that\nthe returning flow -- a single covariate -- can substantially and consistently\nimprove various forecasting tasks, including one-step ahead forecasting,\nmulti-step ahead forecasting, and forecasting under special events. And the\nproposed method is more effective for business-type stations with most\npassengers come and return within the same day. This study can be extended to\nother modes of transport, and it also sheds new light on general demand time\nseries forecasting problems, in which causal structure and long-range\ndependencies are generated by the user behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 13:46:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 20:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

The construction of a quantitative model\non how and why these folds appear is the first step in understanding the cause\nof these conditions. In recent years, there have been various attempts to\nunderstand and model the mechanisms of brain folding. Previous works have shown\nthat mechanical instabilities play a crucial role in the formation of brain\nfolds, and that the geometry of the fetal brain is one of the main factors in\ndictating the folding characteristics. However, modeling higher-order folding,\none of the main characteristics of the human brain, has not been fully tackled.\nThe effects of thickness inhomogeneity in the gyrogenesis of the mammalian\nbrain are studied through finite-element simulations of rectangular slabs. The\nslabs are divided into two distinct regions, where the outer layer mimics the\ngray matter, and the inner layer the underlying white matter. Differential\ngrowth is introduced by only growing the top layer. The brain tissue is modeled\nas a neo-Hookean hyperelastic material.

The homogeneous cortex is\nshown to fold into a single wavelength, as common for bilayered materials,\nwhile the inhomogeneous cortex folds into more complex conformations: In their\nearly stages of development, structures reminiscent of the deep sulci in the\nbrain are obtained. As the cortex continues to develop, secondary undulations,\nwhich are shallower and more variable than the structures obtained in earlier\ngyrification stage emerge, reproducing well-known characteristics of\nhigher-order folding in the mammalian, and particularly the human, brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 14:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-03"}

Turbulence\nlifetimes, the likelihood that turbulence is sustained, is investigated for\ntransitional flows with various slip lengths. Slip surfaces decrease the\nlikelihood of sustained turbulence compared to the no-slip case, and likelihood\nis further decreased as slip length is increased. A deterministic analysis of\nthe effects of slip surfaces on transition to turbulence is performed using\nnonlinear traveling wave solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, also known\nas exact coherent solutions. Two solution families, dubbed P3 and P4, are used\nsince their lower-branch solutions are embedded on the boundary of the basin of\nattraction of laminar and turbulent flows (Park & Graham 2015). Additionally,\nthey exhibit distinct flow structures -- the P3 and P4 are denoted as core mode\nand critical layer mode, respectively. Distinct effects of slip surfaces on the\nsolutions are observed by the skin friction evolution, linear growth rate, and\nphase-space projection of transitional trajectories. The slip surface modifies\ntransition dynamics little for the core mode, but considerably for the critical\nlayer mode. Most importantly, the slip surface promotes different transition\ndynamics -- early and bypass-like transition for the core mode and delayed and\nH-/K-type-like transition for the critical layer mode. Based on spatiotemporal\nand quadrant analyses, it is found that slip surfaces promote the prevalence of\nstrong wall-toward motions (sweep-like events) near vortex cores close to the\nchannel centre, inducing an early transition, while sustained ejection events\nare present in the region of the ${\\Lambda}$-shaped vortex cores close to the\ncritical layer, resulting in a delayed transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 14:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

It is found experimentally that a zone of randomly\nfailed struts develops ahead of the primary crack tip, and is comparable in\nsize to that of the plastic zone. Hence, a crack tip J-field is absent at the\ninitiation of crack growth from the primary crack tip. This implies that the\nmeasured J_IC value and the J versus crack extension Da curve cannot be treated\nas material properties despite the fact that the specimen size meets the usual\ncriteria for J validity. The toughness tests were performed on a single-edge\nnotched bend specimen, and crack extension was measured by the direct current\npotential drop method, by digital image correlation and by X-ray computed\ntomography. The crack growth resistance of the foam is associated with two\ndistinct zones of plastic dissipation: (i) a bulk plastic zone emanating from\nthe crack tip (containing a cluster of randomly failed struts), and (ii) a\ncrack bridging zone behind the advancing crack tip. The applicability of a\ncohesive zone model to predict the fracture response is explored for the\nobserved case of large scale bridging. To do so, FE simulations are performed\nby replacing the discrete lattice of the open-cell metallic foam by a\ncompressible, elastic-plastic hardening solid while the fracture process zone\nin the foam is represented by a cohesive zone, as characterised by a tensile\ntraction versus separation law.

In order to simulate energy dissipation during the rocking motion\nHilber-Hughes-Taylor numerical dissipative time step integration is being\nadopted. The paper also compares two types of hysteretic and viscous damping\ndevices and it shows that the viscous damping behavior is favorable when it is\nused along with a rocking block.

We evaluate the representativeness of FBDM data using the\nMann-Kendall test and emerging hot and cold spots in an anomaly analysis to\nreveal the trend, magnitude, and agglommeration of population displacement\nduring the Mendocino Complex and Woolsey fires in California, USA. Our results\nshow that the distribution of FBDM pre-crisis users fits well with the total\npopulation from different sources. Due to usage habits, the elder population is\nunderrepresented in FBDM data. During the two mega-fires in California, FBDM\ndata effectively captured the temporal change of population arising from the\nplacing and lifting of evacuation orders. Coupled with monotonic trends, the\nfall and rise of cold and hot spots of population revealed the areas with the\ngreatest population drop and potential places to house the displaced residents.\nA comparison between the Mendocino Complex and Woolsey fires indicates that a\ndensely populated region can be evacuated faster than a scarcely populated one,\npossibly due to the better access to transportation. In sparsely populated\nfire-prone areas, resources should be prioritized to move people to shelters as\nthe displaced residents do not have many alternative options, while their\ncounterparts in densely populated areas can utilize their social connections to\nseek temporary stay at nearby locations during an evacuation. Integrated with\nan assessment on underrepresented communities, FBDM data and the derivatives\ncan provide much needed information of near real-time population displacement\nfor crisis response and disaster relief.

However, the challenge till now has been that\nthere is no practical way to firmly establish if the solution to a problem is\nactually random (or whether it has some hidden undiscovered structure, which\nupon being detected would render it non-random). This has prevented the\nconclusive declaration of hard problems (such as NP) as being definitely\nintractable. For dealing with this, a concept called \"extensibility\" of a\nsequence is developed. Based on this, a criterion termed as \"cardinality of\nextended solution set\" is conceived to ascertain the (non)randomness of any\nsequence.

Despite\nrecent improvements to enable pore-network modeling on simplified pore geometry\nextracted from rock images and its computational efficiency compared to direct\nnumerical simulation methods, there are still limitations to modeling a large\nrepresentative pore-network for heterogeneous cores. These are due to the\ntechnical limits on sample size to discern void space during imaging and\ncomputational limits on pore-network extraction algorithms. Thus, there is a\nneed for pore-scale modeling approaches that have the natural advantages of\npore-network modeling and can overcome these limitations, thereby enabling\nbetter representation of heterogeneity of the core and enhancing the accuracy\nof prediction of properties. This paper addresses these issues with a workflow\nthat includes a novel pore-network stitching method to provide large-enough\nrepresentative pore-network. It uses CT images of heterogeneous cores at\ndifferent resolutions to characterize the pore structure in order to select few\nsignature parts and extract their pore-networks. The space between these\nsignature pore-networks is filled by using their statistics to generate\nrealizations of pore-networks which are then connected together using a layered\nstitching method. We validate all steps of this method on different types of\nrocks based on flow properties such as relative permeability. Then, we apply\nthe stochastic workflow on two large heterogeneous domain problems. We generate\nmultiple realizations and compare the average results with a reference\npore-network for each problem. We demonstrate that signature parts of a\nheterogeneous core, which are a small portion of its entire volume, are\nsufficient inputs for the developed method to construct a representative\npore-network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 22:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-06"}

Online\ncriminals are always finding new creative ways to trick internet users, be it\nin the form of lottery scams, downloading scam apps for smartphones or fake\ngambling websites. This paper presents a large-scale study on one particular\ndelivery method of online scam: pop-up scam on typosquatting domains.\nTyposquatting describes the concept of registering domains which are very\nsimilar to existing ones while deliberately containing common typing errors;\nthese domains are then used to trick online users while under the belief of\nbrowsing the intended website. Pop-up scam uses JavaScript alert boxes to\npresent a message which attracts the user's attention very effectively, as they\nare a blocking user interface element.\n  Our study among typosquatting domains derived from the Majestic Million list\nutilising an Austrian IP address revealed on 1219 distinct typosquatting URLs a\ntotal of 2577 pop-up messages, out of which 1538 were malicious. Approximately\na third of those distinct URLs (403) were targeted and displayed pop-up\nmessages to one specific HTTP user agent only. Based on our scans, we present\nan in-depth analysis as well as a detailed classification of different\ntargeting parameters (user agent and language) which triggered varying kinds of\npop-up scams. Furthermore, we expound the differences of current pop-up scam\ncharacteristics in comparison with a previous scan performed in late 2018 and\nexamine the use of IDN homograph attacks as well as the application of message\nlocalisation using additional scans with IP addresses from the United States\nand Japan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 09:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

Alignments are an established technique to compute the distance\nbetween a trace in the event log and the closest execution trace of a\ncorresponding process model. Given a cost function, an alignment is optimal\nwhen it contains the least number of mismatches between a log trace and a model\ntrace. Determining optimal alignments, however, is computationally expensive,\nespecially in light of the growing size and complexity of event logs from\npractice, which can easily exceed one million events with traces of several\nhundred activities. A common limitation of existing alignment techniques is the\ninability to exploit repetitions in the log. By exploiting a specific form of\nsequential pattern in traces, namely tandem repeats, we propose a novel\napproximate technique that uses pre- and post-processing steps to compress the\nlength of a trace and recomputes the alignment cost while guaranteeing that the\ncost result never under-approximates the optimal cost.

EEG from 8 occipital sites is recorded with\n2000 samples/sec per channel, in response to visual stimuli presented on a\ncomputer monitor with 60Hz refresh rate. Onset and offset EEG responses to long\nvisual stimulus pulses are obtained through 160-trial signal averaging. These\nedge responses are used to predict the EEG responses to arbitrary stimulus\nsequences using the superposition principle. A BCI speller which utilizes the\ntarget templates generated by this principle is also implemented and tested. It\nis found that certain short stimulus patterns can be accurately predicted by\nthe superposition principle. BCI sequences that are constructed by combinations\nof these optimal patterns yield higher accuracy (95.9%) and ITR (57.2 bpm)\ncompared to when the superposition principle is applied to conventional\nm-sequences and randomly generated sequences. Training time for the BCI\napplication involves only the acquisition of the edge responses and is less\nthan 4 minutes, and a huge number of sequences is possible.
