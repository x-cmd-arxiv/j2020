Channel feedback is essential in frequency division duplex (FDD)\nRIS-assisted wireless communications, since the downlink channel state\ninformation (CSI) needs to be acquired by the base station (BS) from the user\nequipment (UE) for the joint beamforming at the BS and the RIS. In this paper,\nwe exploit the single-structured sparsity of RIS channel, which means that the\nsparse angular-domain channels of different users share the same structured\nsparsity only in the column dimension, but not in the row dimension. Based on\nthis characteristic, we propose a dimension reduced channel feedback scheme\nwith the low overhead. Specifically, the downlink CSI can be expressed with the\nstructured information and unstructured information. The structured information\nof the multi-user channels can be fed back to the BS only by one user according\nto the single-structured sparsity, then the unstructured information can be fed\nback with a fairly low overhead by different users, respectively. Moreover, by\nutilizing the angle coherence time, the per-user overhead can be reduced\nfurther, while the near-optimal performance can still be guaranteed. Simulation\nresults show that, the proposed scheme can reduce the channel feedback overhead\nby 80% compared to the conventional method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 16:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

Solving the $\\ell^1$-synthesis basis pursuit allows for a simultaneous\nestimation of a coefficient representation as well as the sought-for signal.\nHowever, due to linear dependencies within redundant dictionary atoms it might\nbe impossible to identify a specific representation vector, although the actual\nsignal is still successfully recovered. The present manuscript studies both\nestimation problems from a non-uniform, signal-dependent perspective. By\nutilizing recent results on the convex geometry of linear inverse problems, the\nsampling rates describing the phase transitions of each formulation are\nidentified. In both cases, they are given by the conic Gaussian mean width of\nan $\\ell^1$-descent cone that is linearly transformed by the dictionary. In\ngeneral, this expression does not allow a simple calculation by following the\npolarity-based approach commonly found in the literature. Hence, two upper\nbounds involving the sparsity of coefficient representations are provided: The\nfirst one is based on a local condition number and the second one on a\ngeometric analysis that makes use of the thinness of high-dimensional\npolyhedral cones with not too many generators. It is furthermore revealed that\nboth recovery problems can differ dramatically with respect to robustness to\nmeasurement noise -- a fact that seems to have gone unnoticed in most of the\nrelated literature.

However, in reality, logs may contain some \"noise\" that could\ndeteriorate the performance of model inference. One form of noise can commonly\nbe found in system logs that contain not only transactional messages---logging\nthe functional behavior of the system---but also operational\nmessages---recording the operational state of the system (e.g., a periodic\nheartbeat to keep track of the memory usage). In low-quality logs,\ntransactional and operational messages are randomly interleaved, leading to the\nerroneous inclusion of operational behaviors into a system model, that ideally\nshould only reflect the functional behavior of the system. It is therefore\nimportant to remove operational messages in the logs before inferring models.\nIn this paper, we propose LogCleaner, a novel technique for removing\noperational logs messages. LogCleaner first performs a periodicity analysis to\nfilter out periodic messages, and then it performs a dependency analysis to\ncalculate the degree of dependency for all log messages and to remove\noperational messages based on their dependencies. The experimental results on\ntwo proprietary and 11 publicly available log datasets show that LogCleaner, on\naverage, can accurately remove 98% of the operational messages and preserve 81%\nof the transactional messages. Furthermore, using logs pre-processed with\nLogCleaner decreases the execution time of model inference (with a speed-up\nranging from 1.5 to 946.7 depending on the characteristics of the system) and\nsignificantly improves the accuracy of the inferred models, by increasing their\nability to accept correct system behaviors (+43.8 pp on average, with\npp=percentage points) and to reject incorrect system behaviors (+15.0 pp on\naverage).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 16:49:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 16:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

Taking the example of data from New York City, we\nshow that currently used models significantly underestimate the initial basic\nreproduction number ($R_0$). The correct description, based on integral\nequations, can be implemented in most of the reported models and it much more\naccurately accounts for the dynamics of the epidemic after sharp changes in\n$R_0$ due to restrictive public congregation measures. It also provides a novel\nway to determine the incubation period, and most importantly, as we demonstrate\nfor several countries, this method allows an accurate monitoring of $R_0$ and\nthus a fine-tuning of any restrictive measures.

Selection criteria were derived to remove\nspurious and unresolved instability modes that arise from the eigenvalue\nproblem and we generalize the study of the hydrostatic Eady problem by Heifetz\nand Farrell (2003, 2007, 2008) to thin fronts, characterized by large aspect\nratios.

To design a private system, first private\nalgorithms must be designed that can quantify the privacy loss of each outcome\nthat is released. However, private algorithms that inject noise into the\ncomputation are not sufficient to ensure individuals' data is protected due to\nmany noisy results ultimately concentrating to the true, non-privatized result.\nHence there have been several works providing precise formulas for how the\nprivacy loss accumulates over multiple interactions with private algorithms.\nHowever, these formulas either provide very general bounds on the privacy loss,\nat the cost of being overly pessimistic for certain types of private\nalgorithms, or they can be too narrow in scope to apply to general privacy\nsystems. In this work, we unify existing privacy loss composition bounds for\nspecial classes of differentially private (DP) algorithms along with general DP\ncomposition bounds. In particular, we provide strong privacy loss bounds when\nan analyst may select pure DP, bounded range (e.g. exponential mechanisms), or\nconcentrated DP mechanisms in any order.

Moreover, many\nmanifestations of severe CoViD-19, such as severe lung injury, exacerbated\ninflammatory response and thrombotic problems may derive from increased\nAngiotensin II (Ang-II) level that results from degradation of ACE2 by the\nvirus.

In this study, the\ndirectional senstivity is enhanced via sinusoidally shaping the fibre that is\nembedded in a polyurethane strip. First, the directional senstivity is\nquantified via a relatively simple analytical model. Second, static-strain\nmeasurements using a Brillouin Optical Frequency Domain Analysis (BOFDA) system\nare carried out on a physical sample of the strip. Two different directions are\nexamined, namely in-line and broadside orientations. The former involves\ndeforming parallel to the plane where the fibre is sinusoidally embedded,\nwhereas the latter means deforming the plane normal to it. It can be observed\nthat the response to the deformation in these orientations is opposite, i.e.\nthe fibre experiences negative strain, so shortening, an in-line deformation,\nand a positive strain, so stretching, for a broadside deformation. It can be\nfound that the fibre is slightly more senstive in the in-line direction which\nagrees with the behaviour as predicted by the model. Also, we see that the\nmeasured strain along the optical fibre is mainly influenced by the elastic\nproperties of the embedding material due to, most importantly, the Poisson's\nratio as well as the geometrical parameters of the sinusoidally shaped fibre.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 18:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

The conventional procedure of measuring a high-weight operator\nrequires multiple pairwise unitary operations, which can be slow and prone to\nerrors. We provide an alternative method to passively detect the value of a\nhigh-weight operator using only two-local interactions and single-qubit\ncontinuous measurements. This approach involves joint interactions between the\nsystem and continuously-monitored ancillary qubits. The measurement outcomes\nfrom the monitor qubits reveal information about the value of the operator.\nThis information can be retrieved by using a numerical estimator or by\nevaluating the time average of the signals. The interaction Hamiltonian can be\neffectively built using only two-local operators, based on techniques from\nperturbation theory. We apply this indirect detection scheme to the four-qubit\nBacon-Shor code, where the two stabilizers are indirectly monitored using four\nancillary qubits. Due to the fact that the four-qubit Bacon-Shor code is an\nerror-detecting code and that the Quantum Zeno Effect can suppress errors, we\nalso study the error suppression under the indirect measurement process. In\nthis example, we show that various types of non-Markovian errors can be\nsuppressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 18:39:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 01:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

We extend this method to our novel Set-query LSH (SLSH), such that it\ncan find the nearest neighbors of a set of points, given as a query.\n  Let $ s(x,y) $ be the similarity between two points $ x $ and $ y $. We\ndefine a similarity between a set $ Q$ and a point $ x $ by aggregating the\nsimilarities $ s(p,x) $ for all $ p\\in Q $. For example, we can take $ s(p,x) $\nto be the angular similarity between $ p $ and $ x $ (i.e., $1-{\\angle\n(x,p)}/{\\pi}$), and aggregate by arithmetic or geometric averaging, or taking\nthe lowest similarity.\n  We develop locality sensitive hash families and data structures for a large\nset of such arithmetic and geometric averaging similarities, and analyze their\ncollision probabilities. We also establish an analogous framework and hash\nfamilies for distance functions. Specifically, we give a structure for the\neuclidean distance aggregated by either averaging or taking the maximum.\n  We leverage SLSH to solve a geometric extension of the approximate near\nneighbors problem.

This concept has not been explored to\ndate in the realm of musical scores as these are typically short sequences\nwhose time reversibility estimation could suffer from strong finite size\neffects which preclude interpretability. Here we show that the so-called\nHorizontal Visibility Graph method -- which recently was shown to quantify such\nstatistical property even in non-stationary signals -- is a method that can\nestimate time reversibility of short symbolic sequences, thus unlocking the\npossibility of exploring such properties in the context of musical\ncompositions. Accordingly, we analyse over 8000 musical pieces ranging from the\nRenaissance to the early Modern period and certify that, indeed, most of them\ndisplay clear signatures of time irreversibility. Since by construction\nstochastic processes with a linear correlation structure (such as 1/f noise)\nare time reversible, we conclude that musical compositions have a considerably\nricher structure, that goes beyond the traditional properties retrieved by the\npower spectrum or similar approaches. We also show that musical compositions\ndisplay strong signs of nonlinear correlations, that nonlinearity is correlated\nto irreversibility, and that these are also related to asymmetries in the\nabundance of musical intervals, which we associate to the narrative\nunderpinning a musical composition. These findings provide tools for the study\nof musical periods and composers, as well as criteria related to music\nappreciation and cognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 19:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

So far, no scalable method is\nperforming better than the simple yet effective mixed-finetuning, i.e\nfinetuning a generic model with a mix of all specialized data and generic data.\nIn this paper, we propose a new training pipeline where knowledge distillation\nand multiple specialized teachers allow us to efficiently finetune a model\nwithout adding new costs at inference time. Our experiments demonstrated that\nour training pipeline allows improving the performance of multi-domain\ntranslation over finetuning in configurations with 2, 3, and 4 domains by up to\n2 points in BLEU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 20:21:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

Capturing richer and more comprehensive information about drug-drug\ninteractions (DDI) is one of the key tasks in public health and drug\ndevelopment. Recently, several knowledge graph embedding approaches have\nreceived increasing attention in the DDI domain due to their capability of\nprojecting drugs and interactions into a low-dimensional feature space for\npredicting links and classifying triplets. However, existing methods only apply\na uniformly random mode to construct negative samples. As a consequence, these\nsamples are often too simplistic to train an effective model. In this paper, we\npropose a new knowledge graph embedding framework by introducing adversarial\nautoencoders (AAE) based on Wasserstein distances and Gumbel-Softmax relaxation\nfor drug-drug interactions tasks. In our framework, the autoencoder is employed\nto generate high-quality negative samples and the hidden vector of the\nautoencoder is regarded as a plausible drug candidate. Afterwards, the\ndiscriminator learns the embeddings of drugs and interactions based on both\npositive and negative triplets. Meanwhile, in order to solve vanishing gradient\nproblems on the discrete representation--an inherent flaw in traditional\ngenerative models--we utilize the Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and the Wasserstein\ndistance to train the embedding model steadily. We empirically evaluate our\nmethod on two tasks, link prediction and DDI classification.

Since the influence of magnetic\ntongues on WL tilt measurements has not been taken into account before, we aim\nto investigate their role in tilt-angle values and to compare them with those\nderived from LOS magnetograms. We apply four methods to compute the tilt angle\nof generally bipolar ARs: one applies the k-means algorithm to WL data, a\nsecond one includes the magnetic field sign of the polarities to WL data, and a\nthird one uses the magnetic flux-weighted center of each polarity. The tilt\nvalues computed in any of these ways are affected by the presence of magnetic\ntongues. Therefore, we apply the newly developed Core Field Fit Estimator\n(CoFFE) method to separate the magnetic flux in the tongues from that in the AR\ncore. We compare the four computed tilt-angle values, as well as these with the\nones reported in long-term WL databases. For ARs with low magnetic flux tongues\nthe different methods report consistent tilt-angle values. But for ARs with\nhigh flux tongues there are noticeable discrepancies between all methods\nindicating that magnetic tongues affect differently WL and magnetic data.\nHowever, in general, CoFFE achieves a better estimation of the main bipole tilt\nbecause it removes both the effect of tongues as well as the emergence of\nsecondary bipoles when it occurs in between the main bipole magnetic\npolarities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 21:16:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

In general, the quantum phase is a statement about the ground state\nand has no relation to far-from-equilibrium dynamics. Although tunneling is a\nhighly dynamical process involving many excited states, we find that the\nquantum phase of the Bose-Hubbard model determines phase-dependent tunneling\noutcomes for the quantum tunneling escape, or quasi-bound problem. Superfluid\nand Mott insulator correlations lead to a new quantum tunneling rate, the\nquantum fluctuation rate. This rate shows surprising and highly dynamical\nfeatures, such as oscillatory interference between trapped and escaped atoms\nand a completely different macroscopic quantum tunneling behavior for\nsuperfluid and Mott insulator phases. In the superfluid phase we find that\nescape dynamics are wave-like and coherent, leading to interference patterns in\nthe density with a rapid decay process which is non-exponential. Quantum\nentropy production peaks when about half the atoms have escaped. In the Mott\nphase, despite stronger repulsive interactions, tunneling is significantly\nslowed by the presence of a Mott gap, creating an effective extra barrier to\novercome. Only one atom can tunnel at a time, yet the decay process is nearly\nlinear, completely defying the single-particle exponential model.

The architecture, designed for\nscalability, relies upon (a) the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called\n'Verifiable Credentials', (b) Tim Berners-Lee's decentralized personal data\nplatform 'Solid', and (c) a Consortium Ethereum-based blockchain. Results: Our\nmobile phone app and decentralized server architecture enable the mixture of\nverifiability and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and\ndigital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive\ndigital keys and/or data. Benchmark performance tests show it to scale linearly\nin the worst case, as significant processing is done locally on each app. For\nthe test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. healthcare staff, pharmacy) and\nVerifier (e.g. employer), it is 'just another app' which takes only minutes to\nuse. Conclusions: The app and decentralized server architecture offer a\nprototype proof of concept that is readily scalable, applicable generically,\nand in effect 'waiting in the wings' for the biological issues, plus key\nethical issues raised in the discussion section, to be resolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 22:42:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 19:36:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 20:32:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2020 18:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

To\naccomplish this task, we form training pairs consisting of densely sampled data\nand artificially subsampled data using a reciprocity argument and the\nassumption that the source-site sampling is dense. While this approach has\nsuccessfully been used on the recovery monochromatic frequency slices, its\napplication in practice calls for wavefield reconstruction of time-domain data.\nDespite having the option to parallelize, the overall costs of this approach\ncan become prohibitive if we decide to carry out the training and recovery\nindependently for each frequency.

In the absence of a safe and effective\nvaccine or antiviral, strategies for mitigating the burden of the pandemic are\nfocused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing,\ncontact-tracing, quarantine, isolation and the use of face-masks in public. We\ndevelop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of\nthese mitigation strategies.

The worst-case scenario\nprojections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of\nanti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) in New\nYork State and the entire US decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%,\nrespectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are\nmaintained until the end of May or June, 2020. This study shows that early\ntermination of strict social-distancing could trigger a devastating second wave\nwith burden similar to that projected before the onset of strict\nsocial-distance. The use of efficacious face-masks (efficacy greater than 70%)\ncould lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents\nof New York state use such masks consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at\nleast 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks,\nsuch as cloth masks (of efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant\nreduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to\nelimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of other\nanti-COVID-19 intervention measures can lead to elimination of the pandemic.\nThe mask coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if mask-use is\ncombined with strict social-distancing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 23:30:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 14:24:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-27"}

We report here, the codoping of a metal\nand a nonmetal in anatase TiO$_2$ and SrTiO$_3$ for efficient photocatalytic\nwater splitting using hybrid density functional theory and \\textit{ab initio}\natomistic thermodynamics. The latter ensures to capture the environmental\neffect to understand thermodynamic stability of the charged defects at a\nrealistic condition.

Recently, novel\ncorrelated phases are predicted to appear in WSMs with long-ranged\ninteractions, in which the bulk Weyl nodes can be gapped but without destroying\ntheir topological properties. Here, we explore the fate of the Fermi-arc states\nunder the influence of such long-ranged interactions. After mapping the system\nonto a one-dimensional interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with two\nopen ends, we employ numerical exact diagonalizations to address the issue\nwhether the Fermi-arc states will be modified. By extrapolating our data to the\nthermodynamic limit, we find that the zero-energy edge states of the\ncorresponding SSH model still exist for those momenta giving the noninteracting\nFermi-arc states. Moreover, this observation applies to both the\nsingle-particle and the collective edge excitations.

However, rather than having access to the underlying distance\nmetric, we only know, for each point in $V$, a ranking of its distances to the\npoints in $C$. We propose algorithms that choose a point in $C$ using only\nthese rankings as input and we provide bounds on their \\emph{distortion}\n(worst-case approximation ratio). A prominent motivation for this problem comes\nfrom voting theory, where $V$ represents a set of voters, $C$ represents a set\nof candidates, and the rankings correspond to ordinal preferences of the\nvoters. A major conjecture in this framework is that the optimal deterministic\nalgorithm has distortion $3$. We resolve this conjecture by providing a\npolynomial-time algorithm that achieves distortion $3$, matching a known lower\nbound. We do so by proving a novel lemma about matching voters to candidates,\nwhich we refer to as the \\emph{ranking-matching lemma}. This lemma induces a\nfamily of novel algorithms, which may be of independent interest, and we show\nthat a special algorithm in this family achieves distortion $3$.

Methods: We investigate the binary trigger\nhypothesis in longer-period (>20yr) binaries by carrying out three-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of the formation of low-mass binary\nstars down to final separations of $\\sim$10$\\au$, including the effects of gas\nturbulence and magnetic fields. We ran two simulations with an initial\nturbulent gas core of one solar mass each and two different initial turbulent\nMach numbers, M = 0.1 and M=0.2, for 6500yr after protostar formation. Results:\nWe observe bursts of accretion at periastron during the early stages when the\neccentricity of the binary system is still high. We find that this correlation\nbetween bursts of accretion and passing periastron breaks down at later stages\nbecause of the gradual circularisation of the orbits. For eccentricities\ngreater than e=0.2, we observe episodic accretion triggered near periastron.\nHowever, we do not find any strong correlation between the strength of episodic\naccretion and eccentricity. The strength of accretion is defined as the ratio\nof the burst accretion rate to the quiescent accretion rate.We determine that\naccretion events are likely triggered by torques between the rotation of the\ncircumstellar disc and the approaching binary stars. We compare our results\nwith observational data of episodic accretion in short-period binaries and find\ngood agreement between our simulations and the observations. Conclusions: We\nconclude that episodic accretion is a universal mechanism operating in\neccentric young binary-star systems, independent of separation, and it should\nbe observable in long-period binaries as well as in short-period binaries.\nNevertheless, the strength depends on the torques and hence the separation at\nperiastron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 08:34:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 13:10:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

In this case, the\nend of the expansion acceleration of the $\\Lambda CDM$ phase is the beginning\nof a new inflation phase. We show that such a scenario implies the coupling of\nmatter and/or radiation to dark energy. We consider the simplest of these\n$\\Lambda CDM$ periodic models i.e. a vacuum energy coupled to radiation. From\nmatter domination phase to today, it behaves like a $\\Lambda CDM$ model, then\nfollowed by an inflation phase. But a sudden and fast decay of the dark energy\ninto radiation periodically ends the expansion acceleration. This leads to a\nradiation dominated Universe preceding a new $\\Lambda CDM$ type expansion. The\nmodel is constrained with Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations using\nsupernovae, Hubble expansion, BAO and CMB data and fits the data as well as the\n$\\Lambda CDM$ one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 09:45:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

The proposed location-specific attention selectively aggregates\nspatial logits within a target region, which leads to not only the performance\nimprovement but also spatially interpretable outputs. Moreover, the proposed\nSAOL also permits to fully exploit location-specific self-supervision as well\nas self-distillation to enhance the generalization ability during training. The\nproposed SAOL with self-supervision and self-distillation can be easily plugged\ninto existing CNNs. Experimental results on various classification tasks with\nrepresentative architectures show consistent performance improvements by SAOL\nat almost the same computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 10:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

Our dataset included images of six 87'' x\n87'' regions of the quiet Sun obtained with angular resolution of a few arcsec\nat a cadence of 2 s. The transient brightenings were detected as weak\nenhancements above the average intensity after we removed the effect of the\np-mode oscillations. A similar analysis, over the same regions, was performed\nfor simultaneous 304 and 1600 \\AA\\ data obtained with the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly. We detected 184 3 mm transient brightening events with brightness\ntemperatures from 70 K to more than 500 K above backgrounds of $\\sim 7200-7450$\nK. Their mean duration and maximum area were 51.1 s and 12.3 Mm$^2$,\nrespectively, with a weak preference of appearing at network boundaries rather\nthan in cell interiors. Both parameters exhibited power-law behavior with\nindices of 2.35 and 2.71, respectively.

In these systems, PBC is used as a common database shared between\nsupply chain parties to secure the integrity and reliability of distribution\ninformation such as ownership transfer records. Thus, these systems secure a\nhigh level of traceability in the supply chain. However, the distribution\ninformation, which can be private information, is made public since the\ninformation recorded in PBC can be read by anyone. In this paper, we propose a\nmethod for preserving privacy while securing traceability in a supply chain\nsystem using PBC. The proposed method preserves privacy by concealing the\ndistribution information via encryption. In addition, the proposed method\nensures distribution among legitimate supply chain parties while concealing\ntheir blockchain address by using a zero-knowledge proof to prove their\nauthenticity. We implement the proposed method on Ethereum smart contracts and\nevaluate cost performance based on transaction fees.

Evaluating such interventions would\ngenerally require access to an elaborate simulator, which must be constructed\nad-hoc for each environment, and can be prohibitively costly or inaccurate.\nHere we examine a simple alternative: Optimize By Observational Extrapolation\n(OBOE). The idea is to use observed behavioural trajectories, without any\ninterventions, to learn predictive models mapping environment states to\nindividual agent outcomes, and then use these to evaluate and select changes.\nWe evaluate OBOE in socially complex gridworld environments and consider novel\nphysical interventions that our models were not trained on. We show that neural\nnetwork models trained to predict agent returns on baseline environments are\neffective at selecting among the interventions. Thus, OBOE can provide guidance\nfor challenging questions like: \"which wall should I tear down in order to\nminimize the Gini index of this group?\"\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 12:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

Although the hydrodynamics at the nanoscale is subject of intense\nresearch and despite the enormous interest in the non-Markovian dynamics of\nsingle molecules and solutes, the onset of friction from the atomistic scale so\nfar could not be demonstrated. Here, we fill this gap based on\nfrequency-resolved friction data from high-precision simulations of three\nprototypical liquids, including water. Combining with rigorous theoretical\narguments, we show that friction in liquids emerges abruptly at a\ncharacteristic frequency, beyond which viscous liquids appear as\nnon-dissipative, elastic solids; as a consequence, its origin is non-local in\ntime. Concomitantly, the molecules experience Brownian forces that display\npersistent correlations and long-lasting memory. A critical test of the\ngeneralised Stokes-Einstein relation, mapping the friction of single molecules\nto the viscoelastic response of the macroscopic sample, disproves the relation\nfor Newtonian fluids, but substantiates it exemplarily for water and a\nmoderately supercooled liquid.

Notable among\nthem are quantum impurity models, which appear in various nanoelectronic and\nquantum computing applications. Despite their seeming simplicity, they feature\ncorrelated phenomena, including emergent energy scales and non-Fermi-liquid\nphysics, requiring renormalization group treatment. This has typically been at\nodds with the description of their nonequilibrium steady-state under finite\nbias, which exposes their nature as open quantum systems. We present a novel\nnumerically-exact method for obtaining the nonequilibrium state of a general\nquantum impurity coupled to metallic leads at arbitrary voltage or temperature\nbias, which we call \"RL-NESS\" (Renormalized Lindblad-driven NonEquilibrium\nSteady-State). It is based on coherently coupling the impurity to discretized\nleads which are treated exactly. These leads are furthermore weakly coupled to\nreservoirs described by Lindblad dynamics which impose voltage or temperature\nbias. Going beyond previous attempts, we exploit a hybrid discretization scheme\nfor the leads together with Wilson's numerical renormalization group, in order\nto probe exponentially small energy scales. The steady-state is then found by\nevolving a matrix-product density operator via real-time Lindblad dynamics,\nemploying a dissipative generalization of the time-dependent density matrix\nrenormalization group. In the long-time limit, this procedure converges to the\nsteady-state at finite bond dimension due to the introduced dissipation, which\nbounds the growth of entanglement.

When\nfocusing on low-cost, large scale products for automated driving, model-driven\napproaches for the detection of lane markings have proven good performance.\nMore recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed that target the\ndrivable area / freespace mainly in inner-city applications. Focus of these\napproaches is less on lane-based driving due to the fact that the lane concept\ndoes not fully apply in unstructured, residential inner-city environments.\nSo-far the concept of drivable area is seldom used for highway and inter-urban\napplications due to the specific requirements of these scenarios that require\nclear lane associations of all traffic participants.

We then propose to predict the best parser at\nthe instance level. To this end, we train a supervised regression model, based\non the Transformer architecture, to predict parser accuracies for individual\nPOS-sequences. We compare ILPS against two strong single-best parser selection\nbaselines (SBPS): (1) a model that compares POS n-gram distributions between\nthe source and target languages (KL) and (2) a model that selects the source\nbased on the similarity between manually created language vectors encoding\nsyntactic properties of languages (L2V). The results from our extensive\nevaluation, coupling 42 source parsers and 20 diverse low-resource test\nlanguages, show that ILPS outperforms KL and L2V on 13/20 and 14/20 test\nlanguages, respectively. Further, we show that by predicting the best parser\n\"at the treebank level\" (SBPS), using the aggregation of predictions from our\ninstance-level model, we outperform the same baselines on 17/20 and 16/20 test\nlanguages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 13:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

If the magnetic field is applied along a generic\ndirection, cubic anisotropy terms act as an effective spin-orbit interaction\nintroducing novel exchange couplings even for an inversion symmetric setup.\nConsidering the example of a silicon nanowire double dot, we present the\nrelative strength of these anisotropic exchange interaction terms and calculate\nthe fidelity of the $\\sqrt{\\text{SWAP}}$ gate. Furthermore, we show that the\nanisotropy-induced spin-orbit effects can be comparable to that of the direct\nRashba spin-orbit interaction for experimentally feasible electric field\nstrengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 13:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

Thin films of liquid result in increased\nheat transfer due to a reduction of conduction resistance, in addition the\npressure jump at the liquid-vapor interface also affects the rate and direction\nof rate of phase change. Because of these effects the morphology of the\nsubstrate surface is expected to affect the film shape, hence heat transfer,\nespecially in thin films. In this study, the influence of surface\ncharacteristics on the rate of phase change from micron and sub-micron sized\n2-D droplets-i.e. films extending to infinity-forming on a substrate are\nmodeled. Surface film profiles are generated on both flat and non-flat\nsurfaces, triangular or wavy in nature, and a kinetic model for\nquasi-equilibrium phase change is applied. Due to the presence of\nintermolecular forces at the contact line, which render the solution of the\naugmented Young-Laplace equation stiff, an implicit scheme is employed for the\nnumerical integration. To verify the method, the predictions of a molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulation of a nano sized droplet present on a V-grooved surface\nis compared to the continuum model. The augmented Young-Laplace equation is\nsolved numerically along with a phase change model originating from kinetic\ntheory to calculate the shape of the two-phase interface forming the droplet\nand study the effect of various parameters on the rate of phase change. Results\nare obtained for droplets with liquid pressures higher and lower than that of\nvapor, resulting in opposite contribution to phase change due to the pressure\njump at the interface. The results show that the heat transfer rate can be\nsubstantially altered due primarily to the combined effects of surface\nmorphology and disjoining pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 13:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

The first one constitutes a more naive approach that assumes that\nthe true parameters are known. The second objective incorporates the knowledge\nof the underlying dynamics and is therefore considered as hybrid approach. We\nshow that in terms of robustness, the latter outperforms the first objective on\nnoisy input data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

Three essential\ningredients are identified: 1) a material density variable $\\gamma$ that is as\nneutral as feasible; 2) a material state function $\\xi$ independent of\n$\\gamma$, but otherwise arbitrary; 3) an empirically determined reference\nfunction $\\xi_r(\\gamma)$ of $\\gamma$ representing the imagined behaviour of\n$\\xi$ in a notional spiceless ocean. Ingredient 1) is required because contrary\nto what is often assumed, it is not the properties imposed on $\\xi$ (such as\northogonality) that determine its dynamical inertness but the degree of\nneutrality of $\\gamma$. The first key result is that it is the anomaly $\\xi' =\n\\xi - \\xi_r(\\gamma)$, rather than $\\xi$, that is the variable the most suited\nfor characterising ocean water masses, as originally proposed by McDougall and\nGiles (1987). The second key result is that oceanic sections of normalised\n$\\xi'$ appear to be relatively insensitive to the choice of $\\xi$, as first\nsuggested by Jackett and McDougall (1985). It is also argued that orthogonality\nof $\\nabla \\xi'$ to $\\nabla \\gamma$ in physical space is more germane to\nspiciness theory than orthogonality in thermohaline space, although how to use\nit to constrain the choices of $\\xi$ and $\\xi_r(\\gamma)$ remains to be fully\nelucidated. The results are important for they unify the various ways in which\nspiciness has been defined and used in the literature. They also provide a\nrigorous theoretical basis justifying the pursuit of a globally defined\nmaterial density variable maximising neutrality. To illustrate the latter\npoint, this paper proposes a new implementation of the author's recently\ndeveloped thermodynamic neutral density and explains how to adapt existing\ndefinitions of spiciness/spicity to work with it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:07:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 11:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Accurate estimation of potentially\ninteresting cycles within such series seems beyond reach. We solve the problem\nof obtaining accurate estimates from short time series by using recent Bayesian\nspectral fusion methods. Here we show that transformed new daily COVID-19 cases\nfor many countries generally contain three cycles operating at wavelengths of\naround 2.7, 4.1 and 6.7 days (weekly). We show that the shorter cycles are\nsuppressed after lockdown. The pre- and post lockdown differences suggest that\nthe weekly effect is at least partly due to non-epidemic factors, whereas the\ntwo shorter cycles seem intrinsic to the epidemic. Unconstrained, new cases\ngrow exponentially, but the internal cyclic structure causes periodic falls in\ncases. This suggests that lockdown success might only be indicated by four or\nmore daily falls in cases. Spectral learning for epidemic time series\ncontributes to the understanding of the epidemic process, helping evaluate\ninterventions and assists with forecasting. Spectral fusion is a general\ntechnique that is able to fuse spectra recorded at different sampling rates,\nwhich can be applied to a wide range of time series from many disciplines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:09:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

Despite\ndecades of research into the subject, it is still challenging to tackle the\nrobot locomotion problem from an algorithmic point of view. For example, these\nmachines cannot achieve a constant forward body movement without exploiting\ncontacts with the environment. The reactive forces resulting from the contacts\nare subject to strong limitations, complicating the design of control laws. As\na consequence, the generation of humanoid motions requires to exploit fully the\nmathematical model of the robot in contact with the environment or to resort to\napproximations of it.\n  This thesis investigates predictive and optimal control techniques for\ntackling humanoid robot motion tasks. They generate control input values from\nthe system model and objectives, often transposed as cost function to minimize.\nIn particular, this thesis tackles several aspects of the humanoid robot\nlocomotion problem in a crescendo of complexity. First, we consider the single\nstep push recovery problem. Namely, we aim at maintaining the upright posture\nwith a single step after a strong external disturbance. Second, we generate and\nstabilize walking motions. In addition, we adopt predictive techniques to\nperform more dynamic motions, like large step-ups.\n  The above-mentioned applications make use of different simplifications or\nassumptions to facilitate the tractability of the corresponding motion tasks.\nMoreover, they consider first the foot placements and only afterward how to\nmaintain balance.

Training a universal model that works\nanywhere, anytime, for anybody is unrealistic. In this work, we demonstrate the\ngeneralizability problem, then explore potential solutions based on transfer\nlearning (TL) by using the cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) to computed\ntomography (CT) image conversion task as the testbed. Previous works have\nconverted CBCT to CT-like images. However, all of those works studied only one\nor two anatomical sites and used images from the same vendor's scanners. Here,\nwe investigated how a model trained for one machine and one anatomical site\nworks on other machines and other sites. We trained a model on CBCT images\nacquired from one vendor's scanners for head and neck cancer patients and\napplied it to images from another vendor's scanners and for other disease\nsites. We found that generalizability could be a significant problem for this\nparticular application when applying a trained DL model to datasets from\nanother vendor's scanners. We then explored three practical solutions based on\nTL to solve this generalization problem: the target model, which is trained on\na target domain from scratch; the combined model, which is trained on both\nsource and target domain datasets from scratch; and the adapted model, which\nfine-tunes the trained source model to a target domain. We found that when\nthere are sufficient data in the target domain, all three models can achieve\ngood performance.

The present DM abundance, including the\nCP-violation in the DM sector and the resulting present asymmetry are\ndetermined entirely by a single semi-annihilation process at next-to-leading\norder. For large CP-violation in this process, we find that a nearly complete\nasymmetry can be obtained in the DM sector, with the observed DM density being\ndominated by the (anti-)DM particle. The presence of additional\npair-annihilation processes can modify the ratio of DM and anti-DM number\ndensities further, if the pair-annihilation is active subsequent to the\ndecoupling of the semi-annihilation.

Specifically, we give the first coreset of size that depends only on\n$k$, $\\epsilon$ and the excluded-minor size, and our running time is\nquasi-linear (in the size of the input graph).\n  The main innovation in our new algorithm is that is iterative; it first\nreduces the $n$ input points to roughly $O(\\log n)$ reweighted points, then to\n$O(\\log\\log n)$, and so forth until the size is independent of $n$. Each step\nin this iterative size reduction is based on the importance sampling framework\nof Feldman and Langberg (STOC 2011), with a crucial adaptation that reduces the\nnumber of \\emph{distinct points}, by employing a terminal embedding (where low\ndistortion is guaranteed only for the distance from every terminal to all other\npoints). Our terminal embedding is technically involved and relies on\nshortest-path separators, a standard tool in planar and excluded-minor graphs.\n  Furthermore, our new algorithm is applicable also in Euclidean metrics, by\nsimply using a recent terminal embedding result of Narayanan and Nelson, (STOC\n2019), which extends the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma. We thus obtain an\nefficient coreset construction in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces, thereby\nmatching and simplifying state-of-the-art results (Sohler and Woodruff, FOCS\n2018; Huang and Vishnoi, STOC 2020).\n  In addition, we also employ terminal embedding with additive distortion to\nobtain small coresets in graphs with bounded highway dimension, and use\napplications of our coresets to obtain improved approximation schemes, e.g., an\nimproved PTAS for planar k-Median via a new centroid set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:53:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 13:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-16"}

As described in our previous paper\n[arXiv:1903.06564v1], the detector can be installed in the decommissioned TI18\ntunnel, about 480 m downstream the ATLAS cavern, after the first bending\ndipoles of the LHC arc. In that location, the prolongation of the beam\nLine-of-Sight from Interaction Point IP1 to TI18 traverses about 100 m of rock.\nThe detector intercepts the intense neutrino flux, generated by the LHC beams\ncolliding in IP1, at large pseudorapidity eta, where neutrino energies can\nexceed a TeV. This paper focuses on optimizing global features of the\nexperiment, like detector mass and acceptance. Since the neutrino-nucleon\ninteraction cross section grows almost linearly with energy, the detector can\nbe light and still collect a considerable sample of neutrino events; in the\npresent study it weighs less than 3 tons. The detector is positioned off the\nbeam axis, slightly above the ideal prolongation of the LHC beam from the\nstraight section, covering 7.4 < eta < 9.2. In this configuration, the flux at\nhigh energies (0.5-1.5 TeV and beyond) is found to be dominated by neutrinos\noriginating directly from IP1, mostly from charm decays, of which about 50% are\nelectron neutrinos and about 5% are tau neutrinos. The contribution of pion and\nkaon decays to the muon neutrino flux is studied by means of simulations that\nembed the LHC optics and found small at high energies.

Using the theory of controlled rough paths, we derive a class of rough\ngeophysical fluid dynamics (RGFD) models as critical points of rough action\nfunctionals. These RGFD models characterize Lagrangian trajectories in fluid\ndynamics as geometric rough paths (GRP) on the manifold of diffeomorphic maps.\nThree constrained variational approaches are formulated for the derivation of\nthese models. The first is the Clebsch formulation, in which the constraints\nare imposed as rough advection laws. The second is the Hamilton-Pontryagin\nformulation, in which the constraints are imposed as right-invariant rough\nvector fields. The third is the Euler--Poincar\\'e formulation in which the\nvariations are constrained. These variational principles lead directly to the\nLie--Poisson Hamiltonian formulation of fluid dynamics on geometric rough\npaths. The GRP framework preserves the geometric structure of fluid dynamics\nobtained by using Lie group reduction to pass from Lagrangian to Eulerian\nvariational principles, thereby yielding a rough formulation of the Kelvin\ncirculation theorem. The rough-path variational approach includes non-Markovian\nperturbations of the Lagrangian fluid trajectories. In particular, memory\neffects can be introduced through this formulation through a judicious choice\nof the rough path (e.g. a realization of a fractional Brownian motion). In the\nspecial case when the rough path is a realization of a semimartingale, we\nrecover the SGFD models in Holm (2015). However, by eliminating the need for\nstochastic variational tools, we retain a pathwise interpretation of the\nLagrangian trajectories. In contrast, the Lagrangian trajectories in the\nstochastic framework are described by stochastic integrals which do not have a\npathwise interpretation. Thus, the rough path formulation restores this\nproperty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 09:59:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 10:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

Recently, HHG from atoms in a phase and\npolarization structured laser was demonstrated and interpreted based on the\ntransverse electric field component of the driving pulse. Here we point out\nthat as dictated by Maxwell equations, such fields have a longitudinal\ncomponent which in general has a fundamental influence on the charge dynamics.\nFor instance, its interplay with the transversal field component enables\nendowing the emitted radiation locally with circular polarization and a defined\npolarity. It is shown that the time-dependent Stokes parameters defining the\npolarization state of HHG can be tuned by varying the waist of the driving\nfield which in turn, changes the ratio between the longitudinal and transverse\nelectric-field components of the driving laser. In addition, employing a\nmultipole expansion of the produced harmonics exposes the specific multipolar\ncharacter and the relation to the spatial structure of the driving field\npolarization states. The scheme proposed here allows a full polarization\ncontrol of the emitted harmonics by only one driving laser. A tighter focusing\nof the driving pulse renders possible the emission of harmonics with both even\nand odd spatial symmetry. The underlying mechanism is due to the fundamental\ninterplay between the transverse and longitudinal components of the laser's\nelectromagnetic vector potential. The ratio between those components is\ncontrollable by just focusing the laser spot, pointing to an accessible tool\nfor polarization and polarity control of the high harmonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 09:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

That being said, the\nfield has still to frame a suite of benchmarks for the highly desirable setting\nof continual few-shot learning, where the learner is presented a number of\nfew-shot tasks, one after the other, and then asked to perform well on a\nvalidation set stemming from all previously seen tasks. Continual few-shot\nlearning has a small computational footprint and is thus an excellent setting\nfor efficient investigation and experimentation. In this paper we first define\na theoretical framework for continual few-shot learning, taking into account\nrecent literature, then we propose a range of flexible benchmarks that unify\nthe evaluation criteria and allows exploring the problem from multiple\nperspectives. As part of the benchmark, we introduce a compact variant of\nImageNet, called SlimageNet64, which retains all original 1000 classes but only\ncontains 200 instances of each one (a total of 200K data-points) downscaled to\n64 x 64 pixels. We provide baselines for the proposed benchmarks using a number\nof popular few-shot learning algorithms, as a result, exposing previously\nunknown strengths and weaknesses of those algorithms in continual and\ndata-limited settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 16:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

Deep Learning, allows neural networks to be trained using\nhuge datasets and also removes the need for human extracted features, as it\nautomates the feature learning process. In the hearth of training deep neural\nnetworks, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, we find backpropagation, that\nby computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of\nthe network for a given input, it allows the weights of the network to be\nadjusted to better perform in the given task. In this paper, we propose a\nhybrid method that uses both backpropagation and evolutionary strategies to\ntrain Convolutional Neural Networks, where the evolutionary strategies are used\nto help to avoid local minimas and fine-tune the weights, so that the network\nachieves higher accuracy results.

We argue that to make the most of this exciting field we should resist\nthe temptation of assuming that forecasting can be reduced to brute-force data\nanalytics. This owes to the fact that modelling, as we illustrate below,\nrequires mastering the art of selecting relevant variables. More specifically,\nwe investigate the subtle relation between \"data and models\" by focussing on\nthe role played by algorithmic complexity, which contributed to making\nmathematically rigorous the long-standing idea that to understand empirical\nphenomena is to describe the rules which generate the data in terms which are\n\"simpler\" than the data itself.\n  A key issue for the appraisal of the relation between algorithmic complexity\nand algorithmic learning is to do with a much needed clarification on the\nrelated but distinct concepts of compressibility, determinism and\npredictability. To this end we will illustrate that the evolution law of a\nchaotic system is compressibile, but a generic initial condition for it is not,\nmaking the time series generated by chaotic systems incompressible in general.\nHence knowledge of the rules which govern an empirical phenomenon are not\nsufficient for predicting its outcomes. In turn this implies that there is more\nto understanding phenomena than learning -- even from data alone -- such rules.\nThis can be achieved only in those cases when we are capable of \"good\nmodelling\".\n  Clearly, the very idea of algorithmic complexity rests on Turing's seminal\nanalysis of computation. This motivates our remarks on this extremely telling\nexample of analogy-based abstract modelling which is nonetheless heavily\ninformed by empirical facts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 14:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}
