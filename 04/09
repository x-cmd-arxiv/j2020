Finally, we compare the performances of our enhanced\narchitecture against EWC and RNNs on a set of standard CL benchmarks, adapted\nto the sequential data processing scenario.

In many practical instances, biomedical\ndevices work on time-scales comparable to the intrinsic relaxation time of\nRBCs: thus, a systematic understanding of the time-dependent response of\nerythrocyte membranes is crucial for the effective design of such devices. So\nfar, this information has been deduced from experimental data, which do not\nnecessarily adapt to the the broad variety of the fluid dynamic conditions that\ncan be encountered in practice. This work explores the novel possibility of\nstudying the time-dependent response of an erythrocyte membrane to external\nmechanical loads via ab-initio, mesoscale numerical simulations, with a primary\nfocus on the detailed characterisation of the RBC relaxation time $t_c$\nfollowing the arrest of the external mechanical load.

However,\none major concern is the closed set nature of the classification decision on\nthe trained classes, which can have serious consequences in safety critical\nsystems. When the deep neural network is in a streaming environment, fast\ninterpretation of this classification is required to determine if the\nclassification result is trusted. Un-trusted classifications can occur when the\ninput data to the deep neural network changes over time. One type of change\nthat can occur is concept evolution, where a new class is introduced that the\ndeep neural network was not trained on. In the majority of deep neural network\narchitectures, the only option is to assign this instance to one of the classes\nit was trained on, which would be incorrect. The aim of this research is to\ndetect the arrival of a new class in the stream. Existing work on interpreting\ndeep neural networks often focuses on neuron activations to provide visual\ninterpretation and feature extraction. Our novel approach, coined DeepStreamCE,\nuses streaming approaches for real-time concept evolution detection in deep\nneural networks.

LadaBERT achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on various\npublic datasets while the training overheads can be reduced by an order of\nmagnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 17:18:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 15:15:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

A microfluidic\nviscometer enabled the use of small sample volumes in determining viscosity as\na function of shear rate and concentration in the non-aqueous solvent,\nacetonitrile, both with and without supporting salts.

BR1202-0725 is a galaxy group consisting of a QSO, a\nsub-millimeter galaxy (SMG), and two Ly-alpha emitters. We detected HF in\nemission in the QSO and possibly in absorption in the SMG, while water is\ndetected in emission in both the QSO and SMG. The QSO is the most luminous HF\nemitter yet found and has the same ratio of HF emission line to infrared\nluminosity as a sample of local AGN and the Orion Bar. This consistency covers\nabout 10 orders-of-magnitude in infrared luminosity, L_IR. Based on the\nconclusions of a study of HF emission in the Orion Bar and modeling, the HF\nemission in the QSO is either excited by collisions with electrons and H2 in\nmolecular plasmas irradiated by the AGN and intense star formation or\npredominately by collisions with H2, with a modest contribution from electrons,\nin a relatively high temperature (~120 K), dense (~10^5 cm^-3) medium.

However, these scenarios are not always plausible, in particular when\nflares are delayed to very late times after the burst. Recently, a new scenario\nwas proposed that suggests X-ray flares can be the result of the passing of a\nlong-lived reverse shock through a stratified ejecta, with the advantage that\nit does not require late-time engine activity. In this work, we numerically\ndemonstrate this scenario to be physically plausible, by performing\nonedimensional simulations of ejecta dynamics and emission using our novel\nmoving-mesh relativistic hydrodynamics code.

Training such a model would\ntraditionally require a large dataset of textured meshes, but unfortunately,\nexisting datasets of meshes lack detailed textures. We instead propose a new\ntraining methodology that allows learning from collections of 2D images without\nany 3D information. To do so, we train our model to explain a distribution of\nimages by modelling each image as a 3D foreground object placed in front of a\n2D background. Thus, it learns to generate meshes that when rendered, produce\nimages similar to those in its training set.\n  A well-known problem when generating meshes with deep networks is the\nemergence of self-intersections, which are problematic for many use-cases. As a\nsecond contribution we therefore introduce a new generation process for 3D\nmeshes that guarantees no self-intersections arise, based on the physical\nintuition that faces should push one another out of the way as they move.\n  We conduct extensive experiments on our approach, reporting quantitative and\nqualitative results on both synthetic data and natural images.

Such worlds are representative of early Earth,\nMars and Venus, and analogous exoplanets. H$_2$O photodissociation controls the\natmospheric photochemistry of these worlds through production of reactive OH,\nwhich dominates the removal of atmospheric trace gases. The near-UV (NUV;\n$>200$ nm) absorption cross-sections of H$_2$O play an outsized role in OH\nproduction; these cross-sections were heretofore unmeasured at habitable\ntemperatures ($<373$ K). We present the first measurements of NUV H$_2$O\nabsorption at $292$ K, and show it to absorb orders of magnitude more than\npreviously assumed. To explore the implications of these new cross-sections, we\nemploy a photochemical model; we first intercompare it with two others and\nresolve past literature disagreement. The enhanced OH production due to these\nhigher cross-sections leads to efficient recombination of CO and O$_2$,\nsuppressing both by orders of magnitude relative to past predictions and\neliminating the low-outgassing \"false positive\" scenario for O$_2$ as a\nbiosignature around solar-type stars. Enhanced [OH] increases rainout of\nreductants to the surface, relevant to prebiotic chemistry, and may also\nsuppress CH$_4$ and H$_2$; the latter depends on whether burial of reductants\nis inhibited on the underlying planet, as is argued for abiotic worlds. While\nwe focus on CO$_2$-rich worlds, our results are relevant to anoxic planets in\ngeneral. Overall, our work advances the state-of-the-art of photochemical\nmodels by providing crucial new H$_2$O cross-sections and resolving past\ndisagreement in the literature, and suggests that detection of spectrally\nactive trace gases like CO in rocky exoplanet atmospheres may be more\nchallenging than previously considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 18:05:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 18:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

These\nrequirements can be fulfilled by using the available inventory, collecting\nwaste vegetable oil or purchasing virgin oil. The problem consists in\ndetermining a period (cyclic) planning for the collection and purchasing of oil\nsuch that the total collection, inventory and purchasing costs are minimized,\nwhile meeting the company's oil requirements and all the operational\nconstraints. We propose a MIP-based heuristic which solves a relaxed model\nwithout routing, constructs routes taking into account the relaxation's\nsolution and then improves these routes by solving the capacitated vehicle\nrouting problem associated to each period. Following this approach, an a\nposteriori performance guarantee is ensured, as the approach provides both a\nlower bound and a feasible solution. The performed computational experiments\nshow that the MIP-based heuristic is very fast and effective as it is able to\nencounter near optimal solutions with low gaps within seconds, improving\nseveral of the best known results using just a fraction of the time spent by a\nstate-of-the-art heuristic. A remarkable fact is that the proposed MIP-based\nheuristic improves over the best known results for all the large instances\navailable in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 18:14:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 14:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-22"}

To examine the robustness of ReID\nsystems is rather important because the insecurity of ReID systems may cause\nsevere losses, e.g., the criminals may use the adversarial perturbations to\ncheat the CCTV systems. In this work, we examine the insecurity of current\nbest-performing ReID models by proposing a learning-to-mis-rank formulation to\nperturb the ranking of the system output. As the cross-dataset transferability\nis crucial in the ReID domain, we also perform a back-box attack by developing\na novel multi-stage network architecture that pyramids the features of\ndifferent levels to extract general and transferable features for the\nadversarial perturbations.

An optimal orbital selection for\nFCI (OptOrbFCI) is proposed to boost the power of existing FCI solvers to\npursue the basis set limit under a computational budget. The optimization\nproblem coincides with that of the complete active space SCF method (CASSCF),\nwhile OptOrbFCI is algorithmically quite different. OptOrbFCI effectively finds\nan optimal rotation matrix via solving a constrained optimization problem\ndirectly to compress the orbitals of large basis sets to one with a manageable\nsize, conducts FCI calculations only on rotated orbital sets, and produces a\nvariational ground-state energy and its wave function. Coupled with coordinate\ndescent full configuration interaction (CDFCI), we demonstrate the efficiency\nand accuracy of the method on the carbon dimer and nitrogen dimer under basis\nsets up to cc-pV5Z. We also benchmark the binding curve of the nitrogen dimer\nunder the cc-pVQZ basis set with 28 selected orbitals, which provide\nconsistently lower ground-state energies than the FCI results under the cc-pVDZ\nbasis set. The dissociation energy in this case is found to be of higher\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 19:01:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 15:52:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 03:38:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 30 Aug 2020 04:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

Therefore, when a new pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2\ncauses an outbreak, the non-pharmaceutical isolation strategies (e.g., social\ndistancing) are the only possible response to disrupt its spreading. To this\nend, we introduce the new epidemic model (SICARS) and compare the centralized\n(C), decentralized (D), and combined (C+D) social distancing strategies, and\nanalyze their efficiency to control the dynamics of COVID-19 on heterogeneous\ncomplex networks. Our analysis shows that the centralized social distancing is\nnecessary to minimize the pandemic spreading. The decentralized strategy is\ninsufficient when used alone, but offers the best results when combined with\nthe centralized one. Indeed, the (C+D) is the most efficient isolation strategy\nat mitigating the network superspreaders and reducing the highest node degrees\nto less than 10% of their initial values. Our results also indicate that\nstronger social distancing, e.g., cutting 75% of social ties, can reduce the\noutbreak by 75% for the C isolation, by 33% for the D isolation, and by 87% for\nthe (C+D) isolation strategy. Finally, we study the impact of proactive versus\nreactive isolation strategies, as well as their delayed enforcement. We find\nthat the reactive response to the pandemic is less efficient, and delaying the\nadoption of isolation measures by over one month (since the outbreak onset in a\nregion) can have alarming effects; thus, our study contributes to an\nunderstanding of the COVID-19 pandemic both in space and time.

To evaluate QAGS, we collect human\njudgments of factual consistency on model-generated summaries for the\nCNN/DailyMail (Hermann et al., 2015) and XSUM (Narayan et al., 2018)\nsummarization datasets. QAGS has substantially higher correlations with these\njudgments than other automatic evaluation metrics.

Unfortunately, so are many other astrophysical phenomena - most\nnotably other planets in the system. In this work, an argument of reductio ad\nabsurdum is invoked, by deriving the transit timing effects that are impossible\nfor a single exomoon to produce. Our work derives three key analytic tests.\nFirst, one may exploit the fact that a TTV signal from an exomoon should be\naccompanied by transit duration variations (TDVs), and that one can derive a\nTDV floor as a minimum expected level of variability. Cases for which the TDV\nupper limit is below this floor can thus be killed as exomoon candidates.\nSecond, formulae are provided for estimating whether moons are expected to be\n'killable' when no TDVs presently exist, thus enabling the community to\nestimate whether it's even worth deriving TDVs in the first place. Third, a TTV\nceiling is derived, above which exomoons should never be able to produce TTV\namplitudes. These tools are applied to a catalog of TTVs and TDVs for two and\nhalf thousand Kepler Objects Interest, revealing over two hundred cases that\ncannot be due to a moon. These tests are also applied to the exomoon candidate\nKepler-1625b i, which comfortably passes the criteria.

This is due to the fact that typical UAVs can only\naccommodate rigid manipulators with few degrees of freedom, which limits their\ncapability to compensate for disturbances caused by the vehicle positioning\nerrors. Moreover, UAVs have to minimize external contact forces in order to\nmaintain stability. Biological systems, on the other hand, exploit softness to\novercome similar limitations, and leverage compliance to enable aggressive\ngrasping. This paper investigates control and trajectory optimization for a\nsoft aerial manipulator, consisting of a quadrotor and a tendon-actuated soft\ngripper, in which the advantages of softness can be fully exploited. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first work at the intersection between soft\nmanipulation and UAV control. We present a decoupled approach for the quadrotor\nand the soft gripper, combining (i) a geometric controller and a minimum-snap\ntrajectory optimization for the quadrotor (rigid) base, with (ii) a\nquasi-static finite element model and control-space interpolation for the soft\ngripper. We prove that the geometric controller asymptotically stabilizes the\nquadrotor velocity and attitude despite the addition of the soft load. Finally,\nwe evaluate the proposed system in a realistic soft dynamics simulator, and\nshow that: (i) the geometric controller is fairly insensitive to the soft\npayload, (ii) the platform can reliably grasp unknown objects despite\ninaccurate positioning and initial conditions, and (iii) the decoupled\ncontroller is amenable for real-time execution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 20:24:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 00:55:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 03:30:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

It is of practical use to deal with a large amount of information in\nthe complex system that is hard to estimate. Weather forecasting is one of the\napplications, where the prediction of meteorological data are corrected given\nthe observations. Numerous approaches are contained in data assimilation. One\nspecific sequential method is the Kalman Filter. The core is to estimate\nunknown information with the new data that is measured and the prior data that\nis predicted. As a matter of fact, there are different improved methods in the\nKalman Filter. In this project, the Ensemble Kalman Filter with perturbed\nobservations is considered. It is achieved by Monte Carlo simulation. In this\nmethod, the ensemble is involved in the calculation instead of the state\nvectors. In addition, the measurement with perturbation is viewed as the\nsuitable observation.

The\nthesis seeks to develop the Ensemble Kalman Filter with perturbed observation\ngradually.

PINNs incorporate all available\ninformation into a loss function, thus recasting the original problem into an\noptimization problem. In this paper, we extend PINNs to parameter and function\ninference for integral equations such as nonlocal Poisson and nonlocal\nturbulence models, and we refer to them as nonlocal PINNs (nPINNs). The\ncontribution of the paper is three-fold. First, we propose a unified nonlocal\noperator, which converges to the classical Laplacian as one of the operator\nparameters, the nonlocal interaction radius $\\delta$ goes to zero, and to the\nfractional Laplacian as $\\delta$ goes to infinity. This universal operator\nforms a super-set of classical Laplacian and fractional Laplacian operators\nand, thus, has the potential to fit a broad spectrum of data sets. We provide\ntheoretical convergence rates with respect to $\\delta$ and verify them via\nnumerical experiments. Second, we use nPINNs to estimate the two parameters,\n$\\delta$ and $\\alpha$. The strong non-convexity of the loss function yielding\nmultiple (good) local minima reveals the occurrence of the operator mimicking\nphenomenon: different pairs of estimated parameters could produce multiple\nsolutions of comparable accuracy. Third, we propose another nonlocal operator\nwith spatially variable order $\\alpha(y)$, which is more suitable for modeling\nturbulent Couette flow. Our results show that nPINNs can jointly infer this\nfunction as well as $\\delta$.

During execution, the RL agents often rely on\nsome domain-specific heuristic reward to guide them towards finding failures,\nbut constructing such a heuristic may be difficult or infeasible. Without a\nheuristic, the agent may only receive rewards at the time of failure, or even\nrewards that guide it away from failures. For example, some approaches give\nrewards for taking more-likely actions, because we want to find more-likely\nfailures. However, the agent may then learn to only take likely actions, and\nmay not be able to find a failure at all. Consequently, the problem becomes a\nhard-exploration problem, where rewards do not aid exploration. A new\nalgorithm, go-explore (GE), has recently set new records on benchmarks from the\nhard-exploration field. We apply GE to adaptive stress testing (AST), one\nexample of an RL-based falsification approach that provides a way to search for\nthe most-likely failure scenario. We simulate a scenario where an autonomous\nvehicle drives while a pedestrian is crossing the road.

In general, the\nstronger the commitment, i.e., longer and less flexible, the lower the price.\nHowever, longer and less flexible time commitments can increase cloud costs for\nusers if future workloads cannot utilize the VMs they committed to buying.\nLarge cloud customers often find it challenging to choose the right mix of\npurchasing options to reduce their long-term costs, while retaining the ability\nto adjust capacity up and down in response to workload variations.\n  To address the problem, we design policies to optimize long-term cloud costs\nby selecting a mix of VM purchasing options based on short- and long-term\nexpectations of workload utilization. We consider a batch trace spanning 4\nyears from a large shared cluster for a major state University system that\nincludes 14k cores and 60 million job submissions, and evaluate how these jobs\ncould be judiciously executed using cloud servers using our approach.

In particular,\nthe proposed robust dispatch method obtains operational strategies by solving a\nnominal uncertainty-free dispatch problem, whose complexity is identical to a\ndeterministic problem. The robustness against uncertainties is enhanced by\nendowing the nominal dispatch model with properly tightened constraints\nconsidering time-variant uncertainty sets.

Furthermore, the budget uncertainty set is newly\ncombined with constraint tightening to flexibly adjust the conservativeness\nlevel of robust solutions.

In the\npioneering work of Guibas & Sedgewick (1978), both 2-3 and 2-3-4 variants of RB\ntrees had been considered, but further study of the former had been abandoned\ndue to the higher number of rotations in the insert algorithm.

However, the top-down deletion\nalgorithm of LLRB is still very complicated and highly inefficient. In this\npaper, we reconsider 2-3 red-black trees in which both children of a node\ncannot be red. We propose a parity-seeking delete algorithm with the basic idea\nof making the deficient subtree on a par with its sibling: either by fixing the\ndeficient subtree or by turning the sibling deficient as well, ascending\ndeficiency to the parent node. Interestingly, the proposed parity-seeking\ndelete algorithm works for 2-3-4 RB trees as well. Our experiments show that\n2-3 RB trees are almost as efficient as RB trees and twice faster than LLRB\ntrees. Besides, RB trees with the proposed parity-seeking delete algorithm have\nthe same number of rotations and almost identical running time as the classical\ndelete algorithm. While being extremely efficient, the proposed parity-seeking\ndelete algorithm is easily understandable and suitable for pedagogical\npurposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 03:12:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 10:17:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 02:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Existing methods for community detection\nfocus only on single-subject analysis of dynamic networks; while recent\nextensions to multiple-subjects analysis are limited to static networks. To\novercome these limitations, we propose a multi-subject, Markov-switching\nstochastic block model (MSS-SBM) to identify state-related changes in brain\ncommunity organization over a group of individuals. We first formulate a\nmultilayer extension of SBM to describe the time-dependent, multi-subject brain\nnetworks. We develop a novel procedure for fitting the multilayer SBM that\nbuilds on multislice modularity maximization which can uncover a common\ncommunity partition of all layers (subjects) simultaneously. By augmenting with\na dynamic Markov switching process, our proposed method is able to capture a\nset of distinct, recurring temporal states with respect to inter-community\ninteractions over subjects and the change points between them. Simulation shows\naccurate community recovery and tracking of dynamic community regimes over\nmultilayer networks by the MSS-SBM. Application to task fMRI reveals meaningful\nnon-assortative brain community motifs, e.g., core-periphery structure at the\ngroup level, that are associated with language comprehension and motor\nfunctions suggesting their putative role in complex information integration.\nOur approach detected dynamic reconfiguration of modular connectivity elicited\nby varying task demands and identified unique profiles of intra and\ninter-community connectivity across different task conditions.

Damage may accumulate on structures due to different\nenvironmental and human-induced factors. Numerous monitoring and detection\napproaches have been developed to provide practical means for early warning\nagainst structural damage or any type of anomaly. Considerable effort has been\nput into vibration-based methods, which utilize the vibration response of the\nmonitored structure to assess its condition and identify structural damage.\nMeanwhile, with emerging computing power and sensing technology in the last\ndecade, Machine Learning (ML) and especially Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have\nbecome more feasible and extensively used in vibration-based structural damage\ndetection with elegant performance and often with rigorous accuracy.

For that reason, it costs a lot of memory\nand substantial computational resources, and also causes overfitting. It is\nknown that some parameters are redundant and can be removed from the network\nwithout decreasing performance. Many sparse regularization criteria have been\nproposed to solve this problem. In a convolutional neural network (CNN), group\nsparse regularizations are often used to remove unnecessary subsets of the\nweights, such as filters or channels. When we apply a group sparse\nregularization for the weights connected to a neuron as a group, each\nconvolution filter is not treated as a target group in the regularization. In\nthis paper, we introduce the concept of hierarchical grouping to solve this\nproblem, and we propose several hierarchical group sparse regularization\ncriteria for CNNs. Our proposed the hierarchical group sparse regularization\ncan treat the weight for the input-neuron or the output-neuron as a group and\nconvolutional filter as a group in the same group to prune the unnecessary\nsubsets of weights. As a result, we can prune the weights more adequately\ndepending on the structure of the network and the number of channels keeping\nhigh performance.

We find\nthat framing effects are relatively insensitive to reputational incentives:\nobservability did not significantly amplify sensitivity to moral framing.\nHowever, our results are not inconsistent with the possibility that\nobservability has some amplification effect; quantitatively, the observed\nframing effect was 74% as large when decisions were private as when they were\nobservable. These results suggest that moral frames may tap into moral\npreferences that are relatively deeply internalized, and that power of moral\nframes to promote prosociality may not be strongly enhanced by making the\nmorally-framed behavior observable to others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 08:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-10"}

AD takes source code of a function\nas input and produces source code of the derived function. By applying the\nchain rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of arbitrary order can\nbe computed automatically, accurately to working precision, and using at most a\nsmall constant factor more arithmetic operations than the original program.\n  This paper presents AD techniques available in ROOT, supported by Cling, to\nproduce derivatives of arbitrary C/C++ functions through implementing source\ncode transformation and employing the chain rule of differential calculus in\nboth forward mode and reverse mode.

Our results apply to general multi-class classifiers\nthat map from an input space into a decision space, including artificial neural\nnetworks used in deep learning applications. Two classes of attacks are\nconsidered. The first class involves adversarial examples and concerns the\nintroduction of small perturbations of the input data that cause\nmisclassification. The second class, introduced here for the first time and\nnamed stealth attacks, involves small perturbations to the AI system itself.\nHere the perturbed system produces whatever output is desired by the attacker\non a specific small data set, perhaps even a single input, but performs as\nnormal on a validation set (which is unknown to the attacker). We show that in\nboth cases, i.e., in the case of an attack based on adversarial examples and in\nthe case of a stealth attack, the dimensionality of the AI's decision-making\nspace is a major contributor to the AI's susceptibility. For attacks based on\nadversarial examples, a second crucial parameter is the absence of local\nconcentrations in the data probability distribution, a property known as\nSmeared Absolute Continuity. According to our findings, robustness to\nadversarial examples requires either (a) the data distributions in the AI's\nfeature space to have concentrated probability density functions or (b) the\ndimensionality of the AI's decision variables to be sufficiently small.

We consider a generalization of this model that features\nindependently controllable strengths of the co- and counter-rotating terms of\nthe interaction Hamiltonian. We study this system in the semiclassical (mean\nfield) limit, i.e., neglecting the role of quantum fluctuations. Under this\napproximation, the model is described by a set of nonlinear differential\nequations, which determine the system's semiclassical evolution. By taking a\ndynamical systems approach, we perform a comprehensive analysis of these\nequations to reveal an abundance of novel and complex dynamics. Examples of the\nnovel phenomena that we observe are the emergence of superradiant oscillations\narising due to Hopf bifurcations, and the appearance of a pair of chaotic\nattractors arising from period-doubling cascades, followed by their collision\nto form a single, larger chaotic attractor via a sequence of infinitely many\nhomoclinic bifurcations. Moreover, we find that a flip of the collective spin\ncan result in the sudden emergence of chaotic dynamics. Overall, we provide a\ncomprehensive roadmap of the possible dynamics that arise in the unbalanced,\nopen Dicke model in the form of a phase diagram in the plane of the two\ninteraction strengths. Hence, we lay out the foundations to make further\nadvances in the study of the fingerprint of semiclassical chaos when\nconsidering the master equation of the unbalanced Dicke model, that is, the\npossibility of studying a manifestation of quantum chaos in a specific,\nexperimentally realizable system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 11:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

It\nis due to the presence of the intramolecular interactions because the\ncontributions to the virial and potential energy resulting from the\nintermolecular interactions still exhibit strong linear dependence.\nInterestingly, in contrast to the results reported for simple-liquids, the\nslope of the mentioned linear dependence is different than the values of the\ndensity scaling exponent. However, our findings show that for the quasi-real\nmaterials, the slope of dependence between the virial and potential energy\n(resulting from the intermolecular interactions) strongly depends on the range\nof intermolecular distances that are taken into account. Consequently, the\nvalue of the slope of the discussed relationship, which enables satisfactory\ndensity scaling, can be obtained. Furthermore, we show that the above crucial\nrange of intermolecular distances does not depend on the structure of the\nsystem as well as on the thermodynamic conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 11:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

On the other hand, at high\ntraffic reduction ratios, better power efficiency can be accomplished by\nplacing VMs in lower layer nodes (relays). Our results indicate that utilizing\nPONs and serving heterogeneous VMs can save up to 19% of the total power. Based\non the MILP model insights, a heuristic is developed with very comparable\nMILP-heuristic power consumption values. We considered three scenarios that\nrepresent different levels of homogeneous and heterogeneous VM CPU demands.\nGood agreement was observed between the heuristic results (17% power saving)\nand the MILP which results in 19% power saving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 12:38:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 15:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

In this paper,\nwe propose a self-supervised equivariant attention mechanism (SEAM) to discover\nadditional supervision and narrow the gap. Our method is based on the\nobservation that equivariance is an implicit constraint in fully supervised\nsemantic segmentation, whose pixel-level labels take the same spatial\ntransformation as the input images during data augmentation.

Both parts are\nfully owned and maintained by the community, as is the integration of the\nresults in the existing Wikipedia editions. This architecture will make more\nencyclopedic content available to more people in their own language, and at the\nsame time allow more people to contribute knowledge and reach more people with\ntheir contributions, no matter what their respective language backgrounds.\nAdditionally, Wikilambda will unlock a new type of knowledge asset people can\nshare in through the Wikimedia projects, functions, which will vastly expand\nwhat people can do with knowledge from Wikimedia, and provide a new venue to\ncollaborate and to engage the creativity of contributors from all around the\nworld. These two projects will considerably expand the capabilities of the\nWikimedia platform to enable every single human being to freely share in the\nsum of all knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 22:25:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-13"}

The IHME models have received extensive\nattention in social and mass media, and have influenced policy makers at the\nhighest levels of the United States government. For effective policy making the\naccurate assessment of uncertainty, as well as accurate point predictions, are\nnecessary because the risks inherent in a decision must be taken into account,\nespecially in the present setting of a novel disease affecting millions of\nlives. To assess the accuracy of the IHME models, we examine both forecast\naccuracy as well as the predictive performance of the 95% prediction intervals\nprovided by the IHME models. We find that the initial IHME model underestimates\nthe uncertainty surrounding the number of daily deaths substantially.\nSpecifically, the true number of next day deaths fell outside the IHME\nprediction intervals as much as 70% of the time, in comparison to the expected\nvalue of 5%. In addition, we note that the performance of the initial model\ndoes not improve with shorter forecast horizons. Regarding the updated models,\nour analyses indicate that the later models do not show any improvement in the\naccuracy of the point estimate predictions. In fact, there is some evidence\nthat this accuracy has actually decreased over the initial models. Moreover,\nwhen considering the updated models, while we observe a larger percentage of\nstates having actual values lying inside the 95% prediction intervals (PI), our\nanalysis suggests that this observation may be attributed to the widening of\nthe PIs. The width of these intervals calls into question the usefulness of the\npredictions to drive policy making and resource allocation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 01:12:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 02:58:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 01:00:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 24 May 2020 12:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

However, these methods have reached some limitations\nwith (1) the requirement of large-scale face recognition (FR) training data\nwith age labels, which is limited in practice; (2) heavy deep network\narchitectures for high performance; and (3) their evaluations are usually taken\nplace on age-related face databases while neglecting the standard large-scale\nFR databases to guarantee robustness. This work presents a novel Lightweight\nAttentive Angular Distillation (LIAAD) approach to Large-scale Lightweight AiFR\nthat overcomes these limitations. Given two high-performance heavy networks as\nteachers with different specialized knowledge, LIAAD introduces a learning\nparadigm to efficiently distill the age-invariant attentive and angular\nknowledge from those teachers to a lightweight student network making it more\npowerful with higher FR accuracy and robust against age factor. Consequently,\nLIAAD approach is able to take the advantages of both FR datasets with and\nwithout age labels to train an AiFR model. Far apart from prior distillation\nmethods mainly focusing on accuracy and compression ratios in closed-set\nproblems, our LIAAD aims to solve the open-set problem, i.e. large-scale face\nrecognition.

This goal is\ntypically pursued under the umbrella of stochastic optimization with algorithms\nthat optimize a scoring function. Research repeatedly shows that current\nscoring function, though steadily improving, correlate weakly with molecular\nactivity. Inspired by recent momentum in generative deep learning, this paper\nproposes and evaluates an alternative approach to generating\nfunctionally-relevant three-dimensional structures of a protein. Though\ntypically deep generative models struggle with highly-structured data, the work\npresented here circumvents this challenge via graph-generative models. A\ncomprehensive evaluation of several deep architectures shows the promise of\ngenerative models in directly revealing the latent space for sampling novel\ntertiary structures, as well as in highlighting axes/factors that carry\nstructural meaning and open the black box often associated with deep models.\nThe work presented here is a first step towards interpretative, deep generative\nmodels becoming viable and informative complementary approaches to protein\nstructure prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 17:40:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 06:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

Indeed, rare discoveries of compounds with large\nRashba coefficients are invariably greeted as pleasant surprises. We advance\nthe understanding of the \"Rashba Scale\" using the \"inverse design\" approach by\nformulating theoretically the relevant design principle and then identifying\ncompounds that satisfy it. We show that the presence of energy band\nanti-crossing provides a causal design principle of compounds with large Rashba\ncoefficients, leading to the identification via first-principles calculations\nof 34 rationally designed strong-Rashba compounds. Since topological insulators\nmust have band anti crossing, this leads us to establish an interesting cross\nfunctionality of \"Topological Rashba Insulators\" (TRI) that may provide a\nplatform for the simultaneous control of spin splitting and spin-polarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 21:16:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

Systematic excavation has been carried out since\n2001, leading to the partial exploration of an important Pleistocene deposit,\nextraordinarily rich in lithic and faunal remains. The aim of this paper is to\n(1) present the stratigraphic sequence of Roccia San Sebastiano, and (2)\ntechnologically describe the lithic materials of squares F14 t18, t19, t20; E16\nt16, t17, t18 recently recognised as Uluzzian. The stratigraphic sequence is\nmore than 3 metres thick and dates from the Middle to the Upper Palaeolithic.\nIt contains different techno-complexes: Gravettian, Aurignacian, Uluzzian and\nMousterian. In the Uluzzian lithic assemblage mostly local pebbles of chert\nwere used in order to produce small-sized objects. The concept of debitage\nmainly deals with unidirectional debitage with absent or fairly accurate\nmanagement of the convexities and angles; the striking platforms are usually\nnatural or made by one stroke. It is attested the use of both direct freehand\npercussion and bipolar technique on anvil in the same reduction sequence.\nAmongst the retouched tools the presence of two lunates is of note. This study\nof the Roccia San Sebastiano Uluzzian lithic complexes is significant for\nunderstanding the dynamics of the transition from Middle to Upper Palaeolithic\nin the Tyrrhenian margin of southern Italy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 16:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

We present a neural architecture, Vulcan, that\nsuccessfully demonstrates both these requirements.

It\nconcurrently represents the meanings of tokens in a line by recursively\nembedding the lines where they are most recently defined.
