Although their dispersion relations are largely\nindependent of $c/v_{\\mathrm{Ai}}$ for $c/v_{\\mathrm{Ai}}\\gtrsim 10$, the mass\nratio $m_{\\mathrm i}/m_{\\mathrm e}$ has a strong effect at scales smaller than\nthe ion inertial length. Moreover, we study the impact of relativistic electron\neffects on the dispersion relations. Based on our results, we recommend aiming\nfor a more realistic value of $m_{\\mathrm i}/m_{\\mathrm e}$ than for a more\nrealistic value of $c/v_{\\mathrm{Ai}}$ in non-relativistic plasma simulations\nif such a choice is necessary, although $\\dots$\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 17:13:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

The one-loop partition function around Euclidean AdS3 turns out\nto be given by the vacuum character of Virasoro group. This stems from the work\nof Brown and Henneaux (BH) who showed that, in AdS3 gravity with sensible\nasymptotic boundary conditions, an infinite group of (improper) diffeomorphisms\narises which acts canonically on phase space as two independent Virasoro\nsymmetries. The gauge group turns out to be composed of so-called ``proper''\ndiffeomorphisms which approach the identity at infinity fast enough. However,\nit is sometimes far from evident to identify where BH boundary conditions enter\nin the path integral, and much more difficult to see how the improper\ndiffeomorphisms are left out of the gauge group. In particular, in the metric\nformulation, Giombi, Maloney and Yin obtained the one-loop partition function\naround thermal AdS3 resorting to the heat kernel method to compute the\ndeterminants coming from the path integral. Here we identify how BH boundary\nconditions follow naturally from the usual requirement of square-integrability\nof the metric perturbations. Also, and equally relevant, we clarify how the\nquotient by only proper diffeomorphisms is implemented, promoting the improper\ndiffeomorphisms to symmetries in the path integral. Our strategy is general\nenough to apply to other approaches where square integrability is assumed.\nFinally, we show that square integrability implies that the asymptotic\nsymmetries in higher dimensional AdS gravity are just isometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 18:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

However, to\neffectively use that many images as input to lens inversion will require a\nre-evaluation of, and possibly upgrades to the existing methods. In this paper\nwe scrutinize the performance of the free-form lens inversion method Grale in\nthe regime of $150-1000$ input images, using synthetic massive galaxy clusters.\nOur results show that with an increasing number of input images, Grale produces\nimproved reconstructed mass distributions, with the fraction of the lens plane\nrecovered at better than $10\\%$ accuracy increasing from $40-50\\%$ for\n$\\sim\\!\\!150$ images to $65\\%$ for $\\sim\\!1000$ images. The reconstructed time\ndelays imply a more precise measurement of $H_0$, with $\\lesssim 1\\%$ bias.\nWhile the fidelity of the reconstruction improves with the increasing number of\nmultiple images used as model constraints, $\\sim 150$ to $\\sim 1000$, the lens\nplane rms deteriorates from $\\sim 0.11''$ to $\\sim 0.28''$. Since lens plane\nrms is not necessarily the best indicator of the quality of the mass\nreconstructions, looking for an alternative indicator is warranted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 18:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

In this\nproblem there exists a natural hardness order between parameters as for\ndifferent parameters the error-probailities curves (when the parameter is\nknown) are either identical, or one dominates the other. We can thus define\nminimax performance as the worst-case among parameters which are below some\nhardness level. Fortunately, there exists a universal minimax test, in the\nsense that it is minimax for all hardness levels simultaneously. Under this\ncriterion we also find the optimal test for composite hypothesis testing with\ntraining data. This criterion extends to the wide class of local asymptotic\nnormal models, in an asymptotic sense where the approximation of the error\nprobabilities is additive. Since we have the asymptotically optimal tests for\ncomposite hypothesis testing with and without training data, we quantify the\nloss of universality and gain of training data for these models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 19:28:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 18:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-29"}

In this work, we consider multigroup multicast\ntransmission with a common message (e.g., multimedia content), in which\ndifferent multicast groups are interested along with their private multicast\nmessages. We further assume that a relay helps the cellular base station (BS)\ndisseminate multicast content to the users experiencing high path loss and/or\nblockage.

The motivation is\ndistributed control of large networks. As in prior work, the objective function\nis composed of a state cost in the form of Kullback-Leibler divergence plus a\nquadratic control cost. With this choice of objective function, the optimal\nprobability distribution of a population of agents over a finite time horizon\nis shown to be an exponential tilting of the nominal probability distribution.\nThe same is true for the controlled transition matrices that induce the optimal\nprobability distribution. However, one limitation of the previous work is that\nrandomness can only be introduced via the control policy; all uncontrolled\n(natural) processes must be modeled as deterministic to render them immutable\nunder an exponential tilting. In this work, only the controlled dynamics are\nsubject to tilting, allowing for more general probabilistic models.\n  Another advancement is a reduction in complexity based on lossy compression\nusing transform techniques. This is motivated by the need to consider time\nhorizons that are much longer than the inter-sampling times required for\nreliable control. Numerical experiments are performed in a power network\nsetting.

A common belief among\npractitioners is that, for the latest generation of DDR4 systems that are\nprotected by TRR, RowHammer is no longer an issue in practice. However, in\nreality, very little is known about TRR. In this paper, we demystify the inner\nworkings of TRR and debunk its security guarantees.

These insights\nallow us to build TRRespass, a scalable black-box RowHammer fuzzer. TRRespass\nshows that even the latest generation DDR4 chips with in-DRAM TRR, immune to\nall known RowHammer attacks, are often still vulnerable to new TRR-aware\nvariants of RowHammer that we develop. In particular, TRRespass finds that, on\nmodern DDR4 modules, RowHammer is still possible when many aggressor rows are\nused (as many as 19 in some cases), with a method we generally refer to as\nMany-sided RowHammer.

In\nparticular, we formulate the CSs' utility maximization as a non-collaborative\nenergy contract problem in which each CS maximizes its utility under common\nconstraints from the smart grid provider (SGP) and other CSs' contracts. Then,\nwe prove the existence of an equilibrium contract solution for all the CSs and\ndevelop an iterative algorithm at the SGP to find the equilibrium. Through\nsimulation results using the dataset of CSs' transactions in Dundee city, the\nUnited Kingdom between 2017 and 2018, we demonstrate that our proposed method\ncan achieve the energy demand prediction accuracy improvement up to 24.63% and\nlessen communication overhead by 96.3% compared with other machine learning\nalgorithms. Furthermore, our proposed method can outperform non-contract-based\neconomic models by 35% and 36% in terms of the CSs' utilities and social\nwelfare of the network, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2020 01:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

Our system\nconsists of two optomechanical cavities in which two cavity fields are coupled\nto each other via a nondegenerate parametric downconversion. The two cavity\noutput fields are subject to continuous Bell-like homodyne detection and the\ndetection currents are fed back to drive the cavity fields. It is found that\nwhen the feedback is absent, the two mechanical oscillators can only be\nprepared in steady weakly entangled states which however do not display EPR\nsteering and Bell nonlocality, due to the so-called 3 dB limit. But when the\nfeedback is present, it is found that the mechanical entanglement is\nconsiderably enhanced such that strong mechanical steering and Bell nonlocality\ncan be obtained in the steady-state regime. We analytically reveal that this is\nbecause the feedback drives the mechanical oscillators into a steady\napproximate two-mode squeezed vacuum state, with arbitrary squeezing in\nprinciple. It is shown that the feedback can also obviously improve the purity\nof the nonclassical mechanical states. The dependences of the mechanical\nquantum nonlocality on the feedback strength and thermal fluctuations are\nstudied, and it is found that Bell nonlocality is much more vulnerable to\nthermal noise than EPR steerable nonlocality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2020 01:23:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

This letter advances the existing research by proposing and\nanalyzing a double-IRS aided wireless communication system. Under the\nreasonable assumption that the reflection channel from IRS 1 to IRS 2 is of\nrank 1 (e.g., line-of-sight channel), we propose a joint passive beamforming\ndesign for the two IRSs.

We study runtime monitoring of properties expressed in\nLTL on finite traces (LTLf), and in its extension LDLf. LDLf is a powerful\nlogic that captures all monadic second order logic on finite traces, and that\nis obtained by combining regular expressions with LTLf, adopting the syntax of\npropositional dynamic logic (PDL). Interestingly, in spite of its greater\nexpressivity, \\LDLf has exactly the same computational complexity of LTLf.\n  We show that LDLf is able to declaratively express, in the logic itself, not\nonly the constraints to be monitored, but also the de-facto standard RV-LTL\nmonitors. On the one hand, this enables us to directly employ the standard\ncharacterization of LDLf based on finite-state automata to monitor constraints\nin a fine-grained way. On the other hand, it provides the basis for\ndeclaratively expressing sophisticated metaconstraints that predicate on the\nmonitoring state of other constraints, and to check them by relying on standard\nlogical services instead of ad-hoc algorithms.\n  In addition, we devise a direct translation of LDLf formulae into\nnondeterministic finite-state automata, avoiding to detour to Buchi automata or\nalternating automata.

Content Addressable Memories (CAMs) are a form of\nIMC that performs parallel searches for matched entries over a memory array for\na given input query. CAMs are widely used for data-centric applications that\ninvolve pattern matching and search functionality. To accommodate the ever\nexpanding data, it is attractive to resort to analog CAM for memory density\nimprovement. However, the digital CAM design nowadays based on standard CMOS or\nemerging nonvolatile memories (e.g., resistive storage devices) is already\nchallenging due to area, power, and cost penalties. Thus, it can be extremely\nexpensive to achieve analog CAM with those technologies due to added cell\ncomponents. As such, we propose, for the first time, a universal compact FeFET\nbased CAM design, FeCAM, with search and storage functionality enabled in\ndigital and analog domain simultaneously. By exploiting the multi-level-cell\n(MLC) states of FeFET, FeCAM can store and search inputs in either digital or\nanalog domain. We perform a device-circuit co-design of the proposed FeCAM and\nvalidate its functionality and performance using an experimentally calibrated\nFeFET model. Circuit level simulation results demonstrate that FeCAM can either\nstore continuous matching ranges or encode 3-bit data in a single CAM cell.\nWhen compared with the existing digital CMOS based CAM approaches, FeCAM is\nfound to improve both memory density by 22.4X and energy saving by 8.6/3.2X for\nanalog/digital modes, respectively. In the CAM-related application, our\nevaluations show that FeCAM can achieve 60.5X/23.1X saving in area/search\nenergy compared with conventional CMOS based CAMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2020 05:43:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 16:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

This is\ndue to the degradation caused by dense fog particles that break the optical\nflow basic assumptions such as brightness and gradient constancy. To address\nthe problem, we introduce a semi-supervised deep learning technique that\nemploys real fog images without optical flow ground-truths in the training\nprocess. Our network integrates the domain transformation and optical flow\nnetworks in one framework. Initially, given a pair of synthetic fog images, its\ncorresponding clean images and optical flow ground-truths, in one training\nbatch we train our network in a supervised manner. Subsequently, given a pair\nof real fog images and a pair of clean images that are not corresponding to\neach other (unpaired), in the next training batch, we train our network in an\nunsupervised manner. We then alternate the training of synthetic and real data\niteratively. We use real data without ground-truths, since to have\nground-truths in such conditions is intractable, and also to avoid the\noverfitting problem of synthetic data training, where the knowledge learned on\nsynthetic data cannot be generalized to real data testing. Together with the\nnetwork architecture design, we propose a new training strategy that combines\nsupervised synthetic-data training and unsupervised real-data training.\nExperimental results show that our method is effective and outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods in estimating optical flow in dense foggy scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2020 10:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

The receiver, only seeing the message\nbut not the state, decides either to stop the game, or to continue which takes\nthe game to the next period. The payoff to each player is a function of the\nstate when the receiver quits, with higher states leading to better payoffs.\nThe horizon of the game can be finite or infinite.\n  We prove existence and uniqueness of responsive (i.e. non-babbling) Perfect\nBayesian Equilibrium (PBE) under mild conditions on the game primitives in the\ncase where the players are sufficiently patient.

In this study, by connecting stocks with illiquidity comovements, an\nilliquidity network is established to model the market.

In this paper, we systematically\ninvestigate the impact of different subbands and their importance on replay\nspoofing detection on two benchmark datasets: ASVspoof 2017 v2.0 and ASVspoof\n2019 PA. We propose a joint subband modelling framework that employs n\ndifferent sub-networks to learn subband specific features. These are later\ncombined and passed to a classifier and the whole network weights are updated\nduring training. Our findings on the ASVspoof 2017 dataset suggest that the\nmost discriminative information appears to be in the first and the last 1 kHz\nfrequency bands, and the joint model trained on these two subbands shows the\nbest performance outperforming the baselines by a large margin. However, these\nfindings do not generalise on the ASVspoof 2019 PA dataset. This suggests that\nthe datasets available for training these models do not reflect real world\nreplay conditions suggesting a need for careful design of datasets for training\nreplay spoofing countermeasures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2020 12:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

A multivariate depth function is a function\nwhich, given a point and a distribution in d-space, measures centrality by a\nnumber between 0 and 1, while satisfying certain postulates regarding\ninvariance, monotonicity, convexity and continuity. Accordingly, numerous\nnotions of multivariate depth have been proposed in the literature, some of\nwhich are also robust against extremely outlying data. The departure from\nclassical Mahalanobis distance does not come without cost. There is a trade-off\nbetween invariance, robustness and computational feasibility. In the last few\nyears, efficient exact algorithms as well as approximate ones have been\nconstructed and made available in R-packages. Consequently, in practical\napplications the choice of a depth statistic is no more restricted to one or\ntwo notions due to computational limits; rather often more notions are\nfeasible, among which the researcher has to decide. The article debates\ntheoretical and practical aspects of this choice, including invariance and\nuniqueness, robustness and computational feasibility.

In light of this, we\npropose an efficient disentangled representation learning for cross-domain face\nPAD. Our approach consists of disentangled representation learning (DR-Net) and\nmulti-domain learning (MD-Net). DR-Net learns a pair of encoders via generative\nmodels that can disentangle PAD informative features from subject\ndiscriminative features. The disentangled features from different domains are\nfed to MD-Net which learns domain-independent features for the final\ncross-domain face PAD task.

Despite success in applications\nsuch as machine translation and voice recognition, these stateful models have\nseveral critical shortcomings. Specifically, RNNs generalize poorly over very\nlong sequences, which limits their applicability to many important temporal\nprocessing and time series forecasting problems. For example, RNNs struggle in\nrecognizing complex context free languages (CFLs), never reaching 100% accuracy\non training. One way to address these shortcomings is to couple an RNN with an\nexternal, differentiable memory structure, such as a stack. However,\ndifferentiable memories in prior work have neither been extensively studied on\nCFLs nor tested on sequences longer than those seen in training. The few\nefforts that have studied them have shown that continuous differentiable memory\nstructures yield poor generalization for complex CFLs, making the RNN less\ninterpretable.
