Patch leaving is a canonical foraging behavior, but classic\ntheoretical conceptions of patch leaving decisions lack some key naturalistic\ndetails. Optimal foraging theory provides general rules for when an animal\nshould leave a patch, but does not provide mechanistic insights about how those\nrules change with the structure of the environment. Such a mechanistic\nframework would aid in designing quantitative experiments to unravel behavioral\nand neural underpinnings of foraging. To address these shortcomings, we develop\na normative theory of patch foraging decisions. Using a Bayesian approach, we\ntreat patch leaving behavior as a statistical inference problem. We derive the\nanimals' optimal decision strategies in both non-depleting and depleting\nenvironments. A majority of these cases can be analyzed explicitly using\nmethods from stochastic processes. Our behavioral predictions are expressed in\nterms of the optimal patch residence time and the decision rule by which an\nanimal departs a patch. We also extend our theory to a hierarchical model in\nwhich the forager learns the environmental food resource distribution. The\nquantitative framework we develop will therefore help experimenters move from\nanalyzing trial based behavior to continuous behavior without the loss of\nquantitative rigor. Our theoretical framework both extends optimal foraging\ntheory and motivates a variety of behavioral and neuroscientific experiments\ninvestigating patch foraging behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 16:09:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-23"}

For instance, in the realm of exoplanet detection with radial\nvelocity time series, stellar variability can induce false detections. However,\na white noise approximation is often used because accounting for correlated\nnoise when analyzing data implies a more complex analysis. Moreover, the\ncomputational cost can be prohibitive as it typically scales as the cube of the\ndataset size.\n  For some restricted classes of correlated noise models, there are specific\nalgorithms that can be used to help bring down the computational cost. This\nimprovement in speed is particularly useful in the context of Gaussian process\nregression, however, it comes at the expense of the generality of the noise\nmodel.\n  Here, we present the S+LEAF noise model, which allows us to account for a\nlarge class of correlated noises with a linear scaling of the computational\ncost with respect to the size of the dataset. The S+LEAF model includes, in\nparticular, mixtures of quasiperiodic kernels and calibration noise. This\nefficient modeling is made possible by a sparse representation of the\ncovariance matrix of the noise and the use of dedicated algorithms for matrix\ninversion, solving, determinant computation, etc.\n  We applied the S+LEAF model to reanalyze the HARPS radial velocity time\nseries of HD 136352. We illustrate the flexibility of the S+LEAF model in\nhandling various sources of noise. We demonstrate the importance of taking\ncorrelated noise into account, and especially calibration noise, to correctly\nassess the significance of detected signals.\n  We provide an open-source implementation of the S+LEAF model, available at\nhttps://gitlab.unige.ch/jean-baptiste.delisle/spleaf.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 16:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Usually a\npenalization term added to momentum equation provides to get material\ndistribution. Every time material is added inside the computational domain,\nthere is creation of new fluid-solid interfaces and apparition of gradient of\nporosity. However, at present, porosity variation is not taken account in\ntopology optimization and the penalization term used to locate the solid is\nanalogous to a Darcy term used for flows in porous media. With that in mind, in\nthis paper, we first develop an original one-domain macroscopic model for the\nmodelling of flow through spatially varying porous media that goes beyond the\nscope of Darcy regime. Next, we numerically solve a topology optimization\nproblem and compare the results obtained with the standard model that does not\ninclude effect of porosity variation with those obtained with our model.

Such experiments can indeed\ncomplement observations by providing access to the processes with spatial and\ntemporal resolution. A first step has been made in [G. Revet et al., Science\nAdvances 3, e1700982 (2017), arXiv:1708.02528]. in allowing such\ninvestigations. It revealed the existence of a two components stream: a hot\nshell surrounding a cooler inner stream. The shell was formed by matter\nlaterally ejected upon impact and refocused by the local magnetic field. That\nlaboratory investigation was limited tonormal incidence impacts. However, in\nyoung stellar objects, complex structure of magnetic fields causes variability\nof the incidentangles of the accretion columns. This led us to undertake an\ninvestigation, using laboratory plasmas, of the consequence of having a slanted\naccretion impacting a young star. Here we use high power laser interactions and\nstrong magnetic field generation in the laboratory, complemented by numerical\nsimulations, to study the asymmetry induced upon accretion structures when\ncolumns of matter impact the surface of young stars with an oblique angle.\nCompared to the scenario where matter accretes normal to the star surface, we\nobserve strongly asymmetric plasma structure, strong lateral ejecta of matter,\npoor confinement of the accreted material and reduced heating compared to the\nnormal incidence case. Thus, slanted accretion is a configuration that seems to\nbe capable of inducing perturbations of the chromosphere and hence possibly\ninfluence the level of activity of the corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 17:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

After cleaning the light curve from the\nstellar pulsations, we confidently report a secondary eclipse depth of 305.8\n+/- 35.5 parts-per-million (ppm), along with an amplitude of the phase curve of\n100.4 +/- 13.1 ppm and a corresponding westward offset between the region of\nmaximum brightness and the substellar point of 28.7 +/- 7.1 degrees, making\nWASP-33b one of the few planets with such an offset found so far. Our derived\nBond albedo, A_B = 0.369 +/- 0.050, and heat recirculation efficiency, epsilon\n= 0.189 +/- 0.014, confirm again that he behavior of WASP-33b is similar to\nthat of other hot Jupiters, despite the high irradiation received from its host\nstar. By connecting the amplitude of the phase curve to the primary transit and\ndepths of the secondary eclipse, we determine that the day- and nightside\nbrightness temperatures of WASP-33b are 3014 +/- 60 K and 1605 +/- 45 K,\nrespectively. From the detection of photometric variations due to gravitational\ninteractions, we estimate a planet mass of M_P = 2.81 +/- 0.53 M$_J.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 18:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 09:05:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

We use\nthe [CII]158um luminosity, recently proposed as a molecular gas tracer, to\nestimate the molecular gas content in a large sample of main-sequence\nstar-forming galaxies at z=4.4-5.9, with a median stellar mass of 10^9.7 Msun,\ndrawn from the ALMA Large Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early times (ALPINE)\nsurvey. The agreement between molecular gas masses derived from [CII]\nluminosity, dynamical mass, and rest-frame 850um luminosity, extrapolated from\nthe rest-frame 158um continuum, supports [CII] as a reliable tracer of\nmolecular gas in our sample. We find a continuous decline of the molecular gas\ndepletion timescale from z=0 to z=5.9, which reaches a mean value of\n(4.6+/-0.8)x10^8 yr at z~5.5, only a factor of 2-3 shorter than in present-day\ngalaxies. This suggests a mild enhancement of star formation efficiency toward\nhigh redshifts, unless the molecular gas fraction significantly increases. Our\nestimates show that the rise in molecular gas fraction as reported previously,\nflattens off above z~3.7 to achieve a mean value of 63%+/-3 over z=4.4-5.9.\nThis redshift evolution of the gas fraction is in line with the one of the\nspecific star formation rate. We use multi-epoch abundance matching to follow\nthe gas fraction evolution over cosmic time of progenitors of z=0 Milky\nWay-like galaxies in 10^13 Msun halos and of more massive z=0 galaxies in 10^14\nMsun halos. Interestingly, the former progenitors show a monotonic decrease of\nthe gas fraction with cosmic time, while the latter show a constant gas\nfraction from z=5.9 to z~2 and a decrease at z<2.

The second part of the paper is devoted to various\napplications to shape optimization. The main theme is studying sharp\nisoperimetric inequalities for Steklov eigenvalues without any assumption on\nthe number of connected components of the boundary. In particular, we solve the\nisoperimetric problem for each Steklov eigenvalue of planar domains: the best\nupper bound for the $k$-th perimeter-normalised Steklov eigenvalue is\n$8{\\pi}k$, which is the best upper bound for the $k$-th area-normalised\neigenvalue of the Laplacian on the sphere. The proof involves realising a\nweighted Neumann problem as a limit of Steklov problems on perforated domains.\nFor $k = 1$, the number of connected boundary components of a maximizing\nsequence must tend to infinity, and we provide a quantitative lower bound on\nthe number of connected components. A surprising consequence of our analysis is\nthat any maximizing sequence of planar domains with fixed perimeter must\ncollapse to a point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 18:36:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 17:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

In the\npreliminary results, a literature review covering 1970-2018 identified 29\noriginal counting methods.

The internal and external\nvalidation of the counting methods are assessed. Three criteria for\nwell-constructed bibliometric indicators - adequacy, sensitivity, and\nhomogeneity - are used to assess the internal validity. Regarding the external\nvalidation of the counting methods, it is investigated whether the intentions\nin the studies that introduced the 29 counting methods comply with the\nsubsequent use of the counting methods.

We have developed a tool that allows the\nuser to improve the accuracy of standard lithium abundance determinations based\non 1D model atmospheres and the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium\n(LTE) by applying corrections that account for hydrodynamic (3D) and non-LTE\n(NLTE) effects in FGK stars of different metallicity. Based on a grid of\nCO5BOLD 3D models and associated 1D hydrostatic atmospheres, we computed three\nlibraries of synthetic spectra of the lithium line at 670.8 nm for a wide range\nof lithium abundances, accounting for detailed line formation in 3D NLTE, 1D\nNLTE, and 1D LTE, respectively. The resulting curves-of-growth were then used\nto derive 3D NLTE and 1D NLTE lithium abundance corrections. We demonstrate\nthat 3D and NLTE effects are small for metal-poor stars on the Spite plateau,\nleading to errors of at most +/-0.05 dex if ignored. The largest corrections\nare found at the coolest effective temperature, Teff=5000 K, where they can\nreach -0.4 dex for the strongest lines. We present analytical functions for\nevaluating the corrections and for directly converting a given lithium\nabundance into an equivalent width, or vice versa, a given equivalent width\n(EW) into a lithium abundance. For convenience, a Python script is made\navailable that evaluates all fitting functions for given Teff, log g, [Fe/H],\nand A(Li) or EW.

The spectral response and dynamics of\nTiN and ZrN are only weakly sensitive to pump fluence and pump excitation\nenergy.

The classical mechanisms\nfor assigning students to schools do not naturally address problems like school\nsegregation and class diversity, which have worsened over the years.

Plausibly Deniable\nEncryption (PDE) systems provide an effective manner to protect sensitive data\nby hiding them on the device. However, existing PDE systems can lose data due\nto overriding the hidden volume, waste physical storage because of the reserved\narea used for avoiding data loss, and require device reboot when using the\nhidden volume. This paper presents MobiGyges, a hidden volume-based mobile PDE\nsystem, to fill the gap. MobiGyges addresses the problem of data loss by\nrestricting each storage block used only by one volume, and it improves storage\nutilization by eliminating the reserved area. MobiGyges can also avoid device\nreboot by mounting the hidden volume dynamically on-demand with the Dynamic\nMounting service. Moreover, we identify two novel PDE oriented attacks, the\ncapacity comparison attack and the fill-to-full attack. MobiGyges can defend\nthem by jointly leveraging the Shrunk U-disk method and multi-level\ndeniability. We implement the MobiGyges proof-of-concept system on a real\nmobile phone Google Nexus 6P with LineageOS 13.

Each wave realization is typically characterized by a\nhigh-dimensional input time series, and a reliable determination of the extreme\nevents is associated with substantial computational effort. As the sea depth\ndecreases, extreme events become more difficult to evaluate. We here construct\na low-dimensional characterization of the candidate input time series to\ncircumvent the search for extreme wave events in a high-dimensional input\nprobability space. Each wave input is represented by a unique low-dimensional\nset of parameters for which standard surrogate approximations, such as Gaussian\nprocesses, can estimate the short-term exceedance probability efficiently and\naccurately.

We determine a few scenarios for\nthe estimated dose limit at 1 and 20mSv, corresponding to the effective dose\nlimit for the general public and occupational exposure, respectively, as well\nas a higher dose induced an extreme superflare. We set a hypothetical airline\nshutdown scenario at 1mSv for a single flight per passenger, due to legal\nrestrictions under the potential radiation dose. In such a scenario, we\ncalculate the potential loss in direct and opportunity cost under the\ncancelation of the flight. At the same time, we considered that, even under\nsuch a scenario, if the airplane flies at a slightly lower altitude (from 12 to\n9.5km: atmospheric depth from 234 to 365g/cm$^{2}$), the total loss becomes\nmuch smaller than flight cancelation, and the estimated total dose goes down\nfrom 1.2 to 0.45mSv, which is below the effective dose limit for the general\npublic. In case of flying at an even lower altitude (7km: atmospheric depth\n484g/cm$^{2}$), the estimated total dose becomes much smaller, 0.12 mSv. If we\nassume the increase of fuel cost is proportional to the increase in atmospheric\ndepth, the increase in cost becomes 1.56 and 2.07 for the case of flying at 9.5\nkm and at 7 km, respectively. Lower altitude flights provide more safety for\nthe potential risk of radiation doses induced by severe SPEs. At the same time,\nsince there is total loss caused by flight cancelation, we propose that\nconsidering lower flight altitude is the best protection against solar flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 21:24:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

To strike a well balance between exploration and exploitation,\nit is attractive to have an adaptive operator selection (AOS) mechanism that\nautomatically chooses the most appropriate operator on the fly according to the\ncurrent status. This paper proposes a new AOS mechanism for multi-objective\nevolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). More specifically, the\nAOS is formulated as a multi-armed bandit problem where the dynamic Thompson\nsampling (DYTS) is applied to adapt the bandit learning model, originally\nproposed with an assumption of a fixed award distribution, to a non-stationary\nsetup. In particular, each arm of our bandit learning model represents a\nreproduction operator and is assigned with a prior reward distribution. The\nparameters of these reward distributions will be progressively updated\naccording to the performance of its performance collected from the evolutionary\nprocess. When generating an offspring, an operator is chosen by sampling from\nthose reward distribution according to the DYTS. Experimental results fully\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed AOS mechanism\ncompared with other four state-of-the-art MOEA/D variants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 21:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-24"}

The core problem of\nlong-range planning is finding an efficient way to search through the tree of\npossible action sequences. Existing non-learned planning solutions from the\nTask and Motion Planning (TAMP) literature rely on the existence of logical\ndescriptions for the effects and preconditions for actions. This constraint\nallows TAMP methods to efficiently reduce the tree search problem but limits\ntheir ability to generalize to unseen and complex physical environments. In\ncontrast, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods use flexible\nneural-network-based function approximators to discover policies that\ngeneralize naturally to unseen circumstances. However, DRL methods struggle to\nhandle the very sparse reward landscapes inherent to long-range multi-step\nplanning situations. Here, we propose the Curious Sample Planner (CSP), which\nfuses elements of TAMP and DRL by combining a curiosity-guided sampling\nstrategy with imitation learning to accelerate planning. We show that CSP can\nefficiently discover interesting and complex temporally-extended plans for\nsolving a wide range of physically realistic 3D tasks. In contrast, standard\nplanning and learning methods often fail to solve these tasks at all or do so\nonly with a huge and highly variable number of training samples. We explore the\nuse of a variety of curiosity metrics with CSP and analyze the types of\nsolutions that CSP discovers. Finally, we show that CSP supports task transfer\nso that the exploration policies learned during experience with one task can\nhelp improve efficiency on related tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 21:47:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 06:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

This enables a more\nautomated and real-time localization of bugs in P4 programs using software\ntesting techniques like Tarantula. Once the bug in a P4 program is localized,\nthe faulty code can be patched due to the programmable nature of P4. In\naddition, platform-dependent bugs can be detected. From P4_14 to P4_16 (latest\nversion), our observation is that as the programmable blocks increase, the\npatchability of P4 programs increases accordingly.

We have\nunlabeled observations coming from multiple linear regressions, and each\nobservation corresponds to exactly one of the regression models. The goal is to\nlearn the linear regressors from the observations. Classically, Alternating\nMinimization (AM) (which is a variant of Expectation Maximization (EM)) is used\nto solve this problem. AM iteratively alternates between the estimation of\nlabels and solving the regression problems with the estimated labels.\nEmpirically, it is observed that, for a large variety of non-convex problems\nincluding mixed linear regression, AM converges at a much faster rate compared\nto gradient based algorithms. However, the existing theory suggests similar\nrate of convergence for AM and gradient based methods, failing to capture this\nempirical behavior. In this paper, we close this gap between theory and\npractice for the special case of a mixture of $2$ linear regressions.

The growth of model size poses a key\nenergy efficiency challenge for the underlying computing platform. Thus, model\ncompression becomes a crucial problem. However, the current approaches are\nlimited by various drawbacks. Specifically, network sparsification approach\nsuffers from irregularity, heuristic nature and large indexing overhead. On the\nother hand, the recent structured matrix-based approach (i.e., CirCNN) is\nlimited by the relatively complex arithmetic computation (i.e., FFT), less\nflexible compression ratio, and its inability to fully utilize input sparsity.\nTo address these drawbacks, this paper proposes PermDNN, a novel approach to\ngenerate and execute hardware-friendly structured sparse DNN models using\npermuted diagonal matrices. Compared with unstructured sparsification approach,\nPermDNN eliminates the drawbacks of indexing overhead, non-heuristic\ncompression effects and time-consuming retraining. Compared with circulant\nstructure-imposing approach, PermDNN enjoys the benefits of higher reduction in\ncomputational complexity, flexible compression ratio, simple arithmetic\ncomputation and full utilization of input sparsity. We propose PermDNN\narchitecture, a multi-processing element (PE) fully-connected (FC)\nlayer-targeted computing engine. The entire architecture is highly scalable and\nflexible, and hence it can support the needs of different applications with\ndifferent model configurations. We implement a 32-PE design using CMOS 28nm\ntechnology. Compared with EIE, PermDNN achieves 3.3x~4.8x higher throughout,\n5.9x~8.5x better area efficiency and 2.8x~4.0x better energy efficiency on\ndifferent workloads.

In general, these methods work by selecting the best instance from a\npool of candidates and then aggregating other instances based on similarity.

However, they\nare behind in accuracy comparing with recent segmentation-based text detectors.\nIn this work, we discover that one important reason to this case is that\nregression-based methods usually utilize a fixed feature selection way, i.e.\nselecting features in a single location or in neighbor regions, to predict\ncomponents of the bounding box, such as the distances to the boundaries or the\nrotation angle. The features selected through this way sometimes are not the\nbest choices for predicting every component of a text bounding box and thus\ndegrade the accuracy performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nLocation-Aware feature Selection text detection Network (LASNet). LASNet\nselects suitable features from different locations to separately predict the\nfive components of a bounding box and gets the final bounding box through the\ncombination of these components. Specifically, instead of using the\nclassification score map to select one feature for predicting the whole\nbounding box as most of the existing methods did, the proposed LASNet first\nlearn five new confidence score maps to indicate the prediction accuracy of the\nbounding box components, respectively. Then, a Location-Aware Feature Selection\nmechanism (LAFS) is designed to weightily fuse the top-$K$ prediction results\nfor each component according to their confidence score, and to combine the all\nfive fused components into a final bounding box. As a result, LASNet predicts\nthe more accurate bounding boxes by using a learnable feature selection way.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that our LASNet achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with single-model and single-scale testing, outperforming all\nexisting regression-based detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 06:45:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 02:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

Truncating the space dimension is unavoidable,\nand it can lead to incorrect results if the gates populate photon number states\nbeyond the cutoff. To tackle this issue, we present an algorithm that is orders\nof magnitude faster than the current state of the art, to recursively compute\nthe exact matrix elements of Gaussian operators and their gradient with respect\nto a parametrization. These operators, when augmented with a non-Gaussian\ntransformation such as the Kerr gate, achieve universal quantum computation.\nOur approach brings two advantages: first, by computing the matrix elements of\nGaussian operators directly, we don't need to construct them by combining\nseveral other operators; second, we can use any variant of the gradient descent\nalgorithm by plugging our gradients into an automatic differentiation framework\nsuch as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

However, in practice, the performance of QKD is limited by\n\"practical imperfections\" in realistic sources, channels, and detectors (such\nas multi-photon components or imperfect encoding from the sources, losses and\nmisalignment in the channels, or dark counts in detectors). Addressing such\npractical imperfections is a crucial part of implementing QKD protocols with\ngood performance in reality. There are two highly important future directions\nfor QKD: (1) QKD over free space, which can allow secure communications between\nmobile platforms such as handheld systems, drones, planes, and even satellites,\nand (2) fibre-based QKD networks, which can simultaneously provide QKD service\nto numerous users at arbitrary locations. These directions are both highly\npromising, but so far they are limited by practical imperfections in the\nchannels and devices, which pose huge challenges and limit their performance.\nIn this thesis, we develop adaptive techniques with innovative protocol and\nalgorithm design, as well as novel techniques such as machine learning, to\naddress some of these key challenges, including (a) atmospheric turbulence in\nchannels for free-space QKD, (b) asymmetric losses in channels for QKD network,\nand (c) efficient parameter optimization in real time, which is important for\nboth free-space QKD and QKD networks. We believe that this work will pave the\nway to important implementations of free-space QKD and fibre-based QKD networks\nin the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 07:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-24"}

Unexpectedly, we observe a planetary relationship of the daily\nstratospheric temperature distribution. Its spectral shape does not match\nconcurrent solar activity, or solar EUV emission, whose impact on the\natmosphere is unequivocal. This behavior points at an additional energy source\nof exosolar origin. A viable concept behind such observations is based on\npossible gravitational focusing by the solar system towards the Earth of low\nspeed invisible matter. We denote generic constituents from the dark Universe\nas invisible matter, in order to distinguish them from ordinary dark matter\ncandidates like axions or WIMPs, which cannot have any noticeable impact on the\nstratosphere. The observed peaking planetary relations exclude on their own any\nconventional explanation. Only a somehow strongly interacting invisible\nstreaming matter with the little screened upper stratosphere (noverhead about 1\ngr/cm 2) can be behind the occasionally observed temperature increases. We also\nestimate an associated energy deposition O(W/m 2), which is variable over the\n11 years solar cycle.

These\nobservations, however, mostly detect the secondary cosmic rays (SCRs) such as\nneutron, muon, and gamma. It is well known that the atmospheric pressure plays\nan important role in the SCR flux observed on the ground. Barometric pressure\ncorrection is standard practice for neutron monitor (NM) data. However, no such\ncorrection is applied to gamma-ray, being massless. But the pressure affects\nthe particles such as $e^{\\pm}$, $\\mu^{\\pm}$, which produce gamma rays in the\ncascade. Subsequently, the indirect pressure dependence of the gamma-ray flux\ncan be anticipated.\n  We examine this aspect in detail by studying the gamma-ray counts detected by\nthe NaI (Tl) detector. The present study confirms that there is no correlation\nbetween the atmospheric pressure and the total gamma-ray counts collected from\nall energies. However, the scenario differs when the gamma-ray fluxes of\ndifferent energies are investigated separately. The gamma rays of energy below\n$\\sim$3 MeV are primarily due to the radioactivity originating from the ground,\nwhereas gamma rays above 3 MeV are mainly produced in the CR cascade. It is\nobserved that the counts of energy above 3 MeV are well anti-correlated with\nthe atmospheric pressure and hence need to be corrected. It is demonstrated\nthat applying the barometric correction formula successfully removes the\npressure dependence in the gamma-ray flux above 3 MeV. Therefore, we suggest\nthat the gamma-ray data above 3 MeV needs to be corrected for the local\natmospheric pressure variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 07:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

Considering the multiplier design problem, for example, the 5x5-bit\nmultiplier represents the most complex circuit evolved from a randomly\ngenerated initial population. The efficiency of CGP highly depends on the\nperformance of the point mutation operator, however, this operator is purely\nstochastic. This contrasts with the recent developments in Genetic Programming\n(GP), where advanced informed approaches such as semantic-aware operators are\nincorporated to improve the search space exploration capability of GP. In this\npaper, we propose a semantically-oriented mutation operator (SOMO) suitable for\nthe evolutionary design of combinational circuits. SOMO uses semantics to\ndetermine the best value for each mutated gene. Compared to the common CGP and\nits variants as well as the recent versions of Semantic GP, the proposed method\nconverges on common Boolean benchmarks substantially faster while keeping the\nphenotype size relatively small.

The syntactical information of programs can be represented in the\nfrom of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples. Using the BOLD framework,\nthe programs can be automatically instrumented by using declarative\nspecifications over these triples. A salient feature of the framework is to\nstore the execution trace of the program also as RDF triples called\n\\textit{trace triples}. These triples can be queried to implement the common\ndebug operations. The novelty of the framework is to abstract these triples as\n\\textit{spans} for high-level reasoning.

A notable feature of using ontology is that users can\naccurately debug in some cases of missing information, which can be practically\nuseful.

Charge-conjugation (particle-hole) symmetry is conserved\nif hopping is only allowed between the two sublattices of even and odd sites.\nIn this case (of BDI symmetry) we find a variety of topologically non-trivial\nphases, characterized by different numbers of edge states (or, equivalently,\ndifferent quantized Zak phases).

We study specifically next-nearest-neighbor hopping\nwith amplitudes $t_a$ and $t_b$ for the $A$ and $B$ sublattices, respectively.\nFor $t_a=t_b$ parity is conserved, and also the quantized Zak phases remain\nunchanged in the gapped regions of the phase diagram. However, metallic patches\nappear due to the overlap between conduction and valence bands in some regions\nof parameter space. The case of alternating next-nearest neighbor hopping,\n$t_a=-t_b$, is also remarkable, as it breaks both charge-conjugation $C$ and\nparity $P$ but conserves the product $CP$.

These studies led us to assume that\ncoupling both components of the two-fluid model instead of using the VFM to\ndescribe the superfluid component enables us to approximate the system. In this\nstudy, we formulated a new SPH model that simultaneously solves both equations\nof motion of the two-fluid model.

The results showed that the two major\nphenomena, the emergence of multiple independent vortices parallel to the\ncircular axis and that of the so-called rigid-body rotation, can be reproduced\nby solving the two-fluid model using SPH. This finding is interesting because\nit was previously assumed that only a single vortex emerges when addressing\nsimilar problems without considering quantum mechanics. Our further analysis\nfound that the emergence of multiple independent vortices can be realized by\nreformulating the viscosity term of the two-fluid model to conserve the angular\nmomentum of the particles around their axes.

Every proper quotient of a\n$\\frac{3}{2}$-generated group is cyclic, and in 2008, Breuer, Guralnick and\nKantor made the striking conjecture that this condition alone provides a\ncomplete characterisation of the finite groups with this property. This\nconjecture has recently been reduced to the almost simple groups and results of\nPiccard (1939) and Woldar (1994) show that the conjecture is true for almost\nsimple groups whose socles are alternating or sporadic groups. Therefore, the\ncentral focus is now on the almost simple groups of Lie type.\n  In this monograph we prove a strong version of this conjecture for almost\nsimple classical groups, building on earlier work of Burness and Guest (2013)\nand the author (2017). More precisely, we show that every relevant almost\nsimple classical group has uniform spread at least two, unless it is isomorphic\nto the symmetric group of degree six. We also prove that the uniform spread of\nthese groups tends to infinity if the size of the underlying field tends to\ninfinity.\n  To prove these results, we are guided by a probabilistic approach introduced\nby Guralnick and Kantor.

Full memory encryption for Virtual Machines (VM) protects\nagainst curious cloud providers as well as otherwise compromised hypervisors.\nAMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is the most prevalent hardware-based\nfull memory encryption for VMs. Its newest extension, SEV-ES, also protects the\nentire VM state during context switches, aiming to ensure that the host neither\nlearns anything about the data that is processed inside the VM, nor is able to\nmodify its execution state. Several previous works have analyzed the security\nof SEV and have shown that, by controlling I/O, it is possible to exfiltrate\ndata or even gain control over the VM's execution. In this work, we introduce\ntwo new methods that allow us to inject arbitrary code into SEV-ES secured\nvirtual machines. Due to the lack of proper integrity protection, it is\nsufficient to reuse existing ciphertext to build a high-speed encryption\noracle. As a result, our attack no longer depends on control over the I/O,\nwhich is needed by prior attacks. As I/O manipulation is highly detectable, our\nattacks are stealthier.

This led to the definition of Ma{\\~n}{\\'e} genericity: a property\nis generic if, given a Hamiltonian H, the set of potentials u such that H + u\nsatisfies the property is generic. This notion is mostly used in the context of\nHamiltonians which are convex in p, in the sense that $\\partial$ 2 pp H is\npositive definite at each points. We will also restrict our study to this\nsituation. There is a close relation between perturbations of Hamiltonians by a\nsmall additive potential and perturbations by a positive factor close to one.\nIndeed, the Hamiltonians H + u and H/(1 -- u) have the same level one energy\nsurface, hence their dynamics on this energy surface are reparametrisation of\neach other, this is the Maupertuis principle. This remark is particularly\nrelevant when H is homogeneous in the fibers (which corresponds to Finsler\nmetrics) or even fiberwise quadratic (which corresponds to Riemannian metrics).\nIn these cases, perturbations by potentials of the Hamiltonian correspond, up\nto parametrisation, to conformal perturbations of the metric. One of the widely\nstudied aspects is to understand to what extent the return map associated to a\nperiodic orbit can be perturbed by adding a small potential. This kind of\nquestion depend strongly on the context in which they are posed. Some of the\nmost studied contexts are, in increasing order of difficulty, perturbations of\ngeneral vector fields, perturbations of Hamiltonian systems inside the class of\nHamiltonian systems, perturbations of Riemannian metrics inside the class of\nRiemannian metrics, Ma{\\~n}{\\'e} perturbations of convex Hamiltonians. It is\nfor example well-known that each vector field can be perturbed to a vector\nfield with only hyperbolic periodic orbits, this is part of the Kupka-Smale\ntheorem, see [5, 13]. There is no such result in the context of Hamiltonian\nvector fields, but it remains true that each Hamiltonian can be perturbed to a\nHamiltonian with only non-degenerate periodic orbits (including the iterated\nones), see [11, 12]. The same result is true in the context of Riemannian\nmetrics: every Riemannian metric can be perturbed to a Riemannian metric with\nonly non-degenerate closed geodesics, this is the bumpy metric theorem, see [4,\n2, 1]. The question was investigated only much more recently in the context of\nMa{\\~n}{\\'e} perturbations of convex Hamiltonians, see [9, 10]. It is proved in\n[10] that the same result holds : If H is a convex Hamiltonian and a is a\nregular value of H, then there exist arbitrarily small potentials u such that\nall periodic orbits (including iterated ones) of H + u at energy a are\nnon-degenerate. The proof given in [10] is actually rather similar to the ones\ngiven in papers on the perturbations of Riemannian metrics. In all these\nproofs, it is very useful to work\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 12:22:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 11:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-07"}

The huge development in the field of\nmagnetic skyrmions and other noncollinear magnetic structures is largely due to\nour understanding of the chiral Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Recently,\nvarious works have proposed new types of chiral interactions, with seemingly\ndifferent forms, but the big picture is still missing. Here, we present a\nsystematic construction of a generalized spin model containing isotropic and\nchiral multi-site interactions. These are motivated by a microscopic model that\nincorporates local spin moments and the spin-orbit interaction, and their\nsymmetry properties are established. We show that the chiral interactions arise\nsolely from the spin-orbit interaction and that the multi-site interactions do\nnot have to follow Moriya's rules, unlike the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and chiral\nbiquadratic interactions. The chiral multi-site interactions do not vanish due\nto inversion symmetry, and comply with a generalized Moriya rule: If all sites\nconnected by the interaction lie in the same mirror plane, the chiral\ninteraction vector must be perpendicular to this plane. We then illustrate our\ntheoretical considerations with density functional theory calculations for\nprototypical magnetic systems. These are triangular trimers built out of Cr,\nMn, Fe and Co adatoms on the Re(0001), Pt(111) and Au(111) surfaces, for which\n$C_\\mathrm{3v}$ symmetry applies, and Cr and Fe square tetramers on Pt(001)\nwith $C_\\mathrm{4v}$ symmetry. The multi-site interactions are substantial in\nmagnitude and cannot be neglected when comparing the energy of different\nmagnetic structures. Finally, we discuss the recent literature in light of our\nfindings, and clarify several unclear or confusing points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 12:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

In this paper, we\nreview a variety of methods for producing gradient-based saliency maps, and\npresent a new adversarial training method we developed to make DNNs robust to\ninput noise, with the goal of improving interpretability. We introduce two\nquantitative evaluation procedures for saliency map methods in fMRI, applicable\nwhenever a DNN or linear model is being trained to decode some information from\nimaging data. We evaluate the procedures using a synthetic dataset where the\ncomplex activation structure is known, and on saliency maps produced for DNN\nand linear models for task decoding in the Human Connectome Project (HCP)\ndataset. Our key finding is that saliency maps produced with different methods\nvary widely in interpretability, in both in synthetic and HCP fMRI data.\nStrikingly, even when DNN and linear models decode at comparable levels of\nperformance, DNN saliency maps score higher on interpretability than linear\nmodel saliency maps (derived via weights or gradient). Finally, saliency maps\nproduced with our adversarial training method outperform those from other\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 12:56:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 16:15:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 16:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

Yet, we know little about rate and genomic\ntargets of cross-lineage gene transfer, and about its effects on the recipient\norganism's physiology and fitness. Here, we address these questions in a\nparallel evolution experiment with two Bacillus subtilis lineages of 7%\nsequence divergence. We observe rapid evolution of hybrid organisms: gene\ntransfer swaps ~12% of the core genome in just 200 generations, and 60% of core\ngenes are replaced in at least one population. By genomics, transcriptomics,\nfitness assays, and statistical modeling, we show that transfer generates\nadaptive evolution and functional alterations in hybrids. Specifically, our\nexperiments reveal a strong, repeatable fitness increase of evolved populations\nin the stationary growth phase. By genomic analysis of the transfer statistics\nacross replicate populations, we infer that selection on HGT has a broad\ngenetic basis: 40% of the observed transfers are adaptive. At the level of\nfunctional gene networks, we find signatures of negative and positive\nselection, consistent with hybrid incompatibilities and adaptive evolution of\nnetwork functions. Our results suggest that gene transfer navigates a complex\ncross-lineage fitness landscape, bridging epistatic barriers along multiple\nhigh-fitness paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 13:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

Leveraging\nspectrum distortions of transmitted RF signals, caused by transceiver hardware\nimpairments created during manufacture and assembly stages, to provide device\nclassification has been the focus of many recent works. These prior works\nessentially apply deep learning to extract features of the devices from their\nhardware-impaired signals and rely on feature variations across the devices to\ndistinguish devices from one another. As technology advances, the manufacturing\nimpairment variations across devices are becoming extremely insignificant,\nmaking these prior classification approaches inaccurate.

Related works have been recognized by the\nNeurIPS Test-of-Time award in 2017 and the ICML Best Paper Finalist in 2019.\nThe body of work on random features has grown rapidly, and hence it is\ndesirable to have a comprehensive overview on this topic explaining the\nconnections among various algorithms and theoretical results. In this survey,\nwe systematically review the work on random features from the past ten years.\nFirst, the motivations, characteristics and contributions of representative\nrandom features based algorithms are summarized according to their sampling\nschemes, learning procedures, variance reduction properties and how they\nexploit training data. Second, we review theoretical results that center around\nthe following key question: how many random features are needed to ensure a\nhigh approximation quality or no loss in the empirical/expected risks of the\nlearned estimator. Third, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of popular\nrandom features based algorithms on several large-scale benchmark datasets and\ndiscuss their approximation quality and prediction performance for\nclassification. Last, we discuss the relationship between random features and\nmodern over-parameterized deep neural networks (DNNs), including the use of\nhigh dimensional random features in the analysis of DNNs as well as the gaps\nbetween current theoretical and empirical results. This survey may serve as a\ngentle introduction to this topic, and as a users' guide for practitioners\ninterested in applying the representative algorithms and understanding\ntheoretical results under various technical assumptions. We hope that this\nsurvey will facilitate discussion on the open problems in this topic, and more\nimportantly, shed light on future research directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 13:44:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 20:32:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 19:26:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 11:13:28 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 11 Jul 2021 18:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

We define a\nsemi-definite programming problem (SDP) with these gains as decision variables\nand a discrete-time Lyapunov stability condition as a linear matrix inequality,\nconstraining the SDP optimization problem and guaranteeing the stability of the\nprioritized tasks. To the best of authors' knowledge, this work represents the\nfirst mathematical development of an SDP formulation that introduces stability\nconditions for a multi-objective closed-loop inverse kinematic problem for\nhighly redundant robots. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated\nthrough simulation case studies, including didactic examples and a Matlab\ntoolbox for the benefit of the community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 14:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-24"}

These\narchitectures consist of stages, which are sets of layers that operate on\nrepresentations in the same resolution. It has been demonstrated that\nincreasing the number of layers in each stage improves the prediction ability\nof the network. However, the resulting architecture becomes computationally\nexpensive in terms of floating point operations, memory requirements and\ninference time. Thus, significant human effort is necessary to evaluate\ndifferent trade-offs between depth and performance. To handle this problem,\nrecent works have proposed to automatically design high-performance\narchitectures, mainly by means of neural architecture search (NAS). Current NAS\nstrategies analyze a large set of possible candidate architectures and, hence,\nrequire vast computational resources and take many GPUs days. Motivated by\nthis, we propose a NAS approach to efficiently design accurate and low-cost\nconvolutional architectures and demonstrate that an efficient strategy for\ndesigning these architectures is to learn the depth stage-by-stage. For this\npurpose, our approach increases depth incrementally in each stage taking into\naccount its importance, such that stages with low importance are kept shallow\nwhile stages with high importance become deeper. We conduct experiments on the\nCIFAR and different versions of ImageNet datasets, where we show that\narchitectures discovered by our approach achieve better accuracy and efficiency\nthan human-designed architectures. Additionally, we show that architectures\ndiscovered on CIFAR-10 can be successfully transferred to large datasets.\nCompared to previous NAS approaches, our method is substantially more\nefficient, as it evaluates one order of magnitude fewer models and yields\narchitectures on par with the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 14:16:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 21:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

The main feature that distinguishes the\nlocalized from the itinerant electrons is the effect of the pressure on them.\nThe pressure strongly screens the itinerant electrons while the localized ones\nare almost unaffected. The screening of itinerant electrons leads to decreasing\nof their Coulomb repulsion, therefore to formation of doubly occupied and empty\nstates. These states are spin-singlet and the effective spin of itinerant\nelectrons, the zero-temperature magnetization in units of Bohr magneton,\ndecreases. We obtain an effective two-spin Heisenberg model, which explains the\nmagnetization-temperature diagram of $UGe_2$.

Below the Curie temperature $(T_x<T_C)$ the system\nundergoes a transition from high temperature phase, were only localized\nelectrons contribute the magnetization, to the low temperature one, where both\nitinerant and localized electrons contribute the magnetization. The\ncharacteristic temperature decreases when pressure increases. At the quantum\npartial order point $T_x=0$, the Zeeman splitting of the itinerant electrons is\nzero. This permits formation of Cooper pairs and an onset of superconductivity\ninduced by the transversal fluctuations of the localized electrons.

The single\nmost important parameter to measure in a factory is the operating hours of each\nmachine. Operating hours can be affected by machine maintenance as well as\nre-configuration for different products. For older machines without\nconnectivity, the operating state is typically indicated by signal lights of\ngreen, yellow and red colours. Accordingly, the goal is to develop a solution\nwhich can measure the operational state using the input from a video camera\ncapturing a factory floor. Using methods commonly employed for traffic light\nrecognition in autonomous cars, a system with an accuracy of over 99% in the\nspecified conditions is presented. It is believed that if more diverse video\ndata becomes available, a system with high reliability that generalizes well\ncould be developed using a similar methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 14:26:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 14:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-19"}

In order to model the dark matter halo inferred\nfrom the analysis of the measured velocities of Fornax's stars, we constructed\nseveral self-consistent quasi-equilibrium models based on two source code sets.\nOne of them (GalactICS Software, NEMO) deals with the self-consistent\ndistribution function modeling which depends on energy $E$ and vertical\ncomponent of the angular momentum $L_z$.

In spacetime games, the agents make decisions at various\npositions in Minkowski spacetime. Spacetime games can be seen as the least\ncommon denominator of strategic games on the one hand, and dynamic games with\nperfect information on the other hand. Indeed, strategic games correspond to a\nconfiguration with only spacelike-separated decisions (\"different rooms\").\nDynamic games with perfect information, on the other hand, correspond to\ntimelike-separated decisions (\"in turn\"). We show how to compute the strategic\nform and reduced strategic form of spacetime games. As a consequence, many\nexisting solution concepts, such as Nash equilibria, rationalizability,\nindividual rationality, etc, apply naturally to spacetime games. We introduce a\ncanonical injection of the class of spacetime games with perfect information\ninto the class of games in extensive form with imperfect information; we\nprovide a counterexample showing that this is a strict superset. This provides\na novel interpretation of a large number of games in extensive form with\nimperfect information in terms of the theory of special relativity, where\nnon-singleton information sets arise from the finite speed of light. This\nframework can be a useful tool for reasoning in quantum foundations, where it\nis important whether decisions such as the choice of a measurement axis or the\noutcome of a measurement are spacelike- or timelike- separated.

The measured absorbed flux is $\\approx 10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$\nin the 1.4-15 Angstrom range (0.77-8.86 keV). The line profiles are asymmetric,\nblue-shifted and skewed towards the blue side, as if the ejecta moving towards\nus are less absorbed than the receding ones. The full width at half maximum of\nmost emission lines is 1000-1200 km s$^{-1}$, with some extended blue wings.\nThe spectrum is thermal and consistent with a plasma in collisional ionization\nequilibrium with column density 1.3 $\\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and at least two\ncomponents at temperatures of about 1 keV and 4 keV, possibly a forward and a\nreverse shock, or regions with differently mixed ejecta and red giant wind. The\nspectrum is remarkably similar to the symbiotic RNe V745 Sco and RS Oph, but we\ncannot distinguish whether the shocks occurred at a distance of few AU from the\nred giant, or near the giant's photosphere, in a high density medium containing\nonly a small mass. The ratios of the flux in lines of aluminum, magnesium and\nneon relative to the flux in lines of silicon and iron probably indicate a\ncarbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 15:47:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 19:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

By tuning the Fermi energy from the\ncharge-neutrality point to a band edge, the currents partitioned into the three\noutgoing channels become nearly equal. Moreover, we find that current partition\nnode can be designed as a perfect valley filter and energy splitter controlled\nby electric gating. By changing the relative electric field magnitude, the\nintersection of three topological zero-lines can transform smoothly into a\nsingle zero line, and the current partition can be controlled precisely. We\nexplore the available methods for modulating this device systematically by\nchanging the Fermi energy, the energy gap size, and the size of central gapless\nregion. The current partition is also influenced by magnetic fields and the\nsystem size.

Hardware components on common wearable devices\ninclude an accelerometer and gyroscope, among other sensors. We demonstrate\nthat an accelerometer and gyroscope can pick up enough unique wrist movement\ninformation to identify digits being written by a user. With a data set of 400\nwriting samples, of either the digit zero or the digit one, we constructed a\nmachine learning model to correctly identify the digit being written based on\nthe movements of the wrist. Our model's performance on an unseen test set\nresulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve\nof 1.00. Loading our model onto our fabricated device resulted in 100% accuracy\nwhen predicting ten writing samples in real-time. The model's ability to\ncorrectly identify all digits via wrist movement and orientation changes raises\nsecurity concerns. Our results imply that nefarious individuals may be able to\ngain sensitive digit based information such as social security, credit card,\nand medical record numbers from wrist wearable devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 23:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-01"}

In this paper we will introduce a\nDescription<->Design framework to analyze past successes in computing,\nunderstand current problems and identify solutions moving forward. Engineering\nsystems with these emerging devices might require the modification of both the\ntype of descriptions of learning that we will design for, and the design\nmethodologies we employ in order to realize these new descriptions. We will\nexplore ideas from complexity engineering and analyze the advantages and\nchallenges they offer over traditional approaches to neuromorphic design with\nnovel computing fabrics. A reservoir computing example is used to understand\nthe specific changes that would accompany in moving towards a complexity\nengineering approach.

Then a sparse pilot pattern within multiple OFDM symbols\nis designed to obtain an ICI-free structure and transform the channel\nestimation problem into a joint-block-sparse model. Next, a novel block-based\nsimultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (BSOMP) algorithm is proposed to\njointly recover coefficient vectors accurately. Finally, to reduce the CE-BEM\nmodeling error, we carry out smoothing treatments of already estimated channel\ntaps via piecewise linear approximation.Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed channel estimation scheme can achieve higher estimation accuracy than\nconventional schemes, although with a smaller number of pilot subcarriers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 04:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

It is\nbased on the relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve technique, but\ninstead of sorting all observations in a categorical classification, the STONE\ntool uses the continuous nature of the observations. Rather than defining\nevents in the observations and then sliding the threshold only in the\nclassifier (model) data set, the threshold is changed simultaneously for both\nthe observational and model values, with the same threshold value for both data\nand model. This is only possible if the observations are continuous and the\nmodel output is in the same units and scale as the observations, that is, the\nmodel is trying to exactly reproduce the data. The STONE curve has several\nsimilarities with the ROC curve, plotting probability of detection against\nprobability of false detection, ranging from the (1,1) corner for low\nthresholds to the (0,0) corner for high thresholds, and values above the\nzero-intercept unity-slope line indicating better than random predictive\nability. The main difference is that the STONE curve can be nonmonotonic,\ndoubling back in both the x and y directions. These ripples reveal asymmetries\nin the data-model value pairs. This new technique is applied to modeling output\nof a common geomagnetic activity index as well as energetic electron fluxes in\nthe Earth's inner magnetosphere. It is not limited to space physics\napplications but can be used for any scientific or engineering field where\nnumerical models are used to reproduce observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 17:38:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-08"}
