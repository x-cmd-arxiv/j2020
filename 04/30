The literature\nincreasingly adopts model predictive control (MPC) to address this issue,\ntaking advantage of its capability of performing optimization under\nconstraints. However, the computationally complex online constrained\noptimization intrinsic to MPC often hinders real-time implementation. This\npaper is thus proposed to develop a framework for real-time charging control\nbased on explicit MPC (eMPC), exploiting its advantage in characterizing an\nexplicit solution to an MPC problem, to enable real-time charging control. The\nstudy begins with the formulation of MPC charging based on a nonlinear\nequivalent circuit model. Then, multi-segment linearization is conducted to the\noriginal model, and applying the eMPC design to the obtained linear models\nleads to a charging control algorithm. The proposed algorithm shifts the\nconstrained optimization to offline by precomputing explicit solutions to the\ncharging problem and expressing the charging law as piecewise affine functions.\nThis drastically reduces not only the online computational costs in the control\nrun but also the difficulty of coding. Extensive numerical simulation and\nexperimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed eMPC charging\ncontrol framework and algorithm. The research results can potentially meet the\nneeds for real-time battery management running on embedded hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 16:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-30"}

Google Scholar\nfound 88% of all citations, many of which were not found by the other sources,\nand nearly all citations found by the remaining sources (89%-94%). A similar\npattern held within most subject categories. Microsoft Academic is the second\nlargest overall (60% of all citations), including 82% of Scopus citations and\n86% of Web of Science citations. In most categories, Microsoft Academic found\nmore citations than Scopus and WoS (182 and 223 subject categories,\nrespectively), but had coverage gaps in some areas, such as Physics and some\nHumanities categories. After Scopus, Dimensions is fourth largest (54% of all\ncitations), including 84% of Scopus citations and 88% of WoS citations. It\nfound more citations than Scopus in 36 categories, more than WoS in 185, and\ndisplays some coverage gaps, especially in the Humanities. Following WoS, COCI\nis the smallest, with 28% of all citations. Google Scholar is still the most\ncomprehensive source. In many subject categories Microsoft Academic and\nDimensions are good alternatives to Scopus and WoS in terms of coverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 16:56:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 21:29:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2021 12:50:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

This type of analysis is often quite challenging,\nin part because existing results for fixed $n$ and $p$ are simply not sharp\nenough to yield good asymptotic results. One of the first convergence\ncomplexity results for an MCMC algorithm on a continuous state space is due to\nYang and Rosenthal (2019), who established a mixing time result for a Gibbs\nsampler (for a simple Bayesian random effects model) that was introduced and\nstudied by Rosenthal (1996). The asymptotic behavior of the spectral gap of\nthis Gibbs sampler is, however, still unknown. We use a recently developed\nsimulation technique (Qin et. al., 2019) to provide substantial numerical\nevidence that the gap is bounded away from 0 as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. We also\nestablish a pair of rigorous convergence complexity results for two different\nGibbs samplers associated with a generalization of the random effects model\nconsidered by Rosenthal (1996).

Denote the initial\n(non-random) size by $Z_0$ and the size of the $n$th change by $C_n$, $n= 1, 2,\n\\ldots$. Population sizes hence develop successively as $Z_1=Z_0+C_1,\\\nZ_2=Z_1+C_2$ and so on, indefinitely or until there are no further size\nchanges, due to extinction. Extinction is thus assumed final, so that $Z_n=0$\nimplies that $Z_{n+1}=0$, without there being any other finite absorbing class\nof population sizes. We make no assumptions about the time durations between\nthe successive changes. In the real world, or more specific models, those may\nbe of varying length, depending upon individual life span distributions and\ntheir interdependencies, the age-distribution at hand and intervening\ncircumstances. Changes may have quite varying distributions. The basic\nassumption is that there is a {\\em carrying capacity}, i.e. a non-negative\nnumber $K$ such that the conditional expectation of the change, given the\ncomplete past history, is non-positive whenever the population exceeds the\ncarrying capacity. Further, to avoid unnecessary technicalities, we assume that\nthe change $C_n$ equals -1 (one individual dying) with a conditional (given the\npast) probability uniformly bounded away from 0. It is a simple and not very\nrestrictive way to avoid parity phenomena, it is related to irreducibility in\nMarkov settings.

A set of operations over such graphs is fixed, and each of the operations\nhas a certain cost, a strictly positive number. The transformation problem\nconsists in the following: for given structures a and b and given costs, find a\nminimum total cost sequence of operations transforming a into b (\"the shortest\ntransformation of a into b\"). Each operation corresponds to an \"event\", the\nlatter being a change in the graph caused by executing one of the operations\nover it. The possibility of assigning different costs is important in\napplications, since it allows to distinguish between frequent and rare events.\nApparently, arbitrary costs make the problem NP-hard, which results in\nnontriviality of passing from one restriction on costs to another, if the\nproblem is solved by a linear or at least polynomial algorithm (assuming that P\nis not equal NP). We propose a novel linear time and space algorithm which\nconstructs a sequence of operations transforming a to b with total cost close\nor equal to the absolute minimum. Namely, if all the so-called DCJ operations\nhave the same cost w and if deletions and insertions have costs either both\nlarger or both less than w, then the algorithm outputs a transformation of a\ninto b with the total cost differing from the absolute minimum by at most 2w\n(in the former case) or equal to it (in the latter case).

Current\nestimates of GW detection rates for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and\nthe Pulsar Timing Array vary by three orders of magnitude. To understand this\nvariation, we simulate the merger of equal-mass, eccentric, galaxy pairs with\ncentral massive black holes and shallow inner density cusps. We model the\nformation and hardening of a central BHB using the Fast Multiple Method as a\nforce solver, which features a $O(N)$ scaling with the number $N$ of particles\nand obtains results equivalent to direct-summation simulations. At $N \\sim\n5\\times 10^5$, typical for contemporary studies, the eccentricity of the BHBs\ncan vary significantly for different random realisations of the same initial\ncondition, resulting in a substantial variation of the merger timescale. This\nscatter owes to the stochasticity of stellar encounters with the BHB and\ndecreases with increasing $N$. We estimate that $N \\sim 10^7$ within the\nstellar half-light radius suffices to reduce the scatter in the merger\ntimescale to $\\sim 10$\\%.

Some of the supergiant stars may transit the HRD from blue to red\nand then again to blue during their late evolutionary stages, as exemplified by\nthe progenitor of SN 1987A. Others may transit a given part of the HRD more\nthan twice in a \"blue loop\" and end up as red supergiants before they explode.\nSince stars in blue loops spend a considerable part of their lives there, these\nstages may change the relative number of modeled supergiants in the HRD. Their\nlifetimes in turn depend upon the initial mass of the star, how convection in\nits interior is modeled, and how much mass loss takes place during its\nevolution. The observed ratio of the number of blue to red supergiants and\nyellow to red supergiants sensitively test the stellar evolution theory. We\ncompare modeled number ratios of these supergiants with observed data from the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud as it has a metallicity very similar to that of the\nenvironment of SN 2013ej.

The radius differs\ndramatically with overshoot.

To achieve this objective, a\nreliable and updated description of the local status of crops is required.\nRemote sensing, and in particular satellite-based imagery, proved to be a\nvaluable tool in crop mapping, monitoring, and diseases assessment. However,\nfreely available satellite imagery with low or moderate resolutions showed some\nlimits in specific agricultural applications, e.g., where crops are grown by\nrows. Indeed, in this framework, the satellite's output could be biased by\nintra-row covering, giving inaccurate information about crop status.

By analyzing both periodic and non-periodic ensembles, we show\nthat the RTE emitted by a single 2D nanoparticle ensemble is sensitive to the\nparticle distribution.

To fill this gap, we formally define the\ntime-dependent capacitated arc routing problem (TDCARP), with travel and\nservice speed functions given directly at the network level. Under these\nassumptions, the quickest path between locations can change over time, leading\nto a complex problem that challenges the capabilities of current solution\nmethods.

To study this, we choose economic production\nnetworks as a paradigm. An economic network can be examined at many levels:\nlinkages among individual agents (microscopic), among firms/sectors\n(mesoscopic) or among countries (macroscopic). New emergent dynamical\nproperties appear at every level, so the granularity matters. For viral\nepidemics, even an individual node may act as an epicenter of distress and\npotentially affect the entire network. Economic networks, however, are known to\nbe immune at the micro-levels and more prone to failure in the\nmeso/macro-levels.

Many methods for\nestimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) have been proposed in\nrecent years, but there are important theoretical gaps in understanding if and\nwhen such methods are optimal. This is especially true when the CATE has\nnontrivial structure (e.g., smoothness or sparsity). Our work contributes in\nseveral main ways. First, we study a two-stage doubly robust CATE estimator and\ngive a generic model-free error bound, which, despite its generality, yields\nsharper results than those in the current literature. We apply the bound to\nderive error rates in nonparametric models with smoothness or sparsity, and\ngive sufficient conditions for oracle efficiency. Underlying our error bound is\na general oracle inequality for regression with estimated or imputed outcomes,\nwhich is of independent interest; this is the second main contribution. The\nthird contribution is aimed at understanding the fundamental statistical limits\nof CATE estimation. To that end, we propose and study a local polynomial\nadaptation of double-residual regression. We show that this estimator can be\noracle efficient under even weaker conditions, if used with a specialized form\nof sample splitting and careful choices of tuning parameters.

In this Topical\nReview, we highlight underlying properties of this class of materials and\npresent two representative antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, namely,\n4d-electron based Ca2RuO4 and 5d-electron based Sr2IrO4, as model systems. In\nessence, a small, applied electrical current engages with the lattice,\ncritically reducing structural distortions, which in turn readily suppresses\nthe antiferromagnetic and insulating state and subsequently results in emergent\nnew states.

The semi-infinite one-dimensional\nmodel is often adopted, and several well-developed techniques for application\nof this model to surface temperature data are available. However, when a\nspatial variation of heat flux exists across the surface, the application of\nthe semi-infinite one-dimensional approach may not always be a reasonable\napproximation. In this paper we introduce a method for treatment of the\nmeasured surface temperature history that is more accurate than the\nsemi-infinite one-dimensional approximation when substrate lateral conduction\nis significant and the relative spatial distribution of the flux is known a\npriori. This new method uses the so-called \\textit{Neumann heat kernel}, which\nevolves a temperature over an insulated domain with unit energy initially\ndeposited at a specified point. A useful impulse response function is formed by\nintegrating this Neumann heat kernel against the spatial variation of flux over\nthe surface of the domain. Neumann heat kernels are constructed for the solid\nbox, cylinder, and sphere. By applying the heat kernel result for the sphere to\nthe analysis of a convective experiment using hemispherical-nosed probes, we\ndemonstrate how the theoretical results enhance the practical analysis of\ntransient surface temperature measurements.

Numerous subtleties complicate the\ngeneralization of discrete liveness verification techniques, such as loop\nvariants, to the continuous setting.

Several\nworks of channel pruning have been proposed to prune away compute and memory\nfrom models that were trained already. Typically, these involve policies that\ndecide which and how many channels to remove from each layer leading to\nchannel-wise and/or layer-wise pruning profiles, respectively. In this paper,\nwe conduct several baseline experiments and establish that profiles from random\nchannel-wise pruning policies are as good as metric-based ones. We also\nestablish that there may exist profiles from some layer-wise pruning policies\nthat are measurably better than common baselines. We then demonstrate that the\ntop layer-wise pruning profiles found using an exhaustive random search from\none datatset are also among the top profiles for other datasets. This implies\nthat we could identify out-of-the-box layer-wise pruning profiles using\nbenchmark datasets and use these directly for new datasets. Furthermore, we\ndevelop a Reinforcement Learning (RL) policy-based search algorithm with a\ndirect objective of finding transferable layer-wise pruning profiles using many\nmodels for the same architecture. We use a novel reward formulation that drives\nthis RL search towards an expected compression while maximizing accuracy. Our\nresults show that our transferred RL-based profiles are as good or better than\nbest profiles found on the original dataset via exhaustive search.

To pinpoint the\nkinds of abstract structure that models may be encoding to lead to this\nimprovement, we run similar experiments with two artificial parentheses\nlanguages: one which has a hierarchical recursive structure, and a control\nwhich has paired tokens but no recursion. Surprisingly, training a model on\neither of these artificial languages leads to the same substantial gains when\ntesting on natural language. Further experiments on transfer between natural\nlanguages controlling for vocabulary overlap show that zero-shot performance on\na test language is highly correlated with typological syntactic similarity to\nthe training language, suggesting that representations induced by pre-training\ncorrespond to the cross-linguistic syntactic properties.

We\nhave compared the data from nine archives: Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO),\nKislovodsk, Pulkovo, Debrecen, Kodaikanal, Solar Optical Observing Network\n(SOON), Rome, Catania, and Yunnan Observatories, covering the period between\n1874 and 2019. Mutual comparisons of the individual records have been employed\nto produce homogeneous and inter-calibrated records of daily projected and\ncorrected areas. As in earlier studies, the basis of the composite is formed by\nthe data from RGO. After 1976, the only datasets used are those from\nKislovodsk, Pulkovo and Debrecen observatories. This choice was made based on\nthe temporal coverage and the quality of the data. In contrast to the SOON data\nused in previous area composites for the post-RGO period, the properties of the\ndata from Kislovodsk and Pulkovo are very similar to those from the RGO series.\nThey also directly overlap the RGO data in time, which makes their\ncross-calibration with RGO much more reliable. We have also computed and\nprovide the daily Photometric Sunspot Index (PSI) widely used, e.g., in\nempirical reconstructions of solar irradiance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 07:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

The 4th annual edition of the AI\nCity Challenge has attracted 315 participating teams across 37 countries, who\nleveraged city-scale real traffic data and high-quality synthetic data to\ncompete in four challenge tracks.

Track 2 addressed city-scale\nvehicle re-identification with augmented synthetic data to substantially\nincrease the training set for the task. Track 3 addressed city-scale\nmulti-target multi-camera vehicle tracking. Track 4 addressed traffic anomaly\ndetection. The evaluation system shows two leader boards, in which a general\nleader board shows all submitted results, and a public leader board shows\nresults limited to our contest participation rules, that teams are not allowed\nto use external data in their work.

Until now most of the clusters in the conventional models have been\nlimited to the closures of the three-dimensional harmonic oscillators, such as\n$^4$He, $^{16}$O, and $^{40}$Ca. In the neutron-rich nuclei, however, the\nneutron to proton ratio is not unity, and it is worthwhile to think about more\nneutron-rich objects with $N>Z$ as the building blocks of cluster structures.\nHere the nuclei with the neutron number six, which is the subclosure of the\n$p_{3/2}$ subshell of the $jj$-coupling shell model, are assumed to be\nclusters, and thus we study the $^8$He and $^9$Li cluster structures in\n$^{16}$Be ($^8$He+$^8$He), $^{17}$B ($^8$He+$^9$Li), $^{18}$C ($^9$Li+$^9$Li),\nand $^{24}$C ($^8$He+$^8$He+$^8$He). Recent progress of the antisymmetrized\nquasi cluster model (AQCM) enables us to utilize $jj$-coupling shell model wave\nfunctions as the clusters rather easily.

To predict the cluster states with large\nrelative distances, we increase the expectation value of the principal quantum\nnumbers by adding the nodes to the lowest states under the condition that the\ntotal angular momentum is unchanged (equal to $J^\\pi =0$). As a result,\ndeveloped cluster states are obtained around the corresponding threshold\nenergies. The rotational band structure of $^{24}$C, which reflect the symmetry\nof equilateral triangular configuration ($D_{3h}$ symmetry) of three $^8$He\nclusters, also appears around the threshold energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 09:09:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

The unprecedented possibility to acquire high\nresolution Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) data (series of images with high\nrevisit time period on the same geographical area) is opening new opportunities\nto monitor the different aspects of the Earth Surface but, at the same time, it\nis raising up new challenges in term of suitable methods to analyze and exploit\nsuch huge amount of rich and complex image data. One of the main task\nassociated to SITS data analysis is related to land cover mapping where\nsatellite data are exploited via learning methods to recover the Earth Surface\nstatus aka the corresponding land cover classes. Due to operational\nconstraints, the collected label information, on which machine learning\nstrategies are trained, is often limited in volume and obtained at coarse\ngranularity carrying out inexact and weak knowledge that can affect the whole\nprocess.

In this study,\nusing an idealized general circulation model, we examine the climate response\nto changes in eccentricity for both zero and non-zero obliquity planets. In the\nzero obliquity case, a comparison between the seasonal response to changes in\neccentricity and perpetual changes in the solar constant shows that the\nseasonal response strongly depends on the orbital period and radiative\ntimescale. More specifically, using a simple energy balance model, we show the\nimportance of the latitudinal structure of the radiative timescale in the\nclimate response. We also show that the response strongly depends on the\natmospheric moisture content. The combination of an eccentric orbit with\nnon-zero obliquity is complex, as the insolation also depends on the perihelion\nposition. Although the detailed response of the climate to variations in\neccentricity, obliquity, and perihelion is involved, the circulation is\nconstrained mainly by the thermal Rossby number and the maximum temperature\nlatitude.

The dynamics and the\ntime evolution of the system are investigated in detail revealing the winning\nmechanism and process of the natural selection in such dispersal-structured\npopulations.

Model counting is a\nfundamental but hard problem in computer science with varied applications.\nRecent years have witnessed a surge of effort towards developing efficient\nalgorithmic techniques that combine the classical 2-universal hashing with the\nremarkable progress in SAT solving over the past decade. These techniques\naugment the CNF formula F with random XOR constraints and invoke an NP oracle\nrepeatedly on the resultant CNF-XOR formulas. In practice, calls to the NP\noracle calls are replaced a SAT solver whose runtime performance is adversely\naffected by size of XOR constraints. The standard construction of 2-universal\nhash functions chooses every variable with probability p = 1/2 leading to XOR\nconstraints of size n/2 in expectation. Consequently, the challenge is to\ndesign sparse hash functions where variables can be chosen with smaller\nprobability and lead to smaller sized XOR constraints.\n  In this paper, we address this challenge from theoretical and practical\nperspectives. First, we formalize a relaxation of universal hashing, called\nconcentrated hashing and establish a novel and beautiful connection between\nconcentration measures of these hash functions and isoperimetric inequalities\non boolean hypercubes. This allows us to obtain (log m) tight bounds on\nvariance and dispersion index and show that p = O( log(m)/m ) suffices for\ndesign of sparse hash functions from {0, 1}^n to {0, 1}^m. We then use sparse\nhash functions belonging to this concentrated hash family to develop new\napproximate counting algorithms. A comprehensive experimental evaluation of our\nalgorithm on 1893 benchmarks demonstrates that usage of sparse hash functions\ncan lead to significant speedups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 11:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-01"}

In the existing publications\nand in various communication standards, initially square quadrature amplitude\nmodulation (SQAM) constellations (even power of 2) were considered. However,\nonly the square constellations are not efficient for varying channel conditions\nand rate requirements, and hence, odd power of 2 constellations were\nintroduced. For odd power of 2 constellations, rectangular QAM (RQAM) is\ncommonly used. However, RQAM is not a good choice due to its lower power\nefficiency, and a modified cross QAM (XQAM) constellation is preferred as it\nprovides improved power efficiency over RQAM due to its energy efficient two\ndimensional (2D) structure. The increasing demand for high data-rates has\nfurther encouraged the research towards more compact 2D constellations which\nlead to hexagonal lattice structure based constellations, referred to as\nhexagonal QAM (HQAM). In this work, various QAM constellations are discussed\nand detailed study of star QAM, XQAM, and HQAM constellations is presented.\nGeneration, peak and average energies, peak-to-average-power ratio,\nsymbol-error-rate, decision boundaries, bit mapping, Gray code penalty, and\nbit-error-rate of star QAM, XQAM, and HQAM constellations with different\nconstellation orders are presented. Finally, a comparative study of various QAM\nconstellations is presented which justifies the supremacy of HQAM over other\nQAM constellations. With this, it can be claimed that the use of the HQAM in\nvarious wireless communication systems and standards can further improve the\nperformance targeted for beyond 5G wireless communication systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 11:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-01"}

First, when inferring a user click, the impact of the\ncontextual information, such as documents that have been examined, is often\nignored.

Specifically, we adopt a\nrecurrent neural network to model the contextual information and estimates the\nconditional likelihood of user feedback at each position. We then incorporate\nsurvival analysis techniques with the probability chain rule to mathematically\nrecover the unbiased joint probability of one user's various behaviors.

The distinctive Fermi surfaces of such semimetals, dubbed as type III or\nzero-index WSMs, gives rise to unique physical properties: one of the edge\nmodes of the semimetal exhibits a zero index of refraction along a specific\ndirection, in stark contrast to types I and II WSMs for which the index of\nrefraction is always non-zero. We show that the zero-index response of such\ntopological phases enables exciting applications such as extraordinary wave\ntransmission (EOT).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 13:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 09:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

Due to this fact, vehicular\ntechnologies have been evolving with the intent of reducing these fatalities.\nThis evolution has not finished yet since, for instance, the predictions of\npedestrian paths could improve the current Automatic Emergency Braking Systems\n(AEBS). For this reason, this paper proposes a method to predict future\npedestrian paths, poses and intentions up to 1s in advance. This method is\nbased on Balanced Gaussian Process Dynamical Models (B-GPDMs), which reduce the\n3D time-related information extracted from keypoints or joints placed along\npedestrian bodies into low-dimensional spaces. The B-GPDM is also capable of\ninferring future latent positions and reconstruct their associated\nobservations. However, learning a generic model for all kind of pedestrian\nactivities normally provides less ccurate predictions. For this reason, the\nproposed method obtains multiple models of four types of activity, i.e.\nwalking, stopping, starting and standing, and selects the most similar model to\nestimate future pedestrian states. This method detects starting activities\n125ms after the gait initiation with an accuracy of 80% and recognises stopping\nintentions 58.33ms before the event with an accuracy of 70%. Concerning the\npath prediction, the mean error for stopping activities at a Time-To-Event\n(TTE) of 1s is 238.01mm and, for starting actions, the mean error at a TTE of\n0s is 331.93mm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 13:08:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-01"}

We study this class of 3D\nmodels by collecting a significant number of representatives and quantitatively\nevaluating their quality according to several metrics.

In our Levenstein VAE, we propose\nto replace the evidence lower bound (ELBO) with a new objective which is simple\nto optimize and prevents posterior collapse.

Prevalent graph embedding\napproaches, e.g., TransE, learn structured knowledge via representing graph\nelements into dense embeddings and capturing their triple-level relationship\nwith spatial distance. However, they are hardly generalizable to the elements\nnever visited in training and are intrinsically vulnerable to graph\nincompleteness. In contrast, textual encoding approaches, e.g., KG-BERT, resort\nto graph triple's text and triple-level contextualized representations. They\nare generalizable enough and robust to the incompleteness, especially when\ncoupled with pre-trained encoders. But two major drawbacks limit the\nperformance: (1) high overheads due to the costly scoring of all possible\ntriples in inference, and (2) a lack of structured knowledge in the textual\nencoder. In this paper, we follow the textual encoding paradigm and aim to\nalleviate its drawbacks by augmenting it with graph embedding techniques -- a\ncomplementary hybrid of both paradigms. Specifically, we partition each triple\ninto two asymmetric parts as in translation-based graph embedding approach, and\nencode both parts into contextualized representations by a Siamese-style\ntextual encoder. Built upon the representations, our model employs both\ndeterministic classifier and spatial measurement for representation and\nstructure learning respectively.

This is the well-known SIR model in which we\nfurther divide both S and I into high and low risk categories.

This is typically achieved by\nexploiting a semantic feature space shared by both seen and unseen classes,\ni.e., attribute or word vector, as the bridge. One common practice in zero-shot\nlearning is to train a projection between the visual and semantic feature\nspaces with labeled seen classes examples. When inferring, this learned\nprojection is applied to unseen classes and recognizes the class labels by some\nmetrics. However, the visual and semantic feature spaces are mutually\nindependent and have quite different manifold structures. Under such a\nparadigm, most existing methods easily suffer from the domain shift problem and\nweaken the performance of zero-shot recognition. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel model called AMS-SFE. It considers the alignment of manifold\nstructures by semantic feature expansion. Specifically, we build upon an\nautoencoder-based model to expand the semantic features from the visual inputs.\nAdditionally, the expansion is jointly guided by an embedded manifold extracted\nfrom the visual feature space of the data. Our model is the first attempt to\nalign both feature spaces by expanding semantic features and derives two\nbenefits: first, we expand some auxiliary features that enhance the semantic\nfeature space; second and more importantly, we implicitly align the manifold\nstructures between the visual and semantic feature spaces; thus, the projection\ncan be better trained and mitigate the domain shift problem. Extensive\nexperiments show significant performance improvement, which verifies the\neffectiveness of our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 14:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-01"}

The problem is formulated in an optimal\ncontrol framework, where the drivers (controls) aim to guide the evaders\n(states) to a desired region of the Euclidean space. The numerical simulation\nof such models quickly becomes unfeasible for a large number of interacting\nagents. To reduce the computational cost, we use the Random Batch Method (RBM),\nwhich provides a computationally feasible approximation of the dynamics. At\neach time step, the RBM randomly divides the set of particles into small\nsubsets (batches), considering only the interactions inside each batch. Due to\nthe averaging effect, the RBM approximation converges to the exact dynamics as\nthe time discretization gets finer. We propose an algorithm that leads to the\noptimal control of a fixed RBM approximated trajectory using a classical\ngradient descent. The resulting control is not optimal for the original\ncomplete system, but rather for the reduced RBM model. We then adopt a Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) strategy to handle the error in the dynamics. While\nthe system evolves in time, the MPC strategy consists in periodically updating\nthe state and computing the optimal control over a long-time horizon, which is\nimplemented recursively in a shorter time-horizon. This leads to a\nsemi-feedback control strategy. Through numerical experiments we show that the\ncombination of RBM and MPC leads to a significant reduction of the\ncomputational cost, preserving the capacity of controlling the overall\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 14:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-01"}

Phenomenological\nmodels suggest a femtosecond scale exchange relaxation between sublattice\nmagnetization as the driving mechanism for switching. The recent observation of\nthermally induced switching in GdFeCo by using both several picosecond optical\nlaser pulse as well as electric current pulses has questioned this previous\nunderstanding. This has raised the question of whether or not the same\nswitching mechanics are acting at the femo- and picosecond scales. In this\nwork, we aim at filling this gap in the understanding of the switching\nmechanisms behind thermal single-pulse switching. To that end, we have studied\nexperimentally thermal single-pulse switching in GdFeCo alloys, for a wide\nrange of system parameters, such as composition, laser power and pulse\nduration. We provide a quantitative description of the switching dynamics using\natomistic spin dynamics methods with excellent agreement between the model and\nour experiments across a wide range of parameters and timescales, ranging from\nfemtoseconds to picoseconds. Furthermore, we find distinct element-specific\ndamping parameters as a key ingredient for switching with long picosecond\npulses and argue, that switching with pulse durations as long as 15 picoseconds\nis possible due to a low damping constant of Gd. Our findings can be easily\nextended to speed up dynamics in other contexts where ferrimagnetic GdFeCo\nalloys have been already demonstrated to show fast and energy-efficient\nprocesses, e.g. domain-wall motion in a track and spin-orbit torque switching\nin spintronics devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 14:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

We\ncomputed the evolution from the protostar to the MS phase of accreting models\nwith final masses of 0.7 and 0.8 M$_\\odot$, and three metallicities Z=0.0001,\nZ=0.0010, and Z=0.0050.

Also,\ncold accretion models with a relatively large $M_{seed}$ ($\\gtrsim 10~M_{jup}$)\nor $R_{seed}$ ($\\gtrsim 1~R_\\odot$) converge to standard non-accreting ones in\nless than about 10-20~Myr.

The\nubiquitous Kuramoto models rely on an {\\em a priori} fixed connectivity pattern\nfacilitates mutual communication and influence between oscillators. In\nbiological synchronizable systems, like the mammalian suprachaismatic nucleus,\nenabling communication comes at a cost -- the organism expends energy creating\nand maintaining the system -- linking their development to evolutionary\nselection. Here, we introduce and analyze a new evolutionary game theoretic\nframework modeling the behavior and evolution of systems of coupled\noscillators. Each oscillator in our model is characterized by a pair of dynamic\nbehavioral traits: an oscillatory phase and whether they connect and\ncommunicate to other oscillators or not. Evolution of the system occurs along\nthese dimensions, allowing oscillators to change their phases and/or their\ncommunication strategies. We measure success of mutations by comparing the\nbenefit of phase synchronization to the organism balanced against the cost of\ncreating and maintaining connections between the oscillators. Despite such a\nsimple setup, this system exhibits a wealth of nontrivial behaviors, mimicking\ndifferent classical games -- the Prisoner's Dilemma, the snowdrift game, and\ncoordination games -- as the landscape of the oscillators changes over time.\nDespite such complexity, we find a surprisingly simple characterization of\nsynchronization through connectivity and communication: if the benefit of\nsynchronization $B(0)$ is greater than twice the cost $c$, $B(0) > 2c$, the\norganism will evolve towards complete communication and phase synchronization.\nTaken together, our model demonstrates possible evolutionary constraints on\nboth the existence of a synchronized oscillatory system and its overall\nconnectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 15:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-01"}

This issue becomes\ncritical in the case of aeroacoustic simulations, where accurate pressure\nestimations are of paramount importance.

The analysis aims\nto obtain a possibly complete picture of the relationship between the transit\ntime of propagation of CMEs and interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs)\nfrom the Sun to the Earth (more precisely, the time interval dtp from the\nmoment of an eruption until the peak of the corresponding GMS) and the maximum\nintensity of this GMS, as measured by the disturbance storm time geomagnetic\nindex Dst. Two groups of events are singled out: one includes GMSs, the source\nof which was an eruption from an active region (AR events), the other GMSs\ncaused by filament eruptions from quiescent areas of the Sun located outside\nARs (QS events). The distribution of the large number of the analyzed events on\na dtp - Dst plane confirms and substantially clarifies the known regularities.\nThe AR events are characterized by a shorter transit time (dtp ~ 1-4 days) and\nmuch stronger GMSs (Dst up to -600 nT mainly) in comparison with the QS events\n(dtp ~ 3-5 days, Dst > -200 nT). For events of both groups, the shorter transit\ntime of CMEs/ICMEs, the more intense GMSs; in particular, for AR events when\ndtp declines from 4 to 1 day, Dst decreases on average from -100 to -470 nT and\ncan reach -900 nT. From the point of view of the nature of GMSs and their\nsources on the Sun, the obtained results mean that both the speed of CMEs/ICMEs\nand the strength of the magnetic field transferred by them are largely\ndetermined by the parameters of the corresponding eruptions, in particular, by\nthe eruptive magnetic flux and the released energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 15:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

While there is ample experimental evidence for this\nphenomenon, its theoretical characterization directly from nucleons as degrees\nof freedom remains a challenge, making it difficult to improve nuclear forces\nusing clustering observables.

To solve this issue, AI-based technologies, such\nas deep learning, have been used recently as effective computer-aided means to\nimprove diagnostic efficiency.

To\naddress them, we propose a new deep domain adaptation method for COVID-19\ndiagnosis, namely COVID-DA.

However, recent studies in network\nscience pinpoint towards the importance of temporal characteristics in the\ndiffusion of opinion. As such, we combine concepts of micro-scale opinion\ndynamics and temporal epidemics, and develop a novel macro-scale temporal\nattenuation (TA) model, which uses pre-election poll data to improve\nforecasting accuracy. Our hypothesis is that the timing of publicizing opinion\npolls plays a significant role in how opinion oscillates, especially right\nbefore elections. Thus, we define the momentum of opinion as a temporal\nfunction which bounces up when opinion is injected in a multi-opinion system of\nvoters, and dampens during states of relaxation. We validate TA on survey data\nfrom the US Presidential Elections between 1968-2016, and TA outperforms\nstatistical methods, as well the best pollsters at their time, in 10 out of 13\npresidential elections. We present two different implementations of the TA\nmodel, which accumulate an average forecasting error of 2.8-3.28 points over\nthe 48-year period. Conversely, statistical methods accumulate 7.48 points\nerror, and the best pollsters accumulate 3.64 points. Overall, TA offers\nincreases of 23-37% in forecasting performance compared to the state of the\nart. We show that the effectiveness of TA does not drop when relatively few\npolls are available; moreover, with increasing availability of pre-election\nsurveys, we believe that our TA model will become a reference alongside other\nmodern election forecasting techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 09:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-07"}

Mobile IoT is\ncomposed by mobile IoT devices such as vehicles, wearable devices and\nsmartphones. Owing to the time-varying channel conditions, traffic loads and\ncomputing loads, it is challenging to improve the quality of service (QoS) of\nmobile IoT devices. As task delay consists of both the transmission delay and\ncomputing delay, we investigate the resource allocation (i.e., including both\nradio resource and computation resource) in both the wireless channel and fog\nnode to minimize the delay of all tasks while their QoS constraints are\nsatisfied. We formulate the resource allocation problem into an integer\nnon-linear problem, where both the radio resource and computation resource are\ntaken into account.

It\nremains challenging to develop NLP attacks and utilize them to improve model\nperformance. This paper introduces TextAttack, a Python framework for\nadversarial attacks, data augmentation, and adversarial training in NLP.\nTextAttack builds attacks from four components: a goal function, a set of\nconstraints, a transformation, and a search method. TextAttack's modular design\nenables researchers to easily construct attacks from combinations of novel and\nexisting components. TextAttack provides implementations of 16 adversarial\nattacks from the literature and supports a variety of models and datasets,\nincluding BERT and other transformers, and all GLUE tasks. TextAttack also\nincludes data augmentation and adversarial training modules for using\ncomponents of adversarial attacks to improve model accuracy and robustness.\nTextAttack is democratizing NLP: anyone can try data augmentation and\nadversarial training on any model or dataset, with just a few lines of code.\nCode and tutorials are available at https://github.com/QData/TextAttack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 21:33:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 17:37:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 19:33:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 00:10:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

For these calibrations to be feasible, suitable\nultra low-noise accelerometers and/or signal processing functions are needed.\nHere we present two digital signal processing (DSP) functions designed to\nmeasure ultra low-noise acceleration in calibration systems.

The\ncontrol group used the most common type of Quadrone, and determine if the\nhypothesis is correct by testing various structures and materials under the\nsame conditions, and measuring noise. UAVs using Coanda Effect are not of any\nshape or structure that is not changeable, and internal space is also empty.\nThat's why the Coanda Effect UAV we present can be improved through follow-up\nresearch.
