In this paper, we focus\non the task of cross-modal retrieval between food images and cooking recipes.\nWe present Modality-Consistent Embedding Network (MCEN) that learns\nmodality-invariant representations by projecting images and texts to the same\nembedding space. To capture the latent alignments between modalities, we\nincorporate stochastic latent variables to explicitly exploit the interactions\nbetween textual and visual features. Importantly, our method learns the\ncross-modal alignments during training but computes embeddings of different\nmodalities independently at inference time for the sake of efficiency.\nExtensive experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed MCEN\noutperforms all existing approaches on the benchmark Recipe1M dataset and\nrequires less computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 16:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-03"}

In\nparticular, self-reported outcomes are typical in cohort studies for chronic\ndiseases such as diabetes in order to avoid the burden of expensive diagnostic\ntests. Dietary intake, which is also commonly collected by self-report and\nsubject to measurement error, is a major factor linked to diabetes and other\nchronic diseases. These errors can bias exposure-disease associations that\nultimately can mislead clinical decision-making. We have extended an existing\nsemiparametric likelihood-based method for handling error-prone, discrete\nfailure time outcomes to also address covariate error. We conduct an extensive\nnumerical study to compare the proposed method to the naive approach that\nignores measurement error in terms of bias and efficiency in the estimation of\nthe regression parameter of interest. In all settings considered, the proposed\nmethod showed minimal bias and maintained coverage probability, thus\noutperforming the naive analysis which showed extreme bias and low coverage.\nThis method is applied to data from the Women's Health Initiative to assess the\nassociation between energy and protein intake and the risk of incident diabetes\nmellitus. Our results show that correcting for errors in both the self-reported\noutcome and dietary exposures leads to considerably different hazard ratio\nestimates than those from analyses that ignore measurement error, which\ndemonstrates the importance of correcting for both outcome and covariate error.\nComputational details and R code for implementing the proposed method are\npresented in Section S1 of the Supplementary Materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 16:24:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 14:32:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 15:54:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 21:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}

Their analytic\ncenters, i.e. the maximum determinant elements of the feasible set spanned by\nthese LMIs, are the solution of many well-known problems in statistics,\ncommunications, geometry, and control and can be approximated to arbitrary\nprecision by semidefinite programs (SDPs). The quality of these approximations\nis measured with respect to the difference in log-determinant of both the exact\nand the approximate solution to these SDPs, a quantity that follows directly\nfrom the duality theory of semidefinite programming. However, in many\napplications the relevant parameters are functions of the entries of the LMI\nargument $X$. In these cases it is of interest to develop metrics that quantify\nthe quality of approximate solutions based on the error on these parameters,\nsomething that the log-determinant error fails to capture due to the non-linear\ninteraction of all the matrix entries. In this work we develop upper bounds on\nthe Frobenius norm error between suboptimal solutions $X_f$ and the exact\noptimizer $X_*$ of maximum determinant problems, a metric that provides a\ndirect translation to the entry-wise error of $X$ and thus to the relevant\nparameters of the application. We show that these bounds can be expressed\nthrough the use of the Lambert function $W(x)$, i.e. the solution of the\nequation $W(x) e^{W(x)}= x$, and derive novel bounds for one of its branches to\ngenerate efficient closed-form bounds on the Euclidean distance to the LMI\nanalytic center.

Despite considerable research into the underlying mechanisms\nbehind this phenomenon, several open questions still remain. Motivated by this,\nwe put forth a detailed study of DPTs from the perspective of quantum phase\nspace and entropy production, a key concept in thermodynamics. We focus on the\nLipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and use spin coherent states to construct the\ncorresponding Husimi-$Q$ quasi-probability distribution. The entropy of the\n$Q$-function, known as Wehrl entropy, provides a measure of the coarse-grained\ndynamics of the system and, therefore, evolves non-trivially even for closed\nsystems. We show that critical quenches lead to a quasi-monotonic growth of the\nWehrl entropy in time, combined with small oscillations. The former reflects\nthe information scrambling characteristic of these transitions and serves as a\nmeasure of entropy production. On the other hand, the small oscillations imply\nnegative entropy production rates and, therefore, signal the recurrences of the\nLoschmidt echo. Finally, we also study a Gaussification of the model based on a\nmodified Holstein-Primakoff approximation. This allows us to identify the\nrelative contribution of the low energy sector to the emergence of DPTs.

Different to \"open-set\" and \"universal domain\nadaptation\", which both regard all objects from new classes as \"unknown\", we\naim at explicit test-time prediction for these new classes. To reach this goal,\nwe propose a framework that leverages domain adaptation and zero-shot learning\ntechniques to enable \"boundless\" adaptation in the target domain.

When it comes to real-world scenarios such as\nrecommendation system and online advertising, however, it is essential to\nconsider the resource consumption of exploration. In practice, there is\ntypically non-zero cost associated with executing a recommendation (arm) in the\nenvironment, and hence, the policy should be learned with a fixed exploration\ncost constraint. It is challenging to learn a global optimal policy directly,\nsince it is a NP-hard problem and significantly complicates the exploration and\nexploitation trade-off of bandit algorithms. Existing approaches focus on\nsolving the problems by adopting the greedy policy which estimates the expected\nrewards and costs and uses a greedy selection based on each arm's expected\nreward/cost ratio using historical observation until the exploration resource\nis exhausted. However, existing methods are hard to extend to infinite time\nhorizon, since the learning process will be terminated when there is no more\nresource. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical adaptive contextual bandit\nmethod (HATCH) to conduct the policy learning of contextual bandits with a\nbudget constraint. HATCH adopts an adaptive method to allocate the exploration\nresource based on the remaining resource/time and the estimation of reward\ndistribution among different user contexts. In addition, we utilize full of\ncontextual feature information to find the best personalized recommendation.\nFinally, in order to prove the theoretical guarantee, we present a regret bound\nanalysis and prove that HATCH achieves a regret bound as low as $O(\\sqrt{T})$.\nThe experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the\nproposed method on both synthetic data sets and the real-world applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 17:04:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 16:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

The\nconversion from NH2 radicals to NH2CHO is 2-16 times higher than the conversion\nfrom CH3 radicals to CH3CHO under the explored experimental conditions, likely\nbecause the formation of the latter competes with the formation of larger\nhydrocarbons. In addition, the conversion of NH2 into NH2CHO at 10 K increases\nwith the NH3 abundance in the ice, and also with the temperature in\nCO-dominated CO:NH3 ices. This is consistent with the presence of a small NH2\nand HCO reorientation barrier for the formation of NH2CHO, which is overcome\nwith an increase in the ice temperature. The measured NH2CHO and CH3CHO\nformation efficiencies and rates are similar to those found during electron\nirradiation of the same ice samples under comparable conditions, suggesting\nthat both UV photons and cosmic rays would have similar contributions to the\nsolid-state formation of these species in space. Finally, the measured\nconversion yields (up to one order of magnitude higher for NH2CHO) suggest that\nin circumstellar environments, where the observed NH2CHO/CH3CHO abundance ratio\nis 0.1, there are likely additional ice and/or gas phase formation pathways for\nCH3CHO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 17:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

Using standard strongly universal hashing to process each\nelement, we get a sketch based estimator where the probability of a too large\nerror is, say, 1/4. By performing $r$ independent repetitions and taking the\nmedian of the estimators, the error probability falls exponentially in $r$.\nHowever, running $r$ independent experiments increases the processing time by a\nfactor $r$.\n  Here we make the point that if we have a hash function with strong\nconcentration bounds, then we get the same high probability bounds without any\nneed for repetitions.

In using synthetic data, one\ncan verify the extent to which source parameters can be recovered and evaluate\nhow various data corruption effects can be calibrated. These studies are\nimportant when proposing observations of new sources, in the characterization\nof the capabilities of new or upgraded instruments, and when verifying\nmodel-based theoretical predictions in a comparison with observational data. We\npresent the SYnthetic Measurement creator for long Baseline Arrays (SYMBA), a\nnovel synthetic data generation pipeline for Very Long Baseline Interferometry\n(VLBI) observations. SYMBA takes into account several realistic atmospheric,\ninstrumental, and calibration effects. We used SYMBA to create synthetic\nobservations for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a mm VLBI array, which has\nrecently captured the first image of a black hole shadow. After testing SYMBA\nwith simple source and corruption models, we study the importance of including\nall corruption and calibration effects. Based on two example general\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) model images of M87, we performed\ncase studies to assess the attainable image quality with the current and future\nEHT array for different weather conditions. The results show that the effects\nof atmospheric and instrumental corruptions on the measured visibilities are\nsignificant. Despite these effects, we demonstrate how the overall structure of\nthe input models can be recovered robustly after performing calibration steps.\nWith the planned addition of new stations to the EHT array, images could be\nreconstructed with higher angular resolution and dynamic range. In our case\nstudy, these improvements allowed for a distinction between a thermal and a\nnon-thermal GRMHD model based on salient features in reconstructed images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 17:34:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Given this minimal input, CenterTrack localizes objects and predicts\ntheir associations with the previous frame. That's it. CenterTrack is simple,\nonline (no peeking into the future), and real-time. It achieves 67.3% MOTA on\nthe MOT17 challenge at 22 FPS and 89.4% MOTA on the KITTI tracking benchmark at\n15 FPS, setting a new state of the art on both datasets. CenterTrack is easily\nextended to monocular 3D tracking by regressing additional 3D attributes. Using\nmonocular video input, it achieves 28.3% AMOTA@0.2 on the newly released\nnuScenes 3D tracking benchmark, substantially outperforming the monocular\nbaseline on this benchmark while running at 28 FPS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 17:58:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 16:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-24"}

The philosophy of\noff-the-shelf approaches lies in the augmentation of unpaired data, i.e. first\ngenerating synthetic low-resolution (LR) images $\\mathcal{Y}^g$ corresponding\nto real-world high-resolution (HR) images $\\mathcal{X}^r$ in the real-world LR\ndomain $\\mathcal{Y}^r$, and then utilizing the pseudo pairs $\\{\\mathcal{Y}^g,\n\\mathcal{X}^r\\}$ for training in a supervised manner. Unfortunately, since\nimage translation itself is an extremely challenging task, the SR performance\nof these approaches are severely limited by the domain gap between generated\nsynthetic LR images and real LR images. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndomain-distance aware super-resolution (DASR) approach for unsupervised\nreal-world image SR. The domain gap between training data (e.g.\n$\\mathcal{Y}^g$) and testing data (e.g. $\\mathcal{Y}^r$) is addressed with our\n\\textbf{domain-gap aware training} and \\textbf{domain-distance weighted\nsupervision} strategies. Domain-gap aware training takes additional benefit\nfrom real data in the target domain while domain-distance weighted supervision\nbrings forward the more rational use of labeled source domain data.

This applies to, for instance, the QCD axion as well as to\nlighter axion-like particles such as fuzzy dark matter. We show that the\ninterference of waves inside a halo inevitably leads to vortices, locations\nwhere chance destructive interference takes the density to zero. The phase of\nthe wavefunction has non-trivial winding around these points. This can be\ninterpreted as a non-zero velocity circulation, so that vortices are sites\nwhere the fluid velocity has a non-vanishing curl. Using analytic arguments and\nnumerical simulations, we study the properties of vortices and show they have a\nnumber of universal features: (1) In three spatial dimensions, the generic\ndefects take the form of vortex rings. (2) On average there is about one vortex\nring per de Broglie volume and (3) generically only single winding ($\\pm 1$)\nvortices are found in a realistic halo.

To gain greater\ninsight into these physical differences, here we use the DR14 Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) and more sensitive, higher resolution radio data from the Very\nLarge Array (VLA) Stripe 82 (S82) and VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz (C3GHz) surveys. With\nthe S82 data, we perform morphological analyses at a resolution and depth three\ntimes that of the FIRST radio survey, and confirm an enhancement in radio-faint\nand compact red quasars over typical quasars; we now also find tentative\nevidence for an enhancement in red quasars with slightly extended radio\nstructures ($16-43$ kpc at $z=1.5$). These analyses are complemented by C3GHz,\nwhich is deep enough to detect radio emission from star-formation processes.\nFrom our data we find that the radio enhancement from red quasars is due to AGN\nactivity on compact scales ($< 43$ kpc) for radio-intermediate-radio-quiet\nsources ($-5<R<-3.4$, where $R=L_{1.4GHz}/L_{6 \\mu m}$), which decreases at\n$R<-5$ as the radio emission from star-formation starts to dilute the AGN\ncomponent. Overall our results argue against a simple orientation scenario and\nare consistent with red quasars representing a younger, earlier phase in the\noverall evolution of quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 12:34:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 09:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-10"}

In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework,\nnamed CogMol (Controlled Generation of Molecules), for designing new drug-like\nsmall molecules targeting novel viral proteins with high affinity and\noff-target selectivity. CogMol combines adaptive pre-training of a molecular\nSMILES Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and an efficient multi-attribute\ncontrolled sampling scheme that uses guidance from attribute predictors trained\non latent features. To generate novel and optimal drug-like molecules for\nunseen viral targets, CogMol leverages a protein-molecule binding affinity\npredictor that is trained using SMILES VAE embeddings and protein sequence\nembeddings learned unsupervised from a large corpus. CogMol framework is\napplied to three SARS-CoV-2 target proteins: main protease, receptor-binding\ndomain of the spike protein, and non-structural protein 9 replicase. The\ngenerated candidates are novel at both molecular and chemical scaffold levels\nwhen compared to the training data. CogMol also includes insilico screening for\nassessing toxicity of parent molecules and their metabolites with a multi-task\ntoxicity classifier, synthetic feasibility with a chemical retrosynthesis\npredictor, and target structure binding with docking simulations. Docking\nreveals favorable binding of generated molecules to the target protein\nstructure, where 87-95 % of high affinity molecules showed docking free energy\n< -6 kcal/mol. When compared to approved drugs, the majority of designed\ncompounds show low parent molecule and metabolite toxicity and high synthetic\nfeasibility. In summary, CogMol handles multi-constraint design of\nsynthesizable, low-toxic, drug-like molecules with high target specificity and\nselectivity, and does not need target-dependent fine-tuning of the framework or\ntarget structure information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 18:17:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 00:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-25"}

Undetected\ntransmissions present a remarkable challenge for the containment of the virus\nand pose an appalling threat to the public. An urgent question that has been\nasked by the public is \"Should I be tested for COVID-19 if I am sick?\". While\ndifferent regions established their own criteria for screening infected cases,\nthe screening criteria have been modified based on new evidence and\nunderstanding of the virus as well as the availability of resources. The\nshortage of test kits and medical personnel has considerably limited our\nability to do as many tests as possible. Public health officials and clinicians\nare facing a dilemma of balancing the limited resources and unlimited demands.\nOn one hand, they are striving to achieve the best outcome by optimizing the\nusage of the scant resources. On the other hand, they are challenged by the\npatients' frustrations and anxieties, stemming from the concerns of not being\ntested for COVID-19 for not meeting the definition of PUI (person under\ninvestigation).

We find that the\npopulation-wide distributions of core properties are relatively invariant in\ntime, and quantities like the core mass function match with observations.\nDespite this consistency, an individual core may undergo large (>40%),\nstochastic variations due to the redefinition of the dendrogram structure\nbetween timesteps.

This\nwork reinforces that there is no time-stable density contour that defines a\nstar-forming core. The dendrogram itself can induce significant structure\nvariation between timesteps due to small changes in the density field.

Building on the prior work on cough-based\ndiagnosis of respiratory diseases, we propose, develop and test an Artificial\nIntelligence (AI)-powered screening solution for COVID-19 infection that is\ndeployable via a smartphone app. The app, named AI4COVID-19 records and sends\nthree 3-second cough sounds to an AI engine running in the cloud, and returns a\nresult within two minutes. Methods: Cough is a symptom of over thirty\nnon-COVID-19 related medical conditions. This makes the diagnosis of a COVID-19\ninfection by cough alone an extremely challenging multidisciplinary problem. We\naddress this problem by investigating the distinctness of pathomorphological\nalterations in the respiratory system induced by COVID-19 infection when\ncompared to other respiratory infections. To overcome the COVID-19 cough\ntraining data shortage we exploit transfer learning. To reduce the misdiagnosis\nrisk stemming from the complex dimensionality of the problem, we leverage a\nmulti-pronged mediator centered risk-averse AI architecture. Results: Results\nshow AI4COVID-19 can distinguish among COVID-19 coughs and several types of\nnon-COVID-19 coughs. The accuracy is promising enough to encourage a\nlarge-scale collection of labeled cough data to gauge the generalization\ncapability of AI4COVID-19. AI4COVID-19 is not a clinical grade testing tool.\nInstead, it offers a screening tool deployable anytime, anywhere, by anyone.

Most of today's autonomous\ndriving datasets contain only a few trajectories per location and are recorded\nwith test vehicles that are cautiously driven by trained drivers. In particular\nin interactive scenarios such as highway merges, the test driver's behavior\nsignificantly influences other vehicles. This influence prevents recording the\nwhole traffic space of human driving behavior. In this work, we present a novel\nmethodology to extract trajectories of traffic objects using infrastructure\nsensors. Infrastructure sensors allow us to record a lot of data for one\nlocation and take the test drivers out of the loop. We develop both a hardware\nsetup consisting of a camera and a traffic surveillance radar and a trajectory\nextraction algorithm. Our vision pipeline accurately detects objects, fuses\ncamera and radar detections and tracks them over time. We improve a\nstate-of-the-art object tracker by combining the tracking in image coordinates\nwith a Kalman filter in road coordinates. We show that our sensor fusion\napproach successfully combines the advantages of camera and radar detections\nand outperforms either single sensor. Finally, we also evaluate the accuracy of\nour trajectory extraction pipeline. For that, we equip our test vehicle with a\ndifferential GPS sensor and use it to collect ground truth trajectories. With\nthis data we compute the measurement errors. While we use the mean error to\nde-bias the trajectories, the error standard deviation is in the magnitude of\nthe ground truth data inaccuracy. Hence, the extracted trajectories are not\nonly naturalistic but also highly accurate and prove the potential of using\ninfrastructure sensors to extract real-world trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 22:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-06"}

A key challenge for\nthe novel view synthesis arises from dynamic scene reconstruction where\nepipolar geometry does not apply to the local motion of dynamic contents. To\naddress this challenge, we propose to combine the depth from single view (DSV)\nand the depth from multi-view stereo (DMV), where DSV is complete, i.e., a\ndepth is assigned to every pixel, yet view-variant in its scale, while DMV is\nview-invariant yet incomplete. Our insight is that although its scale and\nquality are inconsistent with other views, the depth estimation from a single\nview can be used to reason about the globally coherent geometry of dynamic\ncontents. We cast this problem as learning to correct the scale of DSV, and to\nrefine each depth with locally consistent motions between views to form a\ncoherent depth estimation. We integrate these tasks into a depth fusion network\nin a self-supervised fashion. Given the fused depth maps, we synthesize a\nphotorealistic virtual view in a specific location and time with our deep\nblending network that completes the scene and renders the virtual view. We\nevaluate our method of depth estimation and view synthesis on diverse\nreal-world dynamic scenes and show the outstanding performance over existing\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 22:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-06"}

It has been in the low-activity state in the optical since 2013, with\nsome rebrightening from the end of 2015 to the beginning of 2016, after which\nit remained dormant. We aim to study the photometric and spectral variability\nof NGC 3516 from the new observations in U- and B-bands and examine the\nprofiles of the optical broad emission lines in order to demonstrate that this\nobject may be entering a new state of activity. NGC 3516 has been monitored\nintensively for the past 4 months with an automated telescope in U and B\nfilters, enabling accurate photometry of 0.01 precision. Spectral observations\nwere triggered when an increase in brightness was spotted. We support our\nanalysis of past-episodes of violent variability with the UV and X-ray\nlong-term light curves constructed from the archival Swift data. An increase of\nthe photometric magnitude is seen in both U and B filters to a maximum\namplitude of 0.25mag and 0.1 mag, respectively. During the flare, we observe\nstronger forbidden high-ionization iron lines than reported before, as well as\nthe complex broad Ha and Hb lines.

The trends in the optical, UV, and\nX-ray light curves are similar, with the amplitudes of variability being\nsignificantly larger in the case of UV and X-ray bands. The increase of the\ncontinuum emission, the variability of the coronal lines, and the very broad\ncomponent in the Balmer lines may indicate that the AGN of NGC 3516 is finally\nleaving the low-activity state in which it has been for the last ~3 years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 23:55:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 14:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

To address this issue, we propose a novel system that explicitly\ndisentangles scale from the network estimation. Instead of relying on PoseNet\narchitecture, our method recovers relative pose by directly solving fundamental\nmatrix from dense optical flow correspondence and makes use of a two-view\ntriangulation module to recover an up-to-scale 3D structure. Then, we align the\nscale of the depth prediction with the triangulated point cloud and use the\ntransformed depth map for depth error computation and dense reprojection check.\nOur whole system can be jointly trained end-to-end.

The ISP then applies a\nseries of nonlinear color manipulations to enhance the visual quality of the\nfinal sRGB image.

The DL CSI is usually measured at mobile stations\n(MSs) through DL training and fed back to the BS in frequency division\nduplexing (FDD). The DL training and uplink (UL) feedback might become\ninfeasible due to insufficient coherence time interval when the channel rapidly\nchanges due to high speed of MSs. Without the feedback from MSs, it may be\npossible for the BS to directly obtain the DL CSI using the inherent relation\nof UL and DL channels even in FDD, which is called DL extrapolation. Although\nthe exact relation would be highly nonlinear, previous studies have shown that\na neural network (NN) can be used to estimate the DL CSI from the UL CSI at the\nBS. Most of previous works on this line of research trained the NN using full\ndimensional UL and DL channels; however, the NN training complexity becomes\nsevere as the number of antennas at the BS increases. To reduce the training\ncomplexity and improve DL CSI estimation quality, this paper proposes a novel\nDL extrapolation technique using simplified input and output of the NN. It is\nshown through many measurement campaigns that the UL and DL channels still\nshare common components like path delays and angles in FDD. The proposed\ntechnique first extracts these common coefficients from the UL and DL channels\nand trains the NN only using the path gains, which depend on frequency bands,\nwith reduced dimension compared to the full UL and DL channels. Extensive\nsimulation results show that the proposed technique outperforms the\nconventional approach, which relies on the full UL and DL channels to train the\nNN, regardless of the speed of MSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 04:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

Various DG approaches have been proposed with different\nmotivating intuitions, but they typically optimize for a single step of domain\ngeneralization -- training on one set of domains and generalizing to one other.\nOur sequential learning is inspired by the idea lifelong learning, where\naccumulated experience means that learning the $n^{th}$ thing becomes easier\nthan the $1^{st}$ thing. In DG this means encountering a sequence of domains\nand at each step training to maximise performance on the next domain. The\nperformance at domain $n$ then depends on the previous $n-1$ learning problems.\nThus backpropagating through the sequence means optimizing performance not just\nfor the next domain, but all following domains. Training on all such sequences\nof domains provides dramatically more `practice' for a base DG learner compared\nto existing approaches, thus improving performance on a true testing domain.\nThis strategy can be instantiated for different base DG algorithms, but we\nfocus on its application to the recently proposed Meta-Learning Domain\ngeneralization (MLDG).

In this paper, we present an end-to-end\ntrainable deep segmentation model termed Crossover-Net for robust segmentation\nin medical images. Our proposed model is inspired by an insightful observation:\nduring segmentation, the representation from the horizontal and vertical\ndirections can provide different local appearance and orthogonality context\ninformation, which helps enhance the discrimination between different tissues\nby simultaneously learning from these two directions. Specifically, by\nconverting the segmentation task to a pixel/voxel-wise prediction problem,\nfirstly, we originally propose a cross-shaped patch, namely crossover-patch,\nwhich consists of a pair of (orthogonal and overlapped) vertical and horizontal\npatches, to capture the orthogonal vertical and horizontal relation. Then, we\ndevelop the Crossover-Net to learn the vertical-horizontal crossover relation\ncaptured by our crossover-patches. To achieve this goal, for learning the\nrepresentation on a typical crossover-patch, we design a novel loss function to\n(1) impose the consistency on the overlap region of the vertical and horizontal\npatches and (2) preserve the diversity on their non-overlap regions.

It normally\nconsiders both short-range motions and long-range aggregations. In this paper,\nwe propose a Temporal Excitation and Aggregation (TEA) block, including a\nmotion excitation (ME) module and a multiple temporal aggregation (MTA) module,\nspecifically designed to capture both short- and long-range temporal evolution.\nIn particular, for short-range motion modeling, the ME module calculates the\nfeature-level temporal differences from spatiotemporal features. It then\nutilizes the differences to excite the motion-sensitive channels of the\nfeatures. The long-range temporal aggregations in previous works are typically\nachieved by stacking a large number of local temporal convolutions. Each\nconvolution processes a local temporal window at a time. In contrast, the MTA\nmodule proposes to deform the local convolution to a group of sub-convolutions,\nforming a hierarchical residual architecture. Without introducing additional\nparameters, the features will be processed with a series of sub-convolutions,\nand each frame could complete multiple temporal aggregations with\nneighborhoods. The final equivalent receptive field of temporal dimension is\naccordingly enlarged, which is capable of modeling the long-range temporal\nrelationship over distant frames. The two components of the TEA block are\ncomplementary in temporal modeling. Finally, our approach achieves impressive\nresults at low FLOPs on several action recognition benchmarks, such as\nKinetics, Something-Something, HMDB51, and UCF101, which confirms its\neffectiveness and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 06:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-06"}

We argue that such spin anisotropy is induced by the spin-orbit coupling\nin the spin-vortex-type fluctuations of this unique compound. The spin\nanisotropy is strongly affected by the superconductivity, where it is weak\nbelow 6 meV in the normal state and then transferred to higher energy and\nfurther enhanced in the odd mode of spin resonance below $T_c$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 07:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

Disassembling thus\nfinds its application in a wide domain such as image editing and few- or\nzero-shot learning, as it enables category-specific modularity in the learned\nrepresentations. To this end, we propose an unsupervised approach to achieving\ndisassembling, named Unsupervised Disassembling Object Representation (UDOR).\nUDOR follows a double auto-encoder architecture, in which a fuzzy\nclassification and an object-removing operation are imposed. The fuzzy\nclassification constrains each part of the latent representation to encode\nfeatures of up to one object category, while the object-removing, combined with\na generative adversarial network, enforces the modularity of the\nrepresentations and integrity of the reconstructed image. Furthermore, we\ndevise two metrics to respectively measure the modularity of disassembled\nrepresentations and the visual integrity of reconstructed images.

Indeed, SARS-CoV-2\nexhibits a relatively long incubation period, in which individuals experience\nno symptoms, but may already contribute to the spread. Unable to selectively\nisolate these invisible spreaders, we resort to population-wide restrictions.\nHowever, under the alternating quarantine routine, if an individual was exposed\nduring their active week, by the time they complete their quarantine they will,\nin most cases, begin to exhibit symptoms.

Our model is based on the formation and diffusion of neutral\nlithium atoms, which carry electrons through the SEI. Recent short- and\nlong-term experiments provide validation for our model. We show that SEI growth\nis either reaction, diffusion, or migration limited. For the first time, we\nmodel the transition between these mechanisms and explain empirically derived\ncapacity fade models of the form $\\Delta Q\\propto t^\\beta$ with $0 \\leq \\beta\n\\leq 1$. Based on our model, we identify critical operation conditions\naccelerating SEI growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 10:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

Most existing methods\npursue robust and unbiased solutions either through learning discriminative\nfeatures, or reweighting samples. We argue what is more desirable is learning\ngradually to discriminate like our human beings, and hence we resort to\nself-paced learning (SPL). Then, a natural question arises: can self-paced\nregime lead deep discriminative models to achieve more robust and less biased\nsolutions? To this end, this paper proposes a new deep discriminative\nmodel--self-paced deep regression forests with consideration on\nunderrepresented examples (SPUDRFs). It tackles the fundamental ranking and\nselecting problem in SPL from a new perspective: fairness. This paradigm is\nfundamental and could be easily combined with a variety of deep discriminative\nmodels (DDMs).

It is a phenomenon where a\nsignificant number of latent variables fail to capture any information about\nthe input data and the corresponding hidden units become inactive. This\nadversely affects learning diverse and interpretable latent representations. As\nvariational graph autoencoder (VGAE) extends VAE for graph-structured data, it\ninherits the over-pruning problem. In this paper, we adopt a model based\napproach and propose epitomic VGAE (EVGAE),a generative variational framework\nfor graph datasets which successfully mitigates the over-pruning problem and\nalso boosts the generative ability of VGAE. We consider EVGAE to consist of\nmultiple sparse VGAE models, called epitomes, that are groups of latent\nvariables sharing the latent space. This approach aids in increasing active\nunits as epitomes compete to learn better representation of the graph data. We\nverify our claims via experiments on three benchmark datasets.

However, the COVID-19 pneumonia has concealed\nsymptoms: the first symptom may not be fever, and can be shortness of breath.\nDuring epidemic prevention, many people tend to wear masks. Therefore, in this\ndemo paper, we proposed a portable non-contact healthy screening system for\npeople wearing masks, which can simultaneously obtain body temperature and\nrespiration state. This system consists of three modules viz. thermal image\ncollection module, health indicator calculation module and health assessment\nmodule.

Then, body temperature and\nrespiration state are extracted from the video and are imported into the\nfollowing health assessment module. Finally, the screening result can be\nobtained.

In this work, we rely on previous experimental findings to\nbuild a theoretical model based on two cooperation driving mechanisms:\nsecond-order reputation and memory. Specifically, taking the Donation Game as a\nstarting point, the agents are distributed among three strategies, namely\nUnconditional Cooperators, Unconditional Defectors, and Discriminators, where\nthe latter follow a second-order assessment rule: Shunning, Stern Judging,\nImage Scoring, or Simple Standing. A discriminator will cooperate if the\nevaluation of the recipient's last actions contained in his memory is above a\nthreshold of (in)tolerance. In addition to the dynamics inherent to the game,\nanother imitation dynamics, involving much longer times (generations), is\nintroduced. The model is approached through a mean-field approximation that\npredicts the macroscopic behavior observed in Monte Carlo simulations. We found\nthat, while in most second-order assessment rules, intolerance hinders\ncooperation, it has the opposite (positive) effect under the Simple Standing\nrule. Furthermore, we show that, when considering memory, the Stern Judging\nrule shows the lowest values of cooperation, while stricter rules show higher\ncooperation levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 11:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

A plateau phase, following an\ninitial decline, is seen in the NUV and optical u, g, r, i light curves.\nMoreover, we find possible evidence that the plateau phase in the NUV band may\nlag behind the optical ones by approximately 70-80 days with also a much\nshorter duration, i.e. $\\sim$7-15 days against $\\sim$40-50 days.

The plateaus can be explained if the stellar streams\ncollide with the pre-existing AGN disk at different radii. Though the overall\nfallback rate decreases, the material in the outer disk gradually drifts inward\nand increases the local accretion rate at the inner region, producing the\noptical and UV plateaus.

The famous Erd\\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem answered both direct and\ninverse problems and led the era of studying intersection problems for finite\nsets.\n  In this paper, we consider the following quantitative intersection problem\nwhich can be viewed an inverse problem for Erd\\H{o}s-Ko-Rado type theorems: For\n$\\mathcal{F}\\subseteq {[n]\\choose k}$, define its \\emph{total intersection} as\n$\\mathcal{I}(\\mathcal{F})=\\sum_{F_1,F_2\\in \\mathcal{F}}|F_1\\cap F_2|$.

The ability of such scale channel networks\nto generalise to scales not present in the training set over significant scale\nranges has, however, not previously been explored. We, therefore, present a\ntheoretical analysis of invariance and covariance properties of scale channel\nnetworks and perform an experimental evaluation of the ability of different\ntypes of scale channel networks to generalise to previously unseen scales. We\nidentify limitations of previous approaches and propose a new type of foveated\nscale channel architecture, where the scale channels process increasingly\nlarger parts of the image with decreasing resolution. Our proposed FovMax and\nFovAvg networks perform almost identically over a scale range of 8, also when\ntraining on single scale training data, and do also give improvements in the\nsmall sample regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 13:00:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 19:04:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 10:14:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 13:06:41 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 12:32:33 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 09:07:54 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 09:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

These absolute O and H density measurements, at the nozzle of\nthe plasma jet, are used to benchmark a plug-flow, 0D chemical kinetics model,\nfor varying humidity content, to further investigate the main formation\npathways of O and H. It is found that impurities can play a crucial role for\nthe production of O at small molecular admixtures. Hence, for controllable\nreactive species production, purposely admixed molecules to the feed gas is\nrecommended, as opposed to relying on ambient molecules. The controlled\nhumidity content was also identified as an effective tailoring mechanism for\nthe O/H ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 13:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

Focus is placed on the jamming\nfronts that exist in such systems. The literature has concentrated on the\npropagation of the jammed region under pushing, pulling or shearing conditions\nindependently. How the different fronts interact and if the fronts are\nsymmetric when generated simultaneously has remained unexplored. Investigating\nthis is our main goal. With the current setup, we are able to view a\ncontinuous, quasi-2D field around the cylinder. As such, a new way of\ngenerating jamming fronts is presented whereby pushing, pulling and shearing\ncan be examined simultaneously. In agreement with previous studies, the front\npropagates roughly twice as fast in the longitudinal direction compared to the\ntransverse direction, which is attributed to a single underlying onset strain,\nregardless of orientation from the cylinder. Although the jamming front shows\nnearly perfect transverse symmetry, there is clear longitudinal asymmetry. This\nis evident in the velocity and strain fields, and is also detectable in the\nfront propagation velocity and onset strain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 13:58:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 15:03:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 07:34:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:22:57 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 08:41:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

It causes proliferation of vessels in the\nretina and could result in vision loss and, eventually, retinal detachment,\nleading to blindness. While human experts can easily identify severe stages of\nROP, the diagnosis of earlier stages, which are the most relevant to\ndetermining treatment choice, are much more affected by variability in\nsubjective interpretations of human experts. In recent years, there has been a\nsignificant effort to automate the diagnosis using deep learning. This paper\nbuilds upon the success of previous models and develops a novel architecture,\nwhich combines object segmentation and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to\nconstruct an effective classifier of ROP stages 1-3 based on neonatal retinal\nimages. Motivated by the fact that the formation and shape of a demarcation\nline in the retina is the distinguishing feature between earlier ROP stages,\nour proposed system first trains an object segmentation model to identify the\ndemarcation line at a pixel level and adds the resulting mask as an additional\n\"color\" channel in the original image. Then, the system trains a CNN classifier\nbased on the processed images to leverage information from both the original\nimage and the mask, which helps direct the model's attention to the demarcation\nline. In a number of careful experiments comparing its performance to previous\nobject segmentation systems and CNN-only systems trained on our dataset, our\nnovel architecture significantly outperforms previous systems in accuracy,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 14:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-06"}

The\nassessment and quantification of PNI is; however, labor intensive. In the study\nwe aimed to develop an algorithm based on deep neural networks to aid\npathologists in this task.\n  Methods: We collected, digitized and pixel-wise annotated the PNI findings in\neach of the approximately 80,000 biopsy cores from the 7,406 men who underwent\nbiopsy in the prospective and diagnostic STHLM3 trial between 2012 and 2014. In\ntotal, 485 biopsy cores showed PNI. We also digitized more than 10% (n=8,318)\nof the PNI negative biopsy cores. Digitized biopsies from a random selection of\n80% of the men were used to build deep neural networks, and the remaining 20%\nwere used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.\n  Results: For the detection of PNI in prostate biopsy cores the network had an\nestimated area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.98 (95%\nCI 0.97-0.99) based on 106 PNI positive cores and 1,652 PNI negative cores in\nthe independent test set.

Among the\nsystems with a disk-like structure, 20% show a resolved dust-free cavity. The\nimage reconstruction process is a powerful tool to reveal complex disk inner\nrim morphologies. At the angular resolution reached by near-infrared\ninterferometric observations, most of the images are compatible with a\ncentrally peaked emission (no cavity). For the most resolved targets, image\nreconstruction reveals morphologies that cannot be reproduced by generic\nparametric models. Moreover, the nonaxisymmetric disks show that the spatial\nresolution probed by optical interferometers makes the observations of the\nnear-infrared emission sensitive to temporal evolution with a time-scale down\nto a few weeks. The evidence of nonaxisymmetric emission that cannot be\nexplained by simple inclination and radiative transfer effects requires\nalternative explanations, such as a warping of the inner disks.

In this work we overcome these issues by\npresenting a model agnostic saliency mapping framework tailored to medical\nimaging.

We\nformulate saliency attribution as a map-quality optimization task, enforcing\nconstrained and focused attributions.

Also, the author constructed a family\nof 2-generated restricted Lie algebras of slow polynomial growth with a nil\n$p$-mapping.\n  Now, we construct a family of so called clover 3-generated restricted Lie\nalgebras $T(\\Xi)$, where a field of positive characteristic is arbitrary and\n$\\Xi$ an infinite tuple of positive integers. We prove that $1\\le\n\\mathrm{GKdim}T(\\Xi)\\le3$, moreover, the set of Gelfand-Kirillov dimensions of\nclover Lie algebras with constant tuples is dense on $[1,3]$. We construct a\nsubfamily of non-isomorphic nil restricted Lie algebras $T(\\Xi_{q,\\kappa})$,\nwhere $q\\in\\mathbb N$, $\\kappa\\in\\mathbb R^+$, with extremely slow quasi-linear\ngrowth of type:\n$\\gamma_{T(\\Xi_{q,\\kappa})}(m)=m\\big(\\ln^{(q)}\\!m\\big)^{\\kappa+o(1)}$, as\n$m\\to\\infty$.\n  The present research is motivated by a construction by Kassabov and Pak of\ngroups of oscillating growth. As an analogue, we construct nil restricted Lie\nalgebras of intermediate oscillating growth in another paper. We call them\n\"Phoenix algebras\" because, for infinitely many periods of time, the algebra is\n\"almost dying\" by having a \"quasi-linear\" growth as above, for infinitely many\n$n$ the growth function behaves like $\\exp(n/(\\ln n)^{\\lambda})$, for such\nperiods the algebra is \"resuscitating\". The present construction of 3-generated\nnil restricted Lie algebras of quasi-linear growth is an important part of that\nresult, responsible for the lower quasi-linear growth in that construction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 15:56:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 18:58:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2020 17:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

A recent debate focused on\nthe effects of unconventional policies aimed at achieving both price and\nfinancial stability. In particular, Quantitative Easing (QE, i.e., the\nlarge-scale asset purchase programme conducted by a central bank upon the\ncreation of new money) has been recently implemented by the European Central\nBank (ECB). In this context, two questions deserve more attention in the\nliterature. First, to what extent, by injecting liquidity, the QE may alter the\nbank-firm lending level and stimulate the real economy. Second, to what extent\nthe QE may also alter the pattern of intra-financial exposures among financial\nactors (including banks, investment funds, insurance corporations, and pension\nfunds) and what are the implications in terms of financial stability. Here, we\naddress these two questions by developing a methodology to map the\nmacro-network of financial exposures among institutional sectors across\nfinancial instruments (e.g., equity, bonds, and loans) and we illustrate our\napproach on recently available data (i.e., data on loans and private and public\nsecurities purchased within the QE).
