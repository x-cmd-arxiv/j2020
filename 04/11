This approach is capable of\nproviding a detailed description of the microscopic vortex dynamics and in turn\nimportant insights into the microwave field amplitude dependence of the vortex\nsurface resistance. The numerical simulations are compared against experimental\ndata of vortex surface resistance at high microwave amplitude measured by means\nof bulk niobium superconducting-radio frequency cavities operating at 1.3 GHz.\nThe good qualitative agreement of simulations and experiments suggests that the\nnon-linear dependence of the trapped flux surface resistance with the microwave\nfield amplitude is generated by progressive microwave depinning and vortex\njumps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 16:05:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 15:54:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-15"}

In this paper, we propose a\nmathematical framework for the first-order analysis of the effects caused by\nmicro-mobility on the capacity and outage in terahertz communications. The\nperformance of terahertz communications is compared with and without\nmicro-mobility illustrating the difference of up to 1 Tbit/s or 75%. In\nresponse to this gap, it is finally shown how the negative effects of the\nmicro-mobility can be partially addressed by a proper adjustment of the\nterahertz antenna arrays and the period of beam realignment procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 16:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-13"}

This approach better protects the personal\nsphere of citizens and affords multiple benefits: it allows for detailed\ninformation gathering for infected people in a privacy-preserving fashion; and,\nin turn this enables both contact tracing, and, the early detection of outbreak\nhotspots on more finely-granulated geographic scale.

First to extend existing decentralized architectures with a light\ntouch, in order to manage the collection of location data locally on the\ndevice, and allow the user to share spatio-temporal aggregates - if and when\nthey want, for specific aims - with health authorities, for instance.

The individual pattern transformations, and\nconsequently also spatially distributed patterns, can be induced by controlling\nthe applied compression along two orthogonal directions. Exploitation of this\nproperty holds great potential in, e.g., soft robotics applications. For fast\nand optimal design, efficient numerical tools are required, capable of bridging\nthe gap between the microstructural and engineering scale, while capturing all\nrelevant pattern transformations. A micromorphic homogenization framework for\nmaterials exhibiting multiple pattern transformations is therefore presented in\nthis paper, which extends the micromorphic scheme of Roko\\v{s} et al., J.

However, theoretical and rigorous\nanalysis for such phase-locking dynamics of the Kuramoto flow still lacks a\ncomplete understanding, although there were some recent progress on the\ncomplete synchronization of the Kuramoto model in a sufficiently large coupling\nstrength regime. In this paper, we present sufficient frameworks for partial\nphase-locking of a majority ensemble and the complete phase-locking in terms of\nthe initial phase configuration, coupling strength and natural frequencies. As\na by-product of our analysis, we obtain nontrivial upper bounds for the\npathwise critical coupling strength in terms of the diameter of natural\nfrequencies, initial Kuramoto order parameter and the system size $N$. We also\nshow that phase-locked states whose order parameters are less than\n$N^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ are linearly unstable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 22:58:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Here, we\ndemonstrate an enhanced quantum protocol for molecular state detection using\nstate-dependent forces. Our approach is based on interfering a reference and a\nsignal force applied to a single atomic and molecular ion, respectively, in\norder to extract their relative phase. We use this phase information to\nidentify states embedded in a dense molecular energy-level structure and to\nmonitor state-to-state inelastic scattering processes. This method can also be\nused to exclude a large number of states in a single measurement when the\ninitial state preparation is imperfect and information on the molecular\nproperties is incomplete. While the present experiments focus on N$_2^+$, the\nmethod is general and is expected to be of particular benefit for polyatomic\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2020 04:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

Recent\nworks show that a polynomially decaying prior leads to satisfactory posterior\nasymptotics under regression models. In the literature, statisticians have\ninvestigated how the global shrinkage parameter, i.e., the scale parameter, in\na heavy tail prior affects the posterior contraction. In this work, we explore\nhow the shape of the prior, or more specifically, the polynomial order of the\nprior tail affects the posterior. We discover that, under the sparse normal\nmeans models, the polynomial order does affect the multiplicative constant of\nthe posterior contraction rate. More importantly, if the polynomial order is\nsufficiently close to 1, it will induce the optimal Bayesian posterior\nconvergence, in the sense that the Bayesian contraction rate is sharply\nminimax, i.e., not only the order, but also the multiplicative constant of the\nposterior contraction rate are optimal. The above Bayesian sharp minimaxity\nholds when the global shrinkage parameter follows a deterministic choice which\ndepends on the unknown sparsity $s$. Therefore, a Beta-prior modeling is\nfurther proposed, such that our sharply minimax Bayesian procedure is adaptive\nto unknown $s$. Our theoretical discoveries are justified by simulation\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2020 05:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

Typical force closure models require\ncomputation of the slip velocity at the particle location, which in turn\nrequires accurate estimation of the undisturbed fluid velocity. However, when\nthe fluid and particle phases are two-way coupled the fluid velocity field is\ndisturbed by the presence of the particle. A common practice is to use the\ndisturbed velocity to compute the particle force which can result in errors as\nmuch as 100% in predicting the particle dynamics. In this work, a general\nvelocity correction scheme is developed that facilitates accurate estimation of\nthe undisturbed fluid velocity in particle-laden fluid flows with and without\nno-slip walls. The model can handle particles of different size, arbitrary\ninterpolation functions, anisotropic grids with large aspect ratios, and\nwall-bounded flows. The present correction scheme is motivated by the recent\nwork of Esmaily & Horwitz (JCP, 2018) on unbounded particle-laden flows.\nModifications necessary for wall-bounded flows are developed such that the\nundisturbed fluid velocity at any wall distance is accurately recovered,\nasymptotically approaching the unbounded scheme for particles far away from\nwalls. A detailed series of verification tests were conducted on settling\nvelocity of a particle in parallel and perpendicular motions to a no-slip wall.\nA range of flow parameters and grid configurations; involving anisotropic grids\nwith aspect ratios typically encountered in particle-laden turbulent channel\nflows, were considered in detail.

To accurately model dense sprays, one needs to\ncapture this effect by taking into account the spatio-temporal changes in the\nvolume fraction of the carrier phase due to the motion and presence of the\ndispersed phase. This leads to zero-Mach number, variable density equations\nwhich are commonly neglected in the standard two-way coupling spray\nsimulations. Using pressure-based solvers, this gives rise to a source term in\nthe pressure Poisson equation and a non-divergence free velocity field. To\nvalidate the predictive capability of such approach, an atomized\nnon-evaporating dilute particulate round jet is first examined using Large Eddy\nSimulation coupled with Point-Particle approach and then higher volume loadings\nup to 38% are investigated with and without taking into account the volumetric\ndisplacement effects. It is shown that for volume loadings above 5%, the\nvolumetric displacement effects enhance dynamics of the flow resulting in a\nhigher stream-wise mean and r.m.s. velocities compared to the results of\nstandard two-way coupling. This is more pronounced for the near field of the\njet where local volume fraction of the dispersed phase is relatively high. This\nenhancement is conjectured to be due to the velocity divergence effect due to\nthe modified continuity equation where spatio-temporal variations in volume\nfraction of the carrier phase increases velocity in the regions of high void\nfraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2020 06:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

Complex network theories have some\nadvantages in analyzing global oil trade as a system with numerous economies\nand complicated relationships.

In this perspective, we attempt to retrospect\nelectron behaviours during the whole OER process, with the consideration of\nspin attribute. Regardless of the adopted mechanisms by different\nelectrocatalysts, for example, adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) or lattice\noxygen mechanism (LOM), the underlying rationale is that active sites have to\nextract three in four electrons with the same spin direction before the\nformation of O=O. This spin-sensitive nature of OER superimposes additional\nhigh requirements on the electrocatalysts, especially on the spin structure, to\ncompliment the fast electron transfer in the interface with spin selection and\nsmoothly delivery afterwards. When optimizing the geometric and electronic\nstructures catering for the spin-sensitive OER, awareness of the couplings\nbetween spin, charge, orbital and lattice is necessary. Some spin-correlated\nphysical properties, such as (1) crystal field, (2) coordination, (3)\noxidation, (4) bonding, (5) eg electron number, (6) conductivity and (7)\nmagnetism, are also discussed briefly.

This paper explores a different design style, where each unit is\nonly responsible for a slice of the bit-level operations to interleave and\ncombine the benefits of bit-level parallelism with the abundant data-level\nparallelism in deep neural networks. A dynamic collection of these units\ncooperate at runtime to generate bits of the results, collectively. Such\ncooperation requires extracting new grouping between the bits, which is only\npossible if the operands and operations are vectorizable. The abundance of Data\nLevel Parallelism and mostly repeated execution patterns, provides a unique\nopportunity to define and leverage this new dimension of Bit-Parallel Vector\nComposability. This design intersperses bit parallelism within data-level\nparallelism and dynamically interweaves the two together.

Higher-order\n(in screened Coulomb interaction $W$) self-energy diagrams lead to improved\nelectron spectral functions (SF) by taking more complicated scattering channels\ninto account and by adding corrections to lower order self-energy terms.\nHowever, they also may lead to unphysical negative spectral function.

In particular, we determined the electron-phonon relaxation time in\nCuMnAs. We also observed that for a local film heating by a focused laser the\nthinner films are heated more, but the heat is dissipated considerably faster\nthan in the case of thicker films. This illustrates that the optical pump-probe\nexperiment is a valuable characterization tool for the heat management\noptimization in the CuMnAs memory devices and can be applied in a similar way\nto those used during heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology\ndevelopment for the latest generation of hard drive disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2020 10:15:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 16:47:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

We use Isovist Analysis, which\nis a popular space syntax technique, to turn qualitative object attributes into\nquantitative environmental information. Since isovists are location-specific\npatterns of visibility, a sequence of isovists describes the spatial perception\nduring a movement along multiple points in space. We then use Bayesian Surprise\nin a feature space consisting of these isovist readings. To demonstrate the\nsuitability of our approach, we take \"snapshots\" of an agent's local\nenvironment to provide a short list of images that characterize a traversed\ntrajectory through a 2D indoor environment. Those fingerprints represent\nsurprising regions of a tour, characterize the traversed map and enable indoor\nLBS to focus more on important regions. Given this idea, we propose to use\n\"surprise\" as a new dimension of context in indoor location-based services\n(LBS).

Early diagnosis is crucial in providing\nintervention for patients suffering from cardiac arrhythmia. Traditionally,\ndiagnosis is performed by examination of the Electrocardiogram (ECG) by a\ncardiologist. This method of diagnosis is hampered by the lack of accessibility\nto expert cardiologists. For quite some time, signal processing methods had\nbeen used to automate arrhythmia diagnosis. However, these traditional methods\nrequire expert knowledge and are unable to model a wide range of arrhythmia.\nRecently, Deep Learning methods have provided solutions to performing\narrhythmia diagnosis at scale. However, the black-box nature of these models\nprohibit clinical interpretation of cardiac arrhythmia. There is a dire need to\ncorrelate the obtained model outputs to the corresponding segments of the ECG.\nTo this end, two methods are proposed to provide interpretability to the\nmodels. The first method is a novel application of Gradient-weighted Class\nActivation Map (Grad-CAM) for visualizing the saliency of the CNN model. In the\nsecond approach, saliency is derived by learning the input deletion mask for\nthe LSTM model. The visualizations are provided on a model whose competence is\nestablished by comparisons against baselines. The results of model saliency not\nonly provide insight into the prediction capability of the model but also\naligns with the medical literature for the classification of cardiac\narrhythmia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2020 13:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

A malicious attacker is\nable to arbitrarily manipulate the observations for a time-varying and unknown\nsubset of the sensors. We first propose a recursive distributed filter\nconsisting of two steps at each update. The first step employs a\nsaturation-like scheme, which gives a small gain if the innovation is large\ncorresponding to a potential attack. The second step is a consensus operation\nof state estimates among neighboring sensors. We prove the estimation error is\nupper bounded if the filter parameters satisfy a condition. We further analyze\nthe feasibility of the condition and connect it to sparse observability in the\ncentralized case. When the attacked sensor set is known to be time-invariant,\nthe secured filter is modified by adding an online local attack detector. The\ndetector is able to identify the attacked sensors whose observation innovations\nare larger than the detection thresholds. Also, with more attacked sensors\nbeing detected, the thresholds will adaptively adjust to reduce the space of\nthe stealthy attack signals. The resilience of the secured filter with\ndetection is verified by an explicit relationship between the upper bound of\nthe estimation error and the number of detected attacked sensors.

However, because of the high upfront cost\nof EVs, most agencies can afford only mixed fleets of internal-combustion and\nelectric vehicles. Making the best use of these mixed fleets presents a\nchallenge for agencies since optimizing the assignment of vehicles to transit\nroutes, scheduling charging, etc. require accurate predictions of electricity\nand fuel use. Recent advances in sensor-based technologies, data analytics, and\nmachine learning enable remedying this situation; however, to the best of our\nknowledge, there exists no framework that would integrate all relevant data\ninto a route-level prediction model for public transit.

Those offloaded tasks\nmay experience large processing delay or even be dropped when their deadlines\nexpire. Due to the uncertain load dynamics at the edge nodes, it is challenging\nfor each device to determine its offloading decision (i.e., whether to offload\nor not, and which edge node it should offload its task to) in a decentralized\nmanner. In this work, we consider non-divisible and delay-sensitive tasks as\nwell as edge load dynamics, and formulate a task offloading problem to minimize\nthe expected long-term cost.

Through the\ndevelopment of devices with low-power radios, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)\ncan be configured for almost any type of application. Agricultural has been one\nexample where IoT and WSN have been able to increase productivity, efficiency,\nand output yield. Systems that previously required manual operation can be\neasily replaced with sensors and actuators to automate the process such as\nirrigation and disease management. Powering these devices is a concern as\nbatteries are often required due to devices being located where electricity is\nnot readily available. In this paper, a comparison is performed between three\nwireless technologies: IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), Long Range Wireless Area Network\n(LoRaWAN), and IEEE 802.11g (WiFi 2.4~GHz) for agricultural monitoring with\nenergy harvesting capabilities. According to experimental results, LoRaWAN is\nthe optimal technology to use in an agricultural monitoring system where power\nconsumption and network lifetime are a priority. The experimental results can\nbe used for the selection of wireless technology for agricultural monitoring\nfollowing application requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2020 03:32:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-07"}

To enhance\nthe users' quality of experience (QoE) given their limited bandwidth, recent\nworks have proposed a viewport adaptive 360-degree video streaming model by\nexploiting the bitrate adaptation in spatial and temporal domains. Under this\nvideo streaming model, in this paper, we consider a scenario with a newly\ngenerated 360-degree video without viewing history from other users. To\nmaximize the user's QoE, we propose an online bitrate selection algorithm,\ncalled OBS360. The proposed online algorithm can adapt to the unknown and\nheterogeneous users' FoVs and downloading capacities. We prove that the\nproposed algorithm achieves sublinear dynamic regret under a convex decision\nset. This suggests that as the number of video segments increases, the\nperformance of the online algorithm approaches the performance of the offline\nalgorithm, where the users' FoVs and downloading capacities are known. We\nperform simulations with real-world dataset to evaluate the performance of the\nproposed algorithm. Results show that compared with several existing methods,\nour proposed algorithm can enhance the users' QoE significantly by improving\nthe viewing bitrate and reducing the inter-segment and intra-segment\ndegradation losses of the users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-07"}

These are related to its 1T distorted octahedral\nstructure, which leads to strong in-plane anisotropy and the presence of active\nsites at its surface, which makes ReS2 interesting for applications such as gas\nsensors and catalysts for H2 production. However, the current fabrication\nmethods for ReS2 use chemical or physical vapor deposition (CVD or PVD)\nprocesses that are costly and involve complex and lengthy fabrication\nprocedures, therefore limiting their large-scale production and exploitation.\nTo address this issue, we developed a colloidal synthesis approach, which\nallows the production of ReS2 to be attained at temperatures below 360 Celsius\ndegrees and with reaction times < 2 h, resulting in a more cost-efficient\nstrategy than the CVD and PVD methods. By combining the solution-based\nsynthesis with surface functionalization strategies, we demonstrate the\nfeasibility of colloidal ReS2 nanosheet films for gas sensing of different\ntoxic gases, moisture and other volatile compounds with highly competitive\nperformance in comparison with devices built with CVD-grown ReS2 and MoS2. In\naddition, the integration of the ReS2 nanosheet films in assemblies, in which\nthey are deposited on top of networks of carbon nanotubes, allowed us to\nfabricate electrodes for electrocatalysis for H2 production in both acid and\nalkaline conditions. Results from proof-of-principle devices show an\nelectrocatalytic overpotential that is competitive with devices based on ReS2\nproduced by CVD, and even with MoS2, WS2 and MoSe2 electrocatalysts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2020 10:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-28"}

Furthermore, in some STEM disciplines, the\nURM students who earn a degree are earning the same grades as the Asian and\nWhite students who dropped the major. This troubling trend may signify lack of\nsufficient support, mentoring, and guidance to ensure excellence of the URM\nstudents who are already severely disadvantaged.
