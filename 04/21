In that framework, subsystems are viewed as abstract devices that\nreceive measurement settings as inputs and produce measurement outcomes as\noutputs. The labeling convention used to describe these inputs and outputs does\nnot affect the physics; and relabelings are easily implemented by rewiring the\ninput and output ports of the devices. However, a more general class of\noperations can be achieved by using correlated preprocessing and postprocessing\nof the inputs and outputs. In contrast to relabelings, some of these operations\nirreversibly lose information about the underlying device. Other operations are\nreversible, but modify the number of cardinality of inputs and/or outputs. In\nthis work, we single out the set of deterministic local maps as the one\nsatisfying two equivalent constructions: an operational definition from\ncausality, and an axiomatic definition reminiscent of the definition of quantum\ncompletely positive trace-preserving maps. We then study the algebraic\nproperties of that set. Surprisingly, the study of these fundamental properties\nhas deep and practical applications. First, the invariant subspaces of these\ntransformations directly decompose the space of correlations/Bell inequalities\ninto nonsignaling, signaling and normalization components. This impacts the\nclassification of Bell and causal inequalities, and the construction of\nassemblages/witnesses in steering scenarios. Second, the left and right\ninvertible deterministic local operations provide an operational generalization\nof the liftings introduced by Pironio [J. Math. Phys., 46(6):062112 (2005)].\nNot only Bell-local, but also causal inequalities can be lifted; liftings also\napply to correlation boxes in a variety of scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 16:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

Most existing personalized product models follow the paradigm of\nrepresenting and matching user intents and items in the semantic space, where\nfiner-grained matching is totally discarded and the ranking of an item cannot\nbe explained further than just user/item level similarity. In addition, while\nsome models in existing studies have created dynamic user representations based\non search context, their representations for items are static across all search\nsessions. This makes every piece of information about the item always equally\nimportant in representing the item during matching with various user intents.\nAware of the above limitations, we propose a review-based transformer model\n(RTM) for personalized product search, which encodes the sequence of query,\nuser reviews, and item reviews with a transformer architecture. RTM conducts\nreview-level matching between the user and item, where each review has a\ndynamic effect according to the context in the sequence. This makes it possible\nto identify useful reviews to explain the scoring. Experimental results show\nthat RTM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art personalized product search\nbaselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 16:29:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 18:16:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 18:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

AT2016dah is an almost text book example of a 'very fast' declining, yet\nuncommon, Fe II'b' (broad-lined) nova, discovered during the rise to peak\noptical luminosity, and decaying with a smooth broken power-law light curve.\nAT2017fyp is classed as a 'fast' nova, unusually for M31, its early decline\nspectrum simultaneously shows properties of both Fe II and He/N spectral types\n- a 'hybrid'. Similarly, the light curve of AT2017fyp has a broken power-law\ndecline but exhibits an extended flat-topped maximum. Both novae were followed\nin the UV and X-ray by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, but no X-ray source\nwas detected for either nova. The pair were followed photometrically and\nspectroscopically into their nebular phases. The progenitor systems were not\nvisible in archival optical data, implying that the mass donors are main\nsequence stars. What makes AT2016dah and AT2017fyp particularly interesting is\ntheir position with respect to M31. The pair are close on the sky but are\nlocated far from the centre of M31, lying almost along the semi-minor axis of\ntheir host. Radial velocity measurements and simulations of the M31 nova\npopulation leads to the conclusion that both novae are members of the Andromeda\nGiant Stellar Stream (GSS). We find the probability of at least two M31 novae\nappearing coincident with the GSS by chance is ~1%. Therefore, we claim that\nthese novae arose from the GSS progenitor, not M31 - the first confirmed novae\ndiscovered in a tidal steam.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 16:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

We show how a\nreduction is to be expected because any two galaxies with the same Mstar have\nat least one radius with identical surface density, where the galaxies have\nidentical size. However, the reason why the scatter is reduced to the observed\nlevel is not trivial, and we pin it down to the galaxy surface density profiles\napproximately following Sersic profiles with their Re and Sersic index (n)\nanti-correlated (i.e., given Mstar, n increases when Re decreases). Our\nanalytical results describe very well the behavior of the observed galaxies as\nportrayed in the NASA Sloan Atlas (NSA), which contains more than half a\nmillion local objects with 7 < log(Mstar/Msun) < 11.5. The comparison with NSA\ngalaxies also allows us to find the optimal values for the mass surface density\n(2.4m0.9p1.3 Msun/pc2) and surface brightness (r-band 24.7pm0.5 mag/arcsec2)\nthat minimize the scatter, although the actual values depend somehow on the\nsubset of NSA galaxies used for optimization. The physical reason for the\nexistence of optimal values is unknown but, as Trujillo+20 point out, they are\nclose to the gas surface density threshold to form stars and thus may trace the\nphysical end of a galaxy. Our NSA-based size--mass relation agrees with theirs\non the slope as well as on the magnitude of the scatter. As a by-product of the\nnarrowness of the size--mass relation (only 0.06 dex), we propose to use the\nsize of a galaxy to measure its stellar mass.

A key physical effect that can\ndistinguish among formation scenarios is the misalignment of the spins with the\norbital angular momentum, causing the spins and the binary's orbital plane to\nprecess. To accurately model such systems, it is crucial to include multipoles\nbeyond the dominant quadrupole. Here, we develop the first multipolar\nprecessing waveform model in the effective-one-body (EOB) formalism for the\ninspiral, merger and ringdown (IMR) of binary black holes: SEOBNRv4PHM. In the\nnonprecessing limit, the model reduces to SEOBNRv4HM, which was calibrated to\nnumerical-relativity (NR) simulations, and waveforms from perturbation theory.\nWe validate SEOBNRv4PHM by comparing it to the public catalog of 1405\nprecessing NR waveforms of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS)\ncollaboration, and also to new 118 precessing NR waveforms, which span mass\nratios 1-4 and spins up to 0.9.

However, these security standards rely on\nmandatory immunity assumptions such as the integrity and authenticity of an\ninitial system configuration typically loaded from Non-Volatile Memory (NVM).\nThis applies especially to FPGA-based Programmable System-on-Chip (PSoC)\narchitectures, since object codes as well as configuration data easily exceed\nthe capacity of a secure bootROM. In this context, an attacker could try to\nalter the content of the NVM device in order to manipulate the system. The PSoC\ntherefore relies on the integrity of the NVM particularly at boot-time. In this\npaper, we propose a methodology for securely booting from an NVM in a\npotentially unsecure environment by exploiting the reconfigurable logic of the\nFPGA. Here, the FPGA serves as a secure anchor point by performing required\nintegrity and authenticity verifications prior to the configuration and\nexecution of any user application loaded from the NVM on the PSoC. The proposed\nsecure boot process is based on the following assumptions and steps: 1) The\nboot configurationis stored on a fully encrypted Secure Digital memory card (SD\ncard) or alternatively Flash acting as NVM. 2) At boot time, a hardware design\ncalled Trusted Memory-Interface Unit (TMIU) is loaded to verify first the\nauthenticity of the deployed NVM and then after decryption the integrity of its\ncontent. To demonstrate the practicability of our approach, we integrated the\nmethodology into the vendor-specific secure boot process of a Xilinx Zynq PSoC\nand evaluated the design objectives performance, power and resource costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 17:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

The numerically computed optimal control strategy is a\nsingle-intervention scenario that goes beyond heuristically motivated\ninterventions and simple \"flattening of the curve.\" Careful analysis of the\ncomputed control strategy reveals, however, that the obtained solution is in\nfact a tightrope walk close to the stability boundary of the system, where\nsocio-economic costs and the risk of a new outbreak must be constantly balanced\nagainst one another. The model system is calibrated to reproduce the initial\nexponential growth phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 17:47:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 17:55:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 00:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

We adopt catalogs of CB mergers derived from recent $N-$body and\npopulation-synthesis simulations, to describe the MRD of CBs formed in young\nstar clusters (hereafter, dynamical CBs) and in the field (hereafter, isolated\nCBs). The local MRD of dynamical BBHs is $\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm BBH}=64^{+34}_{-20}$\nGpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with the 90% credible interval from the first\nand second observing run (O1 and O2) of the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, and with\nthe local MRD of isolated BBHs ($\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm BBH}=50^{+71}_{-37}$\nGpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$). The local MRD of dynamical and isolated black hole -\nneutron star binaries is $\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm BHNS}=41^{+33}_{-23}$ and\n$49^{+48}_{-34}$~Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. Both values are consistent\nwith the upper limit inferred from O1 and O2. Finally, the local MRD of\ndynamical binary neutron stars (BNSs, $\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm BNS}=151^{+59}_{-38}$\nGpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$) is a factor of two lower than the local MRD of isolated\nBNSs ($\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm BNS}=283^{+97}_{-75}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$). The MRD\nfor all CB classes grows with redshift, reaching its maximum at $z \\in\n[1.5,2.5]$, and then decreases. This trend springs from the interplay between\ncosmic star formation rate, metallicity evolution and delay time of binary\ncompact objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 18:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 11:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

We characterize their gas-phase metal abundances and spatially\nresolved, ionized gas kinematics, and demonstrate that the gas-phase\nmetallicity in NGC 4418 significantly exceeds that in VV 655. No kinematic\ndisturbances in the ionized gas are observed along the minor axis of NGC 4418,\nbut we see evidence for ionized gas outflows from VV 655 that may increase the\ncross-section for gas stripping in grazing collisions. A faint, asymmetric\nouter arm is detected in NGC 4418 of the type normally associated with\ngalaxy-galaxy interactions. The simplest model suggests that the minor\ninteraction between VV 655 and NGC 4418 produced the unusual nuclear properties\nof the LIRG via tidal torquing of the interstellar medium of NGC 4418 rather\nthan through a significant gas transfer event. In addition to inducing a\ncentral concentration of gas in NGC 4418, this interaction also produced an\nenhanced star formation rate and an outer tidal arm in the LIRG.

The formation mechanism of these systems is still a\nmuch debated question, and so are their kinematical properties. In this work,\nwe address this topic by analyzing the stellar kinematics of isolated UDGs\nformed in the hydrodynamical simulation suite NIHAO. We construct projected\nline-of-sight velocity and velocity dispersion maps to compute the projected\nspecific angular momentum, $\\lambda_{\\rm R}$, to characterize the kinematical\nsupport of the stars in these galaxies. We found that UDGs cover a broad\ndistribution, ranging from dispersion to rotation supported galaxies, with\nsimilar abundances in both regimes. The degree of rotation support of simulated\nUDGs correlates with several properties such as galaxy morphology, higher HI\nfractions and larger effective radii with respect to the dispersion supported\ngroup, while the dark matter halo spin and mass accretion history are similar\namongst the two populations. We demonstrate that the alignment of the infalling\nbaryons into the protogalaxy at early $z$ is the principal driver of the $z$=0\nstellar kinematic state: pressure supported isolated UDGs form via mis-aligned\ngas accretion while rotation supported ones build-up their baryons in an\nordered manner. Accounting for random inclination effects, we predict that a\ncomprehensive survey will find nearly half of field UDGs to have rotationally\nsupported stellar disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 18:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 11:20:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

To this end, we first propose a sparse points based\nintra-scale cost aggregation method to alleviate the well-known edge-fattening\nissue at disparity discontinuities. Further, we approximate traditional\ncross-scale cost aggregation algorithm with neural network layers to handle\nlarge textureless regions. Both modules are simple, lightweight, and\ncomplementary, leading to an effective and efficient architecture for cost\naggregation. With these two modules, we can not only significantly speed up\nexisting top-performing models (e.g., $41\\times$ than GC-Net, $4\\times$ than\nPSMNet and $38\\times$ than GA-Net), but also improve the performance of fast\nstereo models (e.g., StereoNet). We also achieve competitive results on Scene\nFlow and KITTI datasets while running at 62ms, demonstrating the versatility\nand high efficiency of the proposed method.

We find that, surprisingly, EPTs are possible even in the absence\nof scrambling unitary dynamics, where they are best understood as arising from\nmeasurements alone. This motivates us to introduce \\emph{measurement-only\nmodels}, in which the \"scrambling\" and \"un-scrambling\" effects driving the EPT\nare fundamentally intertwined and cannot be attributed to physically distinct\nprocesses. This represents a novel form of an EPT, conceptually distinct from\nthat in hybrid unitary-projective circuits.

We consider colloids adjacent to the interface or adhered to the\ninterface with a pinned contact line. The Reynolds and capillary numbers are\nassumed much less than unity, in line with typical micron-scale colloids\ninvolving air- or alkane-aqueous interfaces. For driven colloids, the\nleading-order flow is given by the point-force (and/or torque) response of this\nsystem. For active colloids, the force-dipole (stresslet) response occurs at\nleading order. At clean (surfactant-free) interfaces, these hydrodynamic modes\nare essentially a restricted set of the usual Stokes multipoles in a bulk\nfluid. To leading order, driven colloids exert Stokeslets parallel to the\ninterface, while active colloids drive differently oriented stresslets\ndepending on the colloid's orientation. We then consider how these modes are\naltered by the presence of an incompressible interface, a typical circumstance\nfor colloidal systems at small capillary numbers in the presence of surfactant.\nThe leading-order modes for driven and active colloids are restructured\ndramatically.

A Lagrangian approach to the thermodynamic\npotential of quark-meson-nucleon (QMN) matter was used. In this approach,\ndynamical chiral-symmetry breaking is described by the scalar mean-field\ndynamics coupled to quarks and nucleons and their chiral partners, whereby its\nrestoration occurs in the hadronic phase by parity doubling, as well as in the\nquark phase. Quark confinement was achieved by an auxiliary scalar field that\nparametrizes a dynamical infrared cutoff in the quark sector, serving as an\nultraviolet cutoff for the nucleonic phase space. The gap equations were solved\nfor the isospin-symmetric case, as well as for neutron star (NS) conditions. We\nalso calculated the mass-radius (MR) relation of NSs and their tidal\ndeformability parameter. The obtained EoS is in accordance with nuclear matter\nproperties at saturation density and with the flow constraint from heavy ion\ncollision experiments. For isospin-asymmetric matter, a sequential occurrence\nof light quark flavors is obtained, allowing for a mixed phase of\nchirally-symmetric nucleonic matter with deconfined down quarks.

Naively using signed quantization to\naccommodate these negative values requires an extra sign bit which is expensive\nfor low-bit (2-, 3-, 4-bit) quantization. To solve this problem, we propose\nLSQ+, a natural extension of LSQ, wherein we introduce a general asymmetric\nquantization scheme with trainable scale and offset parameters that can learn\nto accommodate the negative activations.

Our results show that Tor currently\nunderestimates its true capacity by about 50% and improperly balances its\ntraffic by 15-25%. Then, to solve the problems with security and accuracy, we\npresent FlashFlow, a system to measure the capacity of Tor relays. Our analysis\nshows that FlashFlow limits a malicious relay to obtaining a capacity estimate\nat most 1.33 times its true capacity. Through realistic Internet experiments,\nwe find that FlashFlow measures relay capacity with at least 89% accuracy 95%\nof the time. Through simulation, we find that FlashFlow can measure the entire\nTor network in less than 5 hours using 3 measurers with 1 Gbit/s of bandwidth\neach. Finally, simulations using FlashFlow for load balancing shows that,\ncompared to TorFlow, network weight error decreases by 86%, while the median of\n50 KiB, 1 MiB, and 5 MiB transfer times decreases by 15%, 29%, and 37%,\nrespectively.

An important data-driven state-of-the-art method use\nthe Koopman operator to generate a linear evolution model for a vector-valued\nobservable of original state-space. As a result, one can derive a sampling\nstrategy via the linear evolution property of observable.

This study was designed to characterize a\nburn mouse model with tissue-specific insulin resistance under insulin clamp\nconditions. C57BL6/J mice were subjected to 30% full-thickness burn injury and\nunderwent the combination of hyperinsulinemic isoglycemicclamp (HIC) and\npositron emission tomography (PET).

In this setting, a single supplier allocates\ncapacity-limited resources to requests that arrive in a sequential and\narbitrary manner. Each request is associated with an agent who may act\nselfishly to misreport the requirement and valuation of her request. The\nsupplier charges payment from agents whose requests are satisfied, but incurs a\nload-dependent supply cost. The goal is to design an incentive compatible\nonline mechanism, which determines not only the resource allocation of each\nrequest, but also the payment of each agent, so as to (approximately) maximize\nthe social welfare (i.e., aggregate valuations minus supply cost). We study\nthis problem under the framework of competitive analysis. The major\ncontribution of this paper is the development of a unified approach that\nachieves the best-possible competitive ratios for setups with different supply\ncosts. Specifically, we show that when there is no supply cost or the supply\ncost function is linear, our model is essentially a standard 0-1 knapsack\nproblem, for which our approach achieves logarithmic competitive ratios that\nmatch the state-of-the-art (which is optimal). For the more challenging setup\nwhen the supply cost is strictly-convex, we provide online mechanisms, for the\nfirst time, that lead to the optimal competitive ratios as well. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first approach that unifies the characterization of\noptimal competitive ratios in online resource allocation for different setups\nincluding zero, linear and strictly-convex supply costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 21:18:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 03:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

They fear that the rapid influx of patients will overwhelm\nthe healthcare system leading to unnecessary fatalities. Most countries and\nstates in America have introduced mitigation strategies, such as social\ndistancing, to decrease the rate of newly infected people, i.e. flattening the\ncurve.In this paper, we analyze the time evolution of the number of people\nhospitalized due to the coronavirus using the methods of queueing theory.

We also demonstrate how flattening the curve\nimpacts the elapsed time between the peak rate of hospitalizations and the time\nof the peak demand for the hospital resources.

Therefore, the general memory access pattern of an\naccelerator can largely be determined for a given application. Exploiting these\ncharacteristics, MGX generates version numbers used in memory encryption and\nintegrity verification using on-chip accelerator state rather than storing them\nin the off-chip memory; it also customizes the granularity of the memory\nprotection to match the granularity used by the accelerator. To demonstrate the\nefficacy of MGX, we present an in-depth study of MGX for DNN and graph\nalgorithms.

Previous approaches mainly\nrely on probabilistic models or predefined rules for modeling co-occurrence\nrelationships among AUs, leading to limited generalization. In contrast, we\npresent a new learning framework that automatically learns the latent\nrelationships of AUs via establishing semantic correspondences between feature\nmaps. In the heatmap regression-based network, feature maps preserve rich\nsemantic information associated with AU intensities and locations. Moreover,\nthe AU co-occurring pattern can be reflected by activating a set of feature\nchannels, where each channel encodes a specific visual pattern of AU. This\nmotivates us to model the correlation among feature channels, which implicitly\nrepresents the co-occurrence relationship of AU intensity levels. Specifically,\nwe introduce a semantic correspondence convolution (SCC) module to dynamically\ncompute the correspondences from deep and low resolution feature maps, and thus\nenhancing the discriminability of features. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and the superior performance of our method on two\nbenchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 23:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

However, identifying skin lesions involves a variety of aspects in\nterms of size, color, shape, and texture. To make matters worse, many\ncategories only contain very few samples, posing great challenges to\nconventional machine learning algorithms and even human experts. Inspired by\nthe recent success of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) in natural image classification,\nwe propose to apply FSL to skin disease identification to address the extreme\nscarcity of training sample problem. However, directly applying FSL to this\ntask does not work well in practice, and we find that the problem can be\nlargely attributed to the incompatibility between Cross Entropy (CE) and\nepisode training, which are both commonly used in FSL. Based on a detailed\nanalysis, we propose the Query-Relative (QR) loss, which proves superior to CE\nunder episode training and is closely related to recently proposed mutual\ninformation estimation. Moreover, we further strengthen the proposed QR loss\nwith a novel adaptive hard margin strategy.

The hub model assumes that each\nmember of the group is brought together by a member of the group called the\nhub. The hub model belongs to the family of Bernoulli mixture models.\nIdentifiability of parameters is a notoriously difficult problem for Bernoulli\nmixture models. This paper proves identifiability of the hub model parameters\nand estimation consistency under mild conditions. Furthermore, this paper\ngeneralizes the hub model by introducing a model component that allows hubless\ngroups in which individual nodes spontaneously appear independent of any other\nindividual. We refer to this additional component as the null component. The\nnew model bridges the gap between the hub model and the degenerate case of the\nmixture model -- the Bernoulli product.

As a possible solution, we\nconsider the scenario where high-metallicity GRB hosts harbour low metallicity\nregions in which GRB progenitors form. For this, we use the IllustrisTNG\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulation to investigate the internal metallicity\ndistribution of GRB hosts, implementing in post-processing different GRB\nformation models.

Unfortunately, the costs of acquiring densely\nsampled data rapidly become prohibitive and we need to look for ways to\nsparsely collect data, e.g. from sparsely distributed ocean bottom nodes, from\nwhich we then derive densely sampled surveys through the method of wavefield\nreconstruction. Because of their relatively cheap and simple calculations,\nwavefield reconstruction via matrix factorizations has proven to be a viable\nand scalable alternative to the more generally used transform-based methods.\nWhile this method is capable of processing all full azimuth data frequency by\nfrequency slice, its performance degrades at higher frequencies because\nmonochromatic data at these frequencies is not as well approximated by low-rank\nfactorizations. We address this problem by proposing a recursive recovery\ntechnique, which involves weighted matrix factorizations where recovered\nwavefields at the lower frequencies serve as prior information for the recovery\nof the higher frequencies. To limit the adverse effects of potential\noverfitting, we propose a limited-subspace recursively weighted matrix\nfactorization approach where the size of the row and column subspaces to\nconstruct the weight matrices is constrained. We apply our method to data\ncollected from the Gulf of Suez, and our results show that our limited-subspace\nweighted recovery method significantly improves the recovery quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 04:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Our evaluation sheds light on questions, such as\nhow user attributes are being used for political ads targeting and which users\nare more prone to be targeted with political ads.

The basic idea of SI is to\nmake inference conditional on the selection event. Unfortunately, the main\nlimitation of the original SI approach for Lasso is that the inference is\nconducted not only conditional on the selected features but also on their signs\n-- this leads to loss of power because of over-conditioning. Although this\nlimitation can be circumvented by considering the union of such selection\nevents for all possible combinations of signs, this is only feasible when the\nnumber of selected features is sufficiently small. To address this\ncomputational bottleneck, we propose a parametric programming-based method that\ncan conduct SI without conditioning on signs even when we have thousands of\nactive features. The main idea is to compute the continuum path of Lasso\nsolutions in the direction of a test statistic, and identify the subset of the\ndata space corresponding to the feature selection event by following the\nsolution path. The proposed parametric programming-based method not only avoids\nthe aforementioned computational bottleneck but also improves the performance\nand practicality of SI for Lasso in various respects.

This controller is trained\nfirst using the data provided from a previous adaptive control strategy.

The younger generations today spend considerably more time\non mobile phones and games. However, there are very few applications or games\naimed to help in practicing safety measures against a pandemic, which is much\nlesser in the case of Covid-19. Hence, we propose a 2D survival-based game,\nSurviveCovid-19, aimed to educate people about safety precautions to be taken\nfor Covid-19 outside their homes by incorporating social distancing and usage\nof masks and sanitizers in the game. SurviveCovid-19 has been designed as an\nAndroid-based mobile game, along with a desktop (browser) version, and has been\nevaluated through a remote quantitative user survey, with 30 volunteers using\nthe questionnaire based on the MEEGA+ model. The survey results are promising,\nwith all the survey questions having a mean value greater than 3.5. The game's\nquality factor was 69.3, indicating that the game could be classified as\nexcellent quality, according to the MEEGA+ model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 05:24:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 17:47:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

In reality however, no physical\nprocess can occur over a truly infinitesimal time interval. A more subtle\ninvestigation of open quantum systems lead to the theory of continuous\nmeasurement and quantum trajectories, in which wave function collapse occurs\nover a finite time scale associated with an interaction. Within this formalism,\nit becomes possible to ask many new questions that would be trivial or even\nill-defined in the context of the more basic measurement model. In this thesis,\nwe investigate both theoretically and experimentally what fundamentally new\ncapabilities arise when an experimental apparatus can resolve the continuous\ndynamics of a measurement. Theoretically, we show that when one can perform\nfeedback operations on the timescale of the measurement process, the resulting\ntools provide significantly more control over entanglement generation, and in\nsome settings can generate it optimally. We derive these results using a novel\nformalism which encompasses most known quantum feedback protocols.\nExperimentally, we show that continuous measurement allows one to observe the\ndynamics of a system undergoing simultaneous non-commuting measurements, which\nprovides a reinterpretation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Finally,\nwe combine the theoretical focus on quantum feedback with the experimental\ncapabilities of superconducting circuits to implement a feedback controlled\nquantum amplifier. The resulting system is capable of adaptive measurement,\nwhich we use to perform the first canonical phase measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 06:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

These auxiliary loss functions\nfacilitate better discrimination between the different classes of interest.\nHowever, recent studies hint at the fact that these loss functions do not take\ninto account the intrinsic angular distribution exhibited by the low-level and\nhigh-level feature representations. This results in less compactness between\nsamples from the same class and unclear boundary separations between data\nclusters of different classes. In this paper, we address this issue by\nproposing the use of geometric constraints, rooted in Riemannian geometry.\nSpecifically, we propose Angular Margin Contrastive Loss (AMC-Loss), a new loss\nfunction to be used along with the traditional cross-entropy loss. The AMC-Loss\nemploys the discriminative angular distance metric that is equivalent to\ngeodesic distance on a hypersphere manifold such that it can serve a clear\ngeometric interpretation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AMC-Loss by\nproviding quantitative and qualitative results.

One such qualitative\nstudy suggests the 9-Factor Theory of Scrum Master roles, which claims that the\nScrum Master performs a set of 9 leadership roles which are transferred to the\nteam over time (Spiegler et al., 2019). We aimed at conducting a quantitative\nexploration that examines the presence and change of the 9-Factory Theory in\nrelation to team maturity. We conducted an online survey with 67 individuals at\nthe conglomerate Robert Bosch GmbH. Descriptive statistics reveal that the\nScrum Master and the agile team score differently on the 9 factors and that the\nScrum Master role is most often distributed in teams that had been working\nbetween 3 and 5 months in an agile manner. Yet, we also find that the\nleadership roles predominantly remain with one dedicated Scrum Master. Based on\nour results we suggest to group the 9-Factor Theory into three clusters: the\nScrum Master is rather linked to psychological team factors (1), while the team\ntends to be linked to rather product-related factors (2). Organizational\nfactors (3) are less often present. Our practical implications suggest an\nextension of the Scrum Master description. Furthermore, our study lays\ngroundwork for future quantitative testing of leadership in agile teams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 08:55:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-15"}

While\nthis drawback has been the object of numerous solution attempts in the standard\nlow-frequency breakdown regime for scattering problems, the eddy-current regime\nrequires a specific treatment. In this contribution, we present an extension of\nthe recently introduced quasi-Helmholtz projectors based preconditioning of the\nPMCHWT to obtain an equation stable at low frequencies and specifically in\nthree regimes relevant for eddy currents analyses: (i) when the frequency\ndecreases with a constant conductivity, (ii) when the conductivity increases at\nfixed frequency and (iii) when the frequency decreases while keeping the\nproduct of the frequency and the conductivity constant. Being based on\nquasi-Helmholtz projectors our new strategy does not further degrade the\nconditioning of the original equation and is compatible with existing fast\nsolvers. The resulting full-wave formulation is capable of smoothly\ntransitioning from simulations at high frequencies to the different\nlow-frequency regimes which encompass, in particular, eddy currents\napplications. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of our approach in all\nthe regimes with a special emphasis given to eddy currents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 09:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

These dressed states are then used as the two lower states of a\n{\\Lambda}-type three-level scheme using two infrared lasers to couple them to\nanother ro-vibrational level in the ground-state manifold. One of the infrared\nlasers is used as a weak probe and the other as a control field with a fixed\ndetuning.

Diagnosis is commonly performed with\nmagnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Survival biomarkers are\nchallenging to identify due to the relatively low numbers of individual tumour\ntypes, especially for rare tumour types such as atypical rhabdoid tumours.\n  Methods 69 children with biopsy-confirmed brain tumours were recruited into\nthis study. All participants had both perfusion and diffusion weighted imaging\nperformed at diagnosis. Data were processed using conventional methods, and a\nBayesian survival analysis performed. Unsupervised and supervised machine\nlearning were performed with the survival features, to determine novel\nsub-groups related to survival. Sub-group analysis was undertaken to understand\ndifferences in imaging features, which pertain to survival.\n  Findings Survival analysis showed that a combination of diffusion and\nperfusion imaging were able to determine two novel sub-groups of brain tumours\nwith different survival characteristics (p <0.01), which were subsequently\nclassified with high accuracy (98%) by a neural network. Further analysis of\nhigh-grade tumours showed a marked difference in survival (p=0.029) between the\ntwo clusters with high risk and low risk imaging features.\n  Interpretation This study has developed a novel model of survival for\npaediatric brain tumours, with an implementation ready for integration into\nclinical practice. Results show that tumour perfusion plays a key role in\ndetermining survival in brain tumours and should be considered as a high\npriority for future imaging protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 09:24:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

While its optimization version, known as the minimum vertex deletion\nproblem in literature, has been intensively studied, enumeration algorithms are\nknown for a few simple graph classes, e.g., independent sets, cliques, and\nforests, until very recently [Conte and Uno, STOC 2019]. There is also a\nconnected variation of this problem, where one is concerned with only those\ninduced subgraphs that are connected. We introduce two new approaches, which\nenable us to develop algorithms that solve both variations for a number of\nimportant graph classes. A general technique that has been proved very powerful\nin enumeration algorithms is to build a solution map, i.e., a multiple digraph\non all the solutions of the problem, and the key of this approach is to make\nthe solution map strongly connected, so that a simple traversal of the solution\nmap solves the problem. We introduce retaliation-free paths to certificate\nstrong connectedness of the solution map we build. Generalizing the idea of\nCohen, Kimelfeld, and Sagiv [JCSS 2008], we introduce the $t$-restricted\nversion, $t$ being a positive integer, of the maximal (connected) induced\nsubgraphs problem, and show that it is equivalent to the original problem in\nterms of solvability in incremental polynomial time. Moreover, we give\nreductions between the two variations, so that it suffices to solve one of the\nvariations for each class we study. Our work also leads to direct and simpler\nproofs of several important known results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 10:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

The inverse distribution function is one such transformation. The\ndiscrepancy is a measure of how well the empirical distribution of any design\nmatches its target distribution. This chapter addresses the question of whether\na variable transformation of a low discrepancy uniform design yields a low\ndiscrepancy design for the desired target distribution. The answer depends on\nthe two kernel functions used to define the respective discrepancies. If these\nkernels satisfy certain conditions, then the answer is yes. However, these\nconditions may be undesirable for practical reasons. In such a case, the\ntransformation of a low discrepancy uniform design may yield a design with a\nlarge discrepancy. We illustrate how this may occur. We also suggest some\nremedies. One remedy is to ensure that the original uniform design has optimal\none-dimensional projection, but this remedy works best if the design is dense,\nor in other words, the ratio of sample size divided by the dimension of the\nrandom variable is relatively large. Another remedy is to use the transformed\ndesign as the input to a coordinate-exchange algorithm that optimizes the\ndesired discrepancy, and this works for both dense or sparse designs. The\neffectiveness of these two remedies is illustrated via simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 10:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

Current emotion recognition research mainly focuses on single modality\n(e.g., facial expression), while human emotion expressions are multi-modal in\nnature. In this paper, we propose a hybrid emotion recognition system\nleveraging two emotion-rich and tightly-coupled modalities, i.e., facial\nexpression and body gesture. However, unbiased and fine-grained facial\nexpression and gesture recognition remain a major problem. To this end, unlike\nour rivals relying on contact or even invasive sensors, we explore the\ncommodity WiFi signal for device-free and contactless gesture recognition,\nwhile adopting a vision-based facial expression. However, there exist two\ndesign challenges, i.e., how to improve the sensitivity of WiFi signals and how\nto process the large-volume, heterogeneous, and non-synchronous data\ncontributed by the two-modalities. For the former, we propose a signal\nsensitivity enhancement method based on the Rician K factor theory; for the\nlatter, we combine CNN and RNN to mine the high-level features of bi-modal\ndata, and perform a score-level fusion for fine-grained recognition.

In this work, we elaborate a quantum mechanical\ndescription of the MIM cavity as a double barrier quantum well.

The quantum treatment allows to describe the tunnel effect for\nphotons, and reveals that the MIM cavity resonances can be excited by resonant\ntunneling via illumination through the metal, without the need of momentum\nmatching techniques such as prisms or grating couplers. By combining this\nanalysis with spectroscopic ellipsometry on experimental MIM structures, and by\ndeveloping a simple harmonic oscillator model of the MIM for the calculation of\nits effective permittivity, we show that the cavity eigenmodes coincide with\nlow-loss zeros of the effective permittivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 11:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

The distribution of magnetic\nfield gradients parallel to the field, affecting the electron heating\nefficiency, cover a range from 0 to 13 T/m, being similar to conventional\nECRIS. Therefore it is expected that the novel ion source produces warm\nelectrons and high charge state ions in significant number. Single electron\ntracking simulations are used to estimate plasma flux distribution on the\nplasma chamber walls and to provide an estimate of the ion density profile at\nthe extraction slit then used in ion optical simulations demonstrating high\ntransmission through the low energy beam transport. The designed ion source is\nintended to study if the quadrupole field topology could produce high charge\nstate beams in comparable intensities to conventional ECRIS and efficiently\ntransport them through a low energy beamline, thus paving the way for a\nsuperconducting ARC-ECRIS using the same field topology. Furthermore, the\nprospects of the presented ion source design as an injector of a single-ended\naccelerator for ion beam analysis are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 11:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

In conventional computers, data copy is often carried out by\ntwo separate read and write transactions that pass data back and forth between\nthe DRAM chip and the processor chip. Some prior mechanisms propose to avoid\nthis unnecessary data movement by using the shared internal bus in the DRAM\nchip to directly copy data within the DRAM chip (e.g., between two DRAM banks).\nWhile these methods exhibit superior performance compared to conventional\ntechniques, data copy across different DRAM banks is still greatly slower than\ndata copy within the same DRAM bank. Hence, these techniques have limited\nbenefit for the emerging 3D-stacked memories (e.g., HMC and HBM) that contain\nhundreds of DRAM banks across multiple memory controllers. In this paper, we\npresent Network-on-Memory (NoM), a lightweight inter-bank data communication\nscheme that enables direct data copy across both memory banks of a 3D-stacked\nmemory. NoM adopts a TDM-based circuit-switching design, where circuit setup is\ndone by the memory controller.

Key to their functioning is efficient energy\ntransfer (ET) from the NC to the triplet state of the ligands that sensitizes\nthe triplet state of free emitters, whose annihilation generates the\nupconverted emission. To date, the triplet sensitization efficiency in such\nsystems is limited by parasitic processes, such as charge transfer (typically\nof the photohole) to the organic ligand due to the disadvantageous band\nalignment of typical NCs and organic moieties. Available strategies only\npartially mitigate such losses and intrinsically limit the ET yield. Here we\ndemonstrate a new exciton-manipulation approach that enables loss-free ET\nwithout detrimental side-effects. Specifically, we use CdSe NCs doped with gold\natoms featuring a hole-accepting state in the NC bandgap at a higher energy\nthan the HOMO level of the ligand 9-anthracene acid. Upon photoexcitation, the\nNC photoholes are routed to the Au-state faster than their transfer to the\nligand, producing a long-lived bound exciton in perfect resonance with its\ntriplet state. This hinders hole-transfer losses and results in ~100% efficient\nET, over 50-fold higher than in standard NCs. By combining our hybrid\nsensitizers with an annihilator moiety, we achieved an sTTA-UC efficiency of\n~12% (~24% in the normalized definition), which is the highest value for hybrid\nupconverters based on sTTA reported to date and approaches optimized organic\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 12:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Regression adjustment such as the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) is\noften used to account for imbalance and increase precision of the treatment\neffect estimate. An objective alternative is through inverse probability\nweighting (IPW) of the propensity scores. Although IPW and ANCOVA are\nasymptotically equivalent, the former may demonstrate inferior performance in\nfinite samples. In this article, we point out that IPW is a special case of the\ngeneral class of balancing weights, and advocate to use overlap weighting (OW)\nfor covariate adjustment. The OW method has a unique advantage of completely\nremoving chance imbalance when the propensity score is estimated by logistic\nregression. We show that the OW estimator attains the same semiparametric\nvariance lower bound as the most efficient ANCOVA estimator and the IPW\nestimator for a continuous outcome, and derive closed-form variance estimators\nfor OW when estimating additive and ratio estimands. Through extensive\nsimulations, we demonstrate OW consistently outperforms IPW in finite samples\nand improves the efficiency over ANCOVA and augmented IPW when the degree of\ntreatment effect heterogeneity is moderate or when the outcome model is\nincorrectly specified. We apply the proposed OW estimator to the Best Apnea\nInterventions for Research (BestAIR) randomized trial to evaluate the effect of\ncontinuous positive airway pressure on patient health outcomes.

Dust particles leaving the planet\nperform a characteristic U-turn relative to it, producing an azimuthally\nelongated blob-like emission feature.

On the other hand, we construct the same models in the standard\ndark matter model and compare their dynamics with the galactic models in\nmodified gravity. It turns out that there are serious differences between\ngalactic models in these different viewpoints. For example, we explicitly show\nthat the galactic models in modified gravity, host faster bars compared to the\ndark matter case. On the other hand, final stellar bars are weaker in modified\ngravity. These facts are not new and have already been reported in our previous\nsimulations for exponential galactic models.

To do so, we employ different profiles for the disk and halo\nand show that the results remain qualitatively independent of the initial\ngalactic models.

As an example $S_E^{uu}(\\textbf{k|p,q})$ denotes\nthe kinetic energy transfer rate to the mode $\\textbf{k}$, from the two other\nmodes in the triad, $\\textbf{p}$ and $\\textbf{q}$. As noted by Kraichnan\n(1958), in $S_E^{uu}(\\textbf{k|p,q})$, what fraction of the energy transferred\nto the mode $\\textbf{k}$ originated from $\\textbf{p}$ and which from\n$\\textbf{q}$ is unknown . Such an expression is thus incongruent with the\ncustomary description of turbulence in terms of two-scale energy exchange.\nNotwithstanding this issue, Dar etal. (2001) further decomposed these transfers\ninto separate contributions from $\\textbf{p}$-to-$\\textbf{k}$ and\n$\\textbf{q}$-to-$\\textbf{k}$, thus introducing the concept of mode-to-mode\ntransfers that they applied to MHD turbulence. Doing so, they had to set aside\nadditional transfers circulating within each triad, but failed to calculate\nthem.\n  In the present paper we explain how to derive the complete expressions of the\nmode-to-mode transfers, including the circulating transfers. We do it for\nkinetic energy and kinetic helicity in hydrodynamic turbulence, for kinetic\nenergy, magnetic energy and magnetic helicity in MHD turbulence. Separating the\ncontribution of magnetic advection from magnetic stretching, the energy\nmode-to-mode transfer rates involving the magnetic field become uniquely\ndefined, in striking contrast to the hydrodynamic case. The magnetic helicity\nmode-to-mode transfer rate is also found to be uniquely defined, contrary to\nkinetic helicity in hydrodynamics. We find that shell-to-shell transfer rates\nhave the same properties as mode-to-mode transfer rates. Finally calculating\nthe fluxes, we show how the circulating transfers cancel in accordance with\nconservation laws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 15:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Traditionally,\nQ-Learning based approaches rely on the estimation of conditional mean outcome\ngiven treatment and covariates. However, they are subject to misspecification\nof the main effect model. Recently, simple and flexible one-step methods to\ndirectly learn (D-Learning) the CATE without model specifications have been\nproposed. However, these methods are not robust against misspecification of the\npropensity score model.

The best performing 4D\narchitecture achieves an correlation coefficient (aCC) of 98.58% compared to\n85.0% of a previous 3D deep learning method. Also, our temporal regularization\nstrategy at the output further improves 4D model performance to an aCC of\n99.06%.

We propose 4D spatio-temporal deep learning for OCT-based motion\nestimation. On a tissue dataset, we find that using 4D information for the\nmodel input improves performance while maintaining reasonable inference times.\nOur regularization strategy demonstrates that additional temporal information\nis also beneficial at the model output.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 15:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

When a network slice instance (NSI) is created across the\naccess and core networks, it is important to understand how the communication\nservice from the created slice instance will be distributed to different\ntenants and their end-users. In this vein, we propose a network slice\ncommunication service distribution technique for local 5G micro-operator\ndeployment scenarios.

The aim of this research is\nto extend this investigation to real surgeries that use non-expert crowd\nevaluations. We address two questions (1) whether crowds award more favorable\nratings to videos shown at increased playback speeds, and (2) if crowd\nevaluations of the first minute of a surgical procedure differ from crowd\nevaluations of the entire performance. Methods: A set of 56 videos of\npracticing surgeons were used to evaluate the technical skill of the surgeons\nat each video playback speed used for the first minute of the previously rated\nperformance, using the GEARS assessment criteria. Results: Crowds on average\ndid rate videos higher as playback speed was increased. This effect was\nobserved for both proficient and expert surgeons. Each increase in the playback\nspeed by 0.8x was associated with, on average, a 0.16-point increase in the\nGEARS score for expert surgeons and a 0.27-point increase in GEARS score for\nproficient surgeons, with both groups being perceived as obtaining relatively\nequal skill at the fastest playback speed. It was also found that 22 out of the\n56 surgeons were perceived to be significantly different in skill when just\nviewing the first minute of performance. Conclusion: The observed increase in\nskill ratings with video playback speed replicates findings for laparoscopy in\n[2], and extends to real robotic surgeries. Furthermore, the large differences\nin skill labels when comparing the first minute of surgery to the entire 15\nminute video warrants further investigation into how much perceived skill\nratings vary in time (sub-task level) vs. summative metrics (task level).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 20:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-23"}

However,\nsolar PV panels are connected to the grid through inverters, which can provide\nreactive power support and may mitigate some of these negative effects. In this\npaper, we utilize a three-phase AC optimal power flow (OPF) formulation to\nminimize voltage unbalance using reactive power from solar PV inverters. When\nconsidering actions to reduce voltage unbalance, it is important to recognize\nthat various organizations such as IEC, NEMA and IEEE provide different and\npartially inconsistent definitions of voltage unbalance in their power quality\nstandards.

Three CFI crossing\nalternatives were tested, namely Traditional, Offset, and Midblock crossings.\nIn total, 12 alternative scenarios were generated by incorporating two bicycle\npath types and two right-turn control types. These scenarios were analyzed\nthrough microsimulation on the basis of stopped delay and number of stops.\n  Simulation results revealed that the Offset crossing alternative incurred the\nleast stopped delay for all user classes, including motorized traffic. The\nTraditional crossing generated the least number of stops for most route types.\nThe Midblock crossing can be considered as a supplement to either the Offset or\nTraditional crossing depending on the specific origin-destination patterns at\nthe intersection. The exclusive bicycle path performed better than the\nshared-use path in most cases. When compared with an equivalent standard\nintersection, aggregated results showed significant improvement for all CFI\ncrossing types with respect to stopped delay, but the standard intersection had\nan equal or fewer number of stops for most routes investigated.

Tracking applications are very important in WSNs. This study\nproposes a method for reducing energy consumption in WSNs, considering target\ntracking. A prediction method is also presented with the help of MAC Medium\nAccess Control layer in which a few number of nodes are in active mode to track\nthe target while the rest of the nodes are switched into sleeping mode. Energy\nconsumption was reduced by decreasing the number of nodes involved in target\ntracking and activating merely a limited number of necessary nodes. The\nconducted experiments suggest that the proposed algorithm has a much better\nperformance compared to similar algorithms in different conditions, including\nenergy consumption in different communication ranges, effect of the number of\nnodes on energy consumption, the number of nodes involved in tracking in terms\nof communication range, and losing the target. This means the proposed method\nis superior and more efficient. When the target enters the simulation area,\nnodes of the network identify the target node through the proposed method\n(which is the optimum method) and track it as long as it is inside the\nsimulation area. Performance criteria, including energy, other nodes, and\nthroughput were used in simulation. The results showed that the proposed method\nhas the optimum performance and reduces energy consumption of the network\nduring tracking.

This\ntendency indicates a hysteresis of the effective thermal conductivity, which\noriginates from the difference in the heat input rates at which the MPHP falls\ninto and recovers from dryout. Subsequently, semantic segmentation-based image\nrecognition is applied to the recorded flow images to identify the flow\ncharacteristics, successfully extracting four different flow patterns involving\nliquid slugs, liquid films, dry walls, and rapid-boiling regions. The image\nrecognition results indicate that high effective thermal conductivities of the\nMPHP relate to stable self-oscillations with large amplitudes and high\nfrequencies, along with long and thin liquid films beneficial for latent heat\ntransfer. Finally, we perform numerical simulations of latent/sensible heat\ntransfer via vapor plugs and of sensible heat transfer via liquid slugs using\nthe extracted flow patterns as inputs. We find that latent heat transfer via\nliquid films accounts for a considerable portion of the overall heat transfer,\nwhile the sensible heat transfer via liquid slugs is much less significant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 05:48:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 09:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-11"}
