It is\ncommon to perform the extraction in frequency-domain, and reconstruct the\ntime-domain signal from the extracted magnitude and estimated phase spectra.\nHowever, such an approach is adversely affected by the inherent difficulty of\nphase estimation. Inspired by Conv-TasNet, we propose a time-domain speaker\nextraction network (SpEx) that converts the mixture speech into multi-scale\nembedding coefficients instead of decomposing the speech signal into magnitude\nand phase spectra. In this way, we avoid phase estimation. The SpEx network\nconsists of four network components, namely speaker encoder, speech encoder,\nspeaker extractor, and speech decoder. Specifically, the speech encoder\nconverts the mixture speech into multi-scale embedding coefficients, the\nspeaker encoder learns to represent the target speaker with a speaker\nembedding. The speaker extractor takes the multi-scale embedding coefficients\nand target speaker embedding as input and estimates a receptive mask. Finally,\nthe speech decoder reconstructs the target speaker's speech from the masked\nembedding coefficients. We also propose a multi-task learning framework and a\nmulti-scale embedding implementation. Experimental results show that the\nproposed SpEx achieves 37.3%, 37.7% and 15.0% relative improvements over the\nbest baseline in terms of signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR), scale-invariant SDR\n(SI-SDR), and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) under an open\nevaluation condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 16:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

All DL-NLP models out-performed all of the\nML-NLP models, with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model achieving the\nbest overall performance (Kappa = 0.97 for radiology notes, and Kappa = 1.00\nfor follow-up telephone notes). On the other hand, the ICD/CPT codes of the\npatients who sustained a hip dislocation AE were only 75.24% accurate, showing\nthe potential of the proposed model to be used in largescale orthopaedic\nregistries for accurate and efficient hip dislocation AE detection to improve\nthe quality of care and patient outcome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 16:25:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 18:54:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-26"}

In this paper, we systematically investigate the quantitative\nrelationship between the entanglement and nonlocality of a general two-qubit\nsystem.

The process requires large temporal areas\nof the driving pulsed fields (pump and Stokes) in order to suppress the\nnonadiabatic couplings and thereby to make adiabatic evolution possible. To\nthis end, in the present paper a variation of multistate STIRAP, which\naccelerates and improves the population transfer, is presented. In addition to\nthe usual pump and Stokes fields it uses shortcut fields applied between the\nstates, which form the dark state of the system. The shortcuts cancel the\ncouplings between the dark state and the other adiabatic states thereby\nresulting (in the ideal case) in a unit transition probability between the two\nend states of the chain. Specific examples of five-state systems formed of the\nmagnetic sublevels of the transitions between two degenerate levels with\nangular momenta $J_g=2$ and $J_e=1$ or $J_e=2$ are considered in detail, for\nwhich the shortcut fields are derived analytically. The proposed method is\nsimpler than the usual \"shortcuts to adiabaticity\" recipe, which prescribes\nshortcut fields between all states of the system, while the present proposal\nuses shortcut fields between the sublevels forming the dark state only. The\nresults are of potential interest in applications where high-fidelity quantum\ncontrol is essential, e.g. quantum information, atom optics, formation of\nultracold molecules, cavity QED, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 16:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

The\nmore massive black hole rotated with a dimensionless spin magnitude between\n0.22 and 0.60 (90% probability). Asymmetric systems are predicted to emit\ngravitational waves with stronger contributions from higher multipoles, and\nindeed we find strong evidence for gravitational radiation beyond the leading\nquadrupolar order in the observed signal.

In this work, we present a robust implementation of a\nSemi-Device-Independent QRNG that guarantees both security and fast generation\nrates.

We consider the two most fundamental string metrics: the Hamming\ndistance and the edit distance. Under the Hamming distance, we search for\nsubstrings of $T$ that have at most $k$ mismatches with $P$, while under the\nedit distance, we search for substrings of $T$ that can be transformed to $P$\nwith at most $k$ edits.\n  Exact occurrences of $P$ in $T$ have a very simple structure: If we assume\nfor simplicity that $|T| \\le 3|P|/2$ and trim $T$ so that $P$ occurs both as a\nprefix and as a suffix of $T$, then both $P$ and $T$ are periodic with a common\nperiod. However, an analogous characterization for the structure of occurrences\nwith up to $k$ mismatches was proved only recently by Bringmann et al.\n[SODA'19]: Either there are $O(k^2)$ $k$-mismatch occurrences of $P$ in $T$, or\nboth $P$ and $T$ are at Hamming distance $O(k)$ from strings with a common\nperiod $O(m/k)$. We tighten this characterization by showing that there are\n$O(k)$ $k$-mismatch occurrences in the case when the pattern is not\n(approximately) periodic, and we lift it to the edit distance setting, where we\ntightly bound the number of $k$-edit occurrences by $O(k^2)$ in the\nnon-periodic case. Our proofs are constructive and let us obtain a unified\nframework for approximate pattern matching for both considered distances. We\nshowcase the generality of our framework with results for the fully-compressed\nsetting (where $T$ and $P$ are given as a straight-line program) and for the\ndynamic setting (where we extend a data structure of Gawrychowski et al.\n[SODA'18]).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 17:13:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 10:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

Therefore researchers often seek\nsimpler descriptions that describe complex phenomena without numerically\nresolving all the interacting components. Stochastic differential equations\n(SDEs) arise naturally as models in this context. The growth in data\nacquisition, both through experiment and through simulations, provides an\nopportunity for the systematic derivation of SDE models in many disciplines.\nHowever, inconsistencies between SDEs and real data at short time scales often\ncause problems, when standard statistical methodology is applied to parameter\nestimation. The incompatibility between SDEs and real data can be addressed by\nderiving sufficient statistics from the time-series data and learning\nparameters of SDEs based on these. Following this approach, we formulate the\nfitting of SDEs to sufficient statistics from real data as an inverse problem\nand demonstrate that this inverse problem can be solved by using ensemble\nKalman inversion (EKI). Furthermore, we create a framework for non-parametric\nlearning of drift and diffusion terms by introducing hierarchical, refinable\nparameterizations of unknown functions, using Gaussian process regression.

The model\ninputs are the kick velocity distribution, which we measure customized to V4641\nSgr, and the immediate pre/post-supernova binary system parameters. Using a\ngrid of binary stellar evolution models, we determine post-supernova\nconfigurations that evolve to become consistent with V4641 Sgr today and obtain\nthe corresponding pre-supernova configurations by using standard prescriptions\nfor common envelope evolution.

In this paper, we present the first theoretical model\nto consider all of these physical processes in an attempt to develop an\nevolutionary model for the origin of high-z LABs. This is achieved by combining\na series of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations with ionization\nand Lyman-alpha (Lya) radiative transfer models. We find that massive galaxies\ndisplay a range of Lya luminosities and spatial extents (which strongly depend\non the limiting surface brightness used) over the course of their lives, though\nregularly exhibit luminosities and sizes consistent with observed LABs. The\nmodel LABs are typically powered from a combination of recombination in\nstar-forming galaxies, as well as cooling emission from gas associated with\naccretion. When AGN are included in the model, the fluorescence caused by\nAGN-driven ionization can be a significant contributor to the total Lya\nluminosity as well. We propose that the presence of an AGN may be predicted\nfrom the Gini coefficient of the blob's surface brightness. Within our modeled\nmass range, there are no obvious threshold physical properties that predict\nappearance of LABs, and only weak correlations of the luminosity with the\nphysical properties of the host galaxy.

The latter,\nwhich is predominant at high masses, was not included in previous estimations.\nFurthermore, we account for the possibility that axions decay inside the\nstellar core, a non-negligible effect at the masses and couplings we are\nconsidering here. Consequently, our result modifies considerably the previous\nconstraint, especially for $m_a \\gtrsim 50$ keV.

In this paper, we discuss the dependence of global\nsuper-rotation in terrestrial atmospheres on planetary rotation rate. This\ndependence is revealed through analysis of global super-rotation in idealised\nGeneral Circulation Model experiments with time-independent axisymmetric\nforcing, compared with estimates for global super-rotation in Solar System\natmospheres. Axisymmetric and three-dimensional experiments are conducted. We\nfind that the degree of global super-rotation in the three-dimensional\nexperiments is closely related to that of the axisymmetric experiments, with\nsome differences in detail. A scaling theory for global super-rotation in an\naxisymmetric atmosphere is derived from the Held-Hou model. At high rotation\nrate, our numerical experiments inhabit a regime where global super-rotation\nscales geostrophically, and we suggest that the Earth and Mars occupy this\nregime. At low rotation rate, our experiments occupy a regime determined by\nangular momentum conservation, where global super-rotation is independent of\nrotation rate. Global super-rotation in our experiments saturates at a value\nsignificantly lower than that achieved in the atmospheres of Venus and Titan,\nwhich instead occupy a regime where global super-rotation scales\ncyclostrophically. This regime can only be accessed when eddy induced\nup-gradient angular momentum transport is sufficiently large, which is not the\ncase in our idealised numerical experiments. We suggest that the 'default'\nregime for a slowly rotating planet is the angular momentum conserving regime,\ncharacterised by mild global (and local) superrotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 18:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

By\nanalysing the transmission spectrum of the ultra-hot Jupiter MASCARA-2 b using\nthe cross-correlation method, we confirm previous detections of Fe I, Fe II and\nNa I, which likely originate in the upper regions of the inflated atmosphere.\nIn addition, we report significant detections of Mg I and Cr II. The absorption\nstrengths change slightly with time, possibly indicating different temperatures\nand chemistry in the day-side and night-side terminators. Using the effective\nstellar line-shape variation induced by the transiting planet, we constrain the\nprojected spin-orbit misalignment of the system to $1.6\\pm3.1$ degrees,\nconsistent with an aligned orbit.

In this paper, we study a unique set of Swedish\nspatio-temporal ambulance call data, which consist of the spatial (GPS)\nlocations of the calls (within the four northernmost regions of Sweden) and the\nassociated days of occurrence of the calls (January 1, 2014, to December 31,\n2018). Motivated by the nature of the data, we here employ log-Gaussian Cox\nprocesses (LGCPs) for the spatio-temporal modelling and forecasting of the\ncalls. To this end, we propose a K-means clustering based bandwidth selection\nmethod for the kernel estimation of the spatial component of the separable\nspatio-temporal intensity function. The temporal component of the intensity\nfunction is modelled using Poisson regression, using different calendar\ncovariates, and the spatio-temporal random field component of the random\nintensity of the LGCP is fitted using the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin\nalgorithm. Spatial hot-spots have been found in the south-eastern part of the\nstudy region, where most people in the region live and our fitted\nmodel/forecasts manage to capture this behavior quite well. Also, there is a\nsignificant association between the expected number of calls and the\nday-of-the-week and the season-of-the-year. A non-parametric second-order\nanalysis indicates that LGCPs seem to be reasonable models for the data.\nFinally, we find that the fitted forecasts generate simulated future spatial\nevent patterns that quite well resemble the actual future data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 18:12:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2020 19:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

To ensure that the building\nsimulation is sufficiently accurate, and to better understand the impact of\nimprecisions in the input parameters and calculation methods, it is desirable\nto quantify uncertainty in the BEM throughout the modeling process. Uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) typically requires a large number of simulations to produce\nmeaningful data, which, due to the vast number of input parameters and the\ndynamic nature of building simulation, is computationally expensive.\nUncertainty Quantification (UQ) in BEM domain is thus intractable due to the\nsize of the problem and parameters involved and hence it needs an advanced\nmethodology for analysis.

It promises\nto dramatically speed-up many chemical, financial, and machine-learning\napplications. However, to capitalize on those promises, complex design flows\ncomposed of steps such as compilation, decomposition, or mapping need to be\nemployed before being able to execute a conceptual quantum algorithm on an\nactual device. This results in descriptions at various levels of abstraction\nwhich may significantly differ from each other. The complexity of the\nunderlying design problems necessitates to not only provide efficient solutions\nfor the single steps, but also to verify that the originally intended\nfunctionality is preserved throughout all levels of abstraction. This motivates\nmethods for equivalence checking of quantum circuits. However, most existing\nmethods are inspired by the classical realm and have merely been extended to\nsupport quantum circuits (i.e., circuits which do not only rely on 0's and 1's,\nbut also employ superposition and entanglement). In this work, we propose an\nadvanced methodology which takes the different paradigms of quantum circuits\nnot only as a burden, but as an opportunity. In fact, the proposed methodology\nexplicitly utilizes characteristics unique to quantum computing in order to\novercome the shortcomings of existing approaches. We show that, by exploiting\nthe reversibility of quantum circuits, complexity can be kept feasible in many\ncases. Moreover, we show that, in contrast to the classical realm, simulation\nis very powerful in verifying quantum circuits. Experimental evaluations\nconfirm that the resulting methodology allows one to conduct equivalence\nchecking dramatically faster than ever before--in many cases just a single\nsimulation run is sufficient.

SOARS stratifies across two\ndimensions. The first dimension is that distinct processing pipelines are used\nfor each OAR category.

The second dimension\nis that distinct network architectures are used to manage the significant\ncontrast, size, and anatomy variations between different OARs.

This is an $\\mathcal{NP}$-hard optimization problem where the\naim is to schedule jobs on a single machine such that their total weighted\ntardiness is minimized.

In recent years commutativity has been shown to be a\nkey ingredient to enabling multicore concurrency in contexts such as\nparallelizing compilers, transactional memory, speculative execution and, more\nbroadly, software scalability. Despite this interest, it remains an open\nquestion as to how a data structure's commutativity specification can be\nverified automatically from its implementation.\n  In this paper, we describe techniques to automatically prove the correctness\nof method commutativity conditions from data structure implementations. We\nintroduce a new kind of abstraction that characterizes the ways in which the\neffects of two methods differ depending on the order in which the methods are\napplied, and abstracts away effects of methods that would be the same\nregardless of the order. We then describe a novel algorithm that reduces the\nproblem to reachability, so that off-the-shelf program analysis tools can\nperform the reasoning necessary for proving commutativity. Finally, we describe\na proof-of-concept implementation and experimental results, showing that our\ntool can verify commutativity of data structures such as a memory cell,\ncounter, two-place Set, array-based stack, queue, and a rudimentary hash table.\nWe conclude with a discussion of what makes a data structure's commutativity\nprovable with today's tools and what needs to be done to prove more in the\nfuture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 20:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

Our\nnew criterion for \"loss aversion-sensitive dominance\" defines a weak partial\nordering of the distributions of policy-induced gains and losses. It applies to\nthe class of welfare functions which model individual preferences with\nnon-decreasing and loss-averse attitudes towards changes in outcomes. We also\ndevelop new statistical methods to test loss aversion-sensitive dominance in\npractice, using nonparametric plug-in estimates; these allow inference to be\nconducted through a special resampling procedure. Since point-identification of\nthe distribution of policy-induced gains and losses may require strong\nassumptions, we extend our comparison criteria, test statistics, and resampling\nprocedures to the partially-identified case. We illustrate our methods with a\nsimple empirical application to the welfare comparison of alternative income\nsupport programs in the US.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 22:01:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 21:09:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 21:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

For full\nfour-dimensional (4-D, 2 DOA and 2 polarization parameters) estimation, we\ncould extend the linear crossed-dipole array to the planar case. In this paper,\ninstead of extending the array geometry, we replace the crossed-dipoles by\ntripoles and construct a linear tripole array. It is proved that such a\nstructure can estimate the 2-D DOA and 2-D polarisation information effectively\nin general and a dimension-reduction based MUSIC algorithm is developed so that\nthe 4-D estimation problem can be simplified into two separate 2-D estimation\nproblems, significantly reducing the computational complexity of the solution.\nThe Cramr-Rao Bound (CRB) is also derived as a reference for algorithm\nperformance. A brief comparison between the planar crossed-dipole array and the\nlinear tripole array is performed at last, showing that although the planar\nstructure has a better performance, it is achieved at the cost of increased\nphysical size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 22:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

However, the high cost of computations has so far impeded a\ncomplete analysis of the uncertainty budget of such calculations.

Using a small set of design\nruns, we construct a Gaussian process model (GPM) that acts as a statistical\nemulator for the theory.

In many\nreal-world applications, the time of information discovery is\ndecision-dependent and the uncertain parameters only become observable after an\noften costly investment. Yet, most of the literature assumes that uncertain\nparameters can be observed for free and that the sequence in which they are\nrevealed is independent of the decision-maker's actions. To fill this gap. we\nconsider two- and multi-stage robust optimization problems in which part of the\ndecision variables control the time of information discovery. Thus, information\ncan be discovered (at least in part) by making strategic exploratory\ninvestments in previous stages.

Active contour model, colloquially known\nas snake model, has been studied to extract buildings from aerial and satellite\nimagery. However, this task is still very challenging due to the complexity of\nbuilding size, shape, and its surrounding environment. This complexity leads to\na major obstacle for carrying out a reliable large-scale building extraction,\nsince the involved prior information and assumptions on building such as shape,\nsize, and color cannot be generalized over large areas. This paper presents an\nefficient snake model to overcome such challenge, called Super-Resolution-based\nSnake Model (SRSM). The SRSM operates on high-resolution LiDAR-based elevation\nimages -- called z-images -- generated by a super-resolution process applied to\nLiDAR data. The involved balloon force model is also improved to shrink or\ninflate adaptively, instead of inflating the snake continuously. This method is\napplicable for a large scale such as city scale and even larger, while having a\nhigh level of automation and not requiring any prior knowledge nor training\ndata from the urban scenes (hence unsupervised). It achieves high overall\naccuracy when tested on various datasets.

Here,\nby combining high-throughput ab initio calculations and data-driven machine\nlearning method with new electronic orbital based descriptors, we\nsystematically investigated a large family (2,964) of two-dimensional (2D)\nbimetal phosphates, and discovered 60 stable ferroelectrics with out-of-plane\npolarization, including 16 ferroelectric metals and 44 ferroelectric\nsemiconductors that contain seven multiferroics.

At first, feature extraction is a\nfundamental step. One of these retinal features is the fovea. The fovea is a\nsmall fossa on the fundus. The main vessels diverge from the optic nerve head\nand follow a specific course that can be geometrically modeled as a parabola,\nwith a common vertex inside the optic nerve head and the fovea located along\nthe apex of this parabola curve. Therefore, based on this assumption, the main\nretinal blood vessels are segmented and fitted to a parabolic model. With\nrespect to the core vascular structure, we can thus detect fovea in the fundus\nimages. For the vessel segmentation, our algorithm addresses the image locally\nwhere homogeneity of features is more likely to occur. The algorithm is\ncomposed of 4 steps: multi-overlapping windows, local Radon transform, vessel\nvalidation, and parabolic fitting. In order to extract blood vessels,\nsub-vessels should be extracted in local windows. The high contrast between\nblood vessels and image background in the images cause the vessels to be\nassociated with peaks in the Radon space. The largest vessels, using a high\nthreshold of the Radon transform, determine the main course or overall\nconfiguration of the blood vessels which when fitted to a parabola, leads to\nthe future localization of the fovea. In effect, with an accurate fit, the\nfovea normally lies along the slope joining the vertex and the focus. The\ndarkest region along this line is indicative of the fovea.

Under the ISPRS 3D Semantic Labeling Contest dataset, the DAPnet\noutperforms the benchmark by 85.2\\% with an overall accuracy of 90.7\\%. By\nconducting ablation comparisons, we find that the PAM effectively improves the\nmodel than the GAM. The incorporation of the double self-attention module has\nan average of 7\\% improvement on the pre-class accuracy. Plus, the DAPnet\nconsumes a similar training time to those without the attention modules for\nmodel convergence. The DAPnet can assign different weights to features based on\nthe relevance between point clouds and their neighbors, which effectively\nimproves classification performance.

Concrete examples for such domains include growing biological cells or\nlipid vesicles, biofilms and tissues, but also macroscopic systems such as\nexpanding aquifers during rainy periods, or the expanding universe. The\nconsidered CTRW can be subdiffusive, normal diffusive or superdiffusive,\nincluding the particular case of a L\\'evy flight. We first consider the case of\nzero velocity field. In the subdiffusive case, we reveal an interesting time\ndependence of the kurtosis of the particle probability density function. In\nparticular, for a suitable parameter choice, we find that the propagator, which\nis fat tailed at short times, may cross over to a Gaussian-like propagator. We\nsubsequently incorporate the effect of the velocity field and derive a\nbi-fractional diffusion-advection equation encoding the time evolution of the\nparticle distribution. We apply this equation to study the mixing kinetics of\ntwo diffusing pulses, whose peaks move towards each other under the action of\nvelocity fields acting in opposite directions. This deterministic motion of the\npeaks, together with the diffusive spreading of each pulse, tends to increase\nparticle mixing, thereby counteracting the peak separation induced by the\ndomain growth. As a result of this competition, different regimes of mixing\narise. In the case of L\\'evy flights, apart from the non-mixing regime, one has\ntwo different mixing regimes in the long-time limit, depending on the exact\nparameter choice: In one of these regimes, mixing is mainly driven by diffusive\nspreading, while in the other mixing is controlled by the velocity fields\nacting on each pulse.

However, methods used for this task assume the availability\nof complete and unambiguous labelmaps, with instance boundaries of objects, and\nclass labels for each pixel. This reliance on heavily annotated inputs\nrestricts the application of image synthesis techniques to real-world\napplications, especially under uncertainty due to weather, occlusion, or noise.\nOn the other hand, algorithms that can synthesize images from sparse labelmaps\nor sketches are highly desirable as tools that can guide content creators and\nartists to quickly generate scenes by simply specifying locations of a few\nobjects. In this paper, we address the problem of complex scene completion from\nsparse labelmaps. Under this setting, very few details about the scene (30\\% of\nobject instances) are available as input for image synthesis. We propose a\ntwo-stage deep network based method, called `Halluci-Net', that learns\nco-occurence relationships between objects in scenes, and then exploits these\nrelationships to produce a dense and complete labelmap.

One of the major concerns that these models face is their\nsusceptibility to adversarial attacks. Realizing the importance of this issue,\nmore researchers are working towards developing robust models that are less\naffected by adversarial attacks. Adversarial training method shows promising\nresults in this direction. In adversarial training regime, models are trained\nwith mini-batches augmented with adversarial samples. Fast and simple methods\n(e.g., single-step gradient ascent) are used for generating adversarial\nsamples, in order to reduce computational complexity. It is shown that models\ntrained using single-step adversarial training method (adversarial samples are\ngenerated using non-iterative method) are pseudo robust. Further, this pseudo\nrobustness of models is attributed to the gradient masking effect. However,\nexisting works fail to explain when and why gradient masking effect occurs\nduring single-step adversarial training. In this work, (i) we show that models\ntrained using single-step adversarial training method learn to prevent the\ngeneration of single-step adversaries, and this is due to over-fitting of the\nmodel during the initial stages of training, and (ii) to mitigate this effect,\nwe propose a single-step adversarial training method with dropout scheduling.\nUnlike models trained using existing single-step adversarial training methods,\nmodels trained using the proposed single-step adversarial training method are\nrobust against both single-step and multi-step adversarial attacks, and the\nperformance is on par with models trained using computationally expensive\nmulti-step adversarial training methods, in white-box and black-box settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 2020 14:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

However, in an IoT, edge computing sessions are often\nephemeral, i.e., they last for a short period of time and can often be\ndiscontinued once the current application usage is completed or the edge\ndevices leave the system due to factors such as mobility. Therefore, in this\npaper, the problem of ephemeral edge computing in an IoT is studied by\nconsidering scenarios in which edge computing operates within a limited time\nperiod. To this end, a novel online framework is proposed in which a source\nedge node offloads its computing tasks from sensors within an area to\nneighboring edge nodes for distributed task computing, within the limited\nperiod of time of an ephemeral edge computing system. The online nature of the\nframework allows the edge nodes to optimize their task allocation and decide on\nwhich neighbors to use for task processing, even when the tasks are revealed to\nthe source edge node in an online manner, and the information on future task\narrivals is unknown. The proposed framework essentially maximizes the number of\ncomputed tasks by jointly considering the communication and computation\nlatency. To solve the problem, an online greedy algorithm is proposed and\nsolved by using the primal-dual approach. Since the primal problem provides an\nupper bound of the original dual problem, the competitive ratio of the online\napproach is analytically derived as a function of the task sizes and the data\nrates of the edge nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed online\nalgorithm can achieve a near-optimal task allocation with an optimality gap\nthat is no higher than 7.1% compared to the offline, optimal solution with\ncomplete knowledge of all tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 2020 15:10:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 04:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

One reason is that\nmodel-generated data are always less accurate than real data, and this often\nleads to inaccurate transition and reward function models. With the aim to\nmitigate this problem, this work presents the notion of survival by discussing\ncases in which the agent's goal is to survive and its analogy to maximizing the\nexpected rewards.

However, due to the\nsampling cost in sensing and transmission, a user may not have the incentive to\ncontribute the real-time information to help reduce the age of information\n(AoI). We propose dynamic pricing for each zone to offer age-dependent monetary\nreturns and encourage users to sample information at different rates over time.\nThis dynamic pricing design problem needs to well balance the monetary payments\nas rewards to users and the AoI evolution over time, and is challenging to\nsolve especially under the incomplete information about users' arrivals and\ntheir private sampling costs. After formulating the problem as a nonlinear\nconstrained dynamic program, to avoid the curse of dimensionality, we first\npropose to approximate the dynamic AoI reduction as a time-average term and\nsuccessfully solve the approximate dynamic pricing in closed-form.
