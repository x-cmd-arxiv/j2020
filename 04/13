By treating the multiple nodules from a\nsame patient as a whole, critical relational information between\nsolitary-nodule voxels is extracted.

Recent work has shown, however, that using a controller to\nguide the learning process by leveraging available knowledge of system dynamics\nto aid task satisfaction is greatly beneficial for improving the sample\nefficiency of the method. Motivated by these findings, this work introduces a\ncontroller derivation framework which naturally leads to computationally\nefficient controllers capable of offering such guidance during the learning\nprocess. The derived controllers aim to satisfy a set of so-called robustness\nspecifications or funnels that are imposed on the temporal evolutions of the\natomic propositions composing the STL task. Ideally, these specifications are\nprescribed in a way such that their satisfaction would lead to satisfaction of\nthe STL task. In practice, however, such ideal funnels are not necessarily\nknown a priori, and the guidance the controller offers depends on their\nestimates.

The challenge naturally arises of how to characterise them. In\nparticular, how can a dilaton---the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated\nwith approximate scale invariance---be distinguished from other generic light\nscalars with the same quantum numbers? We address this problem within the\ncontext of gauge-gravity dualities, by analysing the fluctuations of the\nhigher-dimensional gravitational theory. The diagnostic test that we propose\nconsists of comparing the results of the complete calculation, performed by\nusing gauge-invariant fluctuations in the bulk, with the results obtained in\nthe probe approximation. While the former captures the mixing between scalar\nand metric degrees of freedom, the latter removes by hand the fluctuations that\nsource the dilatation operator of the boundary field-theory. Hence, the probe\napproximation cannot capture a possible light dilaton, while it should fare\nwell for other scalar particles. We test this idea on a number of holographic\nmodels, among which are some of the best known, complete gravity backgrounds\nconstructed within the top-down approach to gauge-gravity dualities. We compute\nthe spectra of scalar and tensor fluctuations, that are interpreted as bound\nstates (glueballs) of the dual field theory, and we highlight those cases in\nwhich the probe approximation yields results close to the correct physical\nones, as well as those cases where significant discrepancies emerge.

While the general structure of the short-range potential\nbetween heavy hadrons is heavily constrained from heavy-quark symmetry, the\ncouplings are still free parameters.

The proof\nrelies on a convergence result in the $H^{1}$-norm for a sequence of\n$L^{2}$-orthogonal projections on finite-dimensional subspaces spanned by\nelements of a special Fourier basis. However, due to the ill-posed nature of\ncoefficient inverse problems, we cannot prove that the solution of that\napproximate PDE, which results from the minimization of that Tikhonov-like\nfunctional, converges to the correct solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2020 18:01:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 03:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

This similarity has brought up the feasibility of utilizing\nHe II for high Reynolds number classical turbulence research, considering the\nsmall kinematic viscosity of He II. However, it has been suggested that the\nnon-classical dissipation mechanism in He II at small scales may alter its\nturbulent statistics and intermittency. In this work, we report our study of a\nnearly homogeneous and isotropic turbulence (HIT) generated by a towed grid in\nHe II. We measure the velocity field using particle tracking velocimetry with\nsolidified deuterium particles as the tracers. By correlating the velocities\nmeasured simultaneously on different particle trajectories or at different\ntimes along the same particle trajectory, we are able to conduct both Eulerian\nand Lagrangian flow analyses. Spatial velocity structure functions obtained\nthrough the Eulerian analysis show scaling behaviors in the inertial subrange\nsimilar to that for classical HIT but with enhanced intermittency. The\nLagrangian analysis allows us to examine the flow statistics down to below the\ndissipation length scale.

Following the key insight that\nthe number of operations decreases quadratically with the sparsity of\nembeddings provided the non-zero entries are distributed uniformly across\ndimensions, we propose a novel approach to learn such distributed sparse\nembeddings via the use of a carefully constructed regularization function that\ndirectly minimizes a continuous relaxation of the number of floating-point\noperations (FLOPs) incurred during retrieval.

The\nobtained dressed states due to mutual interaction between Dirac electrons and\nincident light are shown to demonstrate rather different electronic and optical\nproperties in comparison with those in the absence of incident light.\nSpecifically, various collective transport and optical properties of these\nelectron dressed states are discussed in detail and compared for both single-\nand double layer $\\alpha$-$\\mathcal{T}_3$ lattices. All of these novel\nproperties are due to the presence of a middle flat band and the interband\ntransitions between it and an upper conduction band.

Our\nproposed PatchAttack is query efficient and can break models for both targeted\nand non-targeted attacks. PatchAttack induces misclassifications by\nsuperimposing small textured patches on the input image. We parametrize the\nappearance of these patches by a dictionary of class-specific textures.

The absence of any vaccine as well as any definitive\ndrug to cure, has made the situation very grave. Therefore only few effective\ntools are available to contain the rapid pace of spread of this disease, named\nas COVID-19. On 24th March, 2020, the the Union Government of India made an\nannouncement of unprecedented complete lockdown of the entire country effective\nfrom the next day. No exercise of similar scale and magnitude has been ever\nundertaken anywhere on the globe in the history of entire mankind. This study\naims to scientifically analyze the implications of this decision using a\nkinetic model covering more than 96% of Indian territory. This model was\nfurther constrained by large sets of realistic parameters pertinent to India in\norder to capture the ground realities prevailing in India, such as: (i) true\nstate wise population density distribution, (ii) accurate state wise infection\ndistribution for the zeroth day of simulation (20th March, 2020), (iii)\nrealistic movements of average clusters, (iv) rich diversity in movements\npatterns across different states, (v) migration patterns across different\ngeographies, (vi) different migration patterns for pre- and post-COVID-19\noutbreak, (vii) Indian demographic data based on the 2011 census, (viii) World\nHealth Organization (WHO) report on demography wise infection rate and (ix)\nincubation period as per WHO report. This model does not attempt to make a\nlong-term prediction about the disease spread on a standalone basis; but to\ncompare between two different scenarios (complete lockdown vs. no lockdown). In\nthe framework of model assumptions, our model conclusively shows significant\nsuccess of the lockdown in containing the disease within a tiny fraction of the\npopulation and in the absence of it, it would have led to a very grave\nsituation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2020 19:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

This work makes a number of related contributions. First, it\nrelates the specification of branching dependency structures, which exist in\nfields from knowledge-representation to package management, to the\nspecification of semantics of concurrent computation. Second, it relates\ndependency structures to lattices in a precise way, establishing a full\ncorrespondence with a particular subclass of lattices.

This goal is often hard to attain given the\nirregular nature of cloud computing jobs. These jobs expect high QoS on an\non-demand fashion, that is on random arrival. To optimize the response to such\nclient demands, cloud service providers organize the cloud computing\nenvironment as a multi-tier architecture. Each tier executes its designated\ntasks and passes the job to the next tier; in a fashion similar, but not\nidentical, to the traditional job-shop environments. An optimization process\nmust take place to schedule the appropriate tasks of the job on the resources\nof the tier, so as to meet the QoS expectations of the job. Existing approaches\nemploy scheduling strategies that consider the performance optimization at the\nindividual resource level and produce optimal single-tier driven schedules. Due\nto the sequential nature of the multi-tier environment, the impact of such\nschedules on the performance of other resources and tiers tend to be ignored,\nresulting in a less than optimal performance when measured at the multi-tier\nlevel. In this paper, we propose a multi-tier-oriented job scheduling and\nallocation technique. The scheduling and allocation process is formulated as a\nproblem of assigning jobs to the resource queues of the cloud computing\nenvironment, where each resource of the environment employs a queue to hold the\njobs assigned to it. The scheduling problem is NP-hard, as such a biologically\ninspired genetic algorithm is proposed. The computing resources across all\ntiers of the environment are virtualized in one resource by means of a single\nqueue virtualization. A chromosome that mimics the sequencing and allocation of\nthe tasks in the proposed virtual queue is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2020 21:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

It is typical that a\nService-Level-Agreement (SLA) is employed to govern the QoS obligations of the\ncloud computing service provider to the client. A typical challenge\nservice-providers face every day is maintaining a balance between the limited\nresources available for computing and the high QoS requirements of varying\nrandom demands. Any imbalance in managing these conflicting objectives may\nresult in either dissatisfied clients and potentially significant commercial\npenalties, or an over-resourced cloud computing environment that can be\nsignificantly costly to acquire and operate. Thus, scheduling the clients'\nworkloads as they arrive at the environment to ensure their timely execution\nhas been a central issue in cloud computing. Various approaches have been\nreported in the literature to address this problem: Shortest-Queue,\nJoin-Idle-Queue, Round Robin, MinMin, MaxMin, and Least Connection, to name a\nfew. However, optimization strategies of such approaches fail to capture QoS\nobligations and their associated commercial penalties. This paper presents an\napproach for service-level driven load scheduling and balancing in multi-tier\nenvironments. Joint scheduling and balancing operations are employed to\ndistribute and schedule jobs among the resources, such that the total waiting\ntime of client jobs is minimized, and thus the potential of a penalty to be\nincurred by the service provider is mitigated. A penalty model is used to\nquantify the penalty the service provider incurs as a function of the jobs'\ntotal waiting time. A Virtual-Queue abstraction is proposed to facilitate\noptimal job scheduling at the tier level. This problem is NP-complete, a\ngenetic algorithm is proposed for computing job schedules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2020 21:03:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

Here, we use HST/WFPC2 data of\nNGC 1711, a stellar cluster in the Large Magellanic Cloud, as a test case to\nexplore a range of possible determinations of the MF from a single dataset. We\nemploy the analytic modified lognormal power-law (MLP) distribution, a hybrid\nfunction that has a peaked lognormal-like body and a power-law tail at\nintermediate and high masses.

A key factor in slowing down the virus\npropagation is the rapid diagnosis and isolation of infected patients. The\nstandard method for COVID-19 identification, the Reverse transcription\npolymerase chain reaction method, is time-consuming and in short supply due to\nthe pandemic. Thus, researchers have been looking for alternative screening\nmethods and deep learning applied to chest X-rays of patients has been showing\npromising results. Despite their success, the computational cost of these\nmethods remains high, which imposes difficulties to their accessibility and\navailability. Thus, the main goal of this work is to propose an accurate yet\nefficient method in terms of memory and processing time for the problem of\nCOVID-19 screening in chest X-rays. Methods: To achieve the defined objective\nwe exploit and extend the EfficientNet family of deep artificial neural\nnetworks which are known for their high accuracy and low footprints in other\napplications. We also exploit the underlying taxonomy of the problem with a\nhierarchical classifier. A dataset of 13,569 X-ray images divided into healthy,\nnon-COVID-19 pneumonia, and COVID-19 patients is used to train the proposed\napproaches and other 5 competing architectures. Finally, 231 images of the\nthree classes were used to assess the quality of the methods. Results: The\nresults show that the proposed approach was able to produce a high-quality\nmodel, with an overall accuracy of 93.9%, COVID-19, sensitivity of 96.8% and\npositive prediction of 100%, while having from 5 to 30 times fewer parameters\nthan other than the other tested architectures.

Two types of features are fed\ninto a two-layer fully connected neural network to estimate the cross-modality\ncorrespondence. The three networks are jointly trained (i.e. cross-modality) by\nverifying whether two sampled data of different modalities belong to the same\nobject, meanwhile, the 2D convolutional neural network is additionally\noptimized through minimizing intra-object distance while maximizing\ninter-object distance of rendered images in different views (i.e. cross-view).\nThe effectiveness of the learned 2D and 3D features is evaluated by\ntransferring them on five different tasks including multi-view 2D shape\nrecognition, 3D shape recognition, multi-view 2D shape retrieval, 3D shape\nretrieval, and 3D part-segmentation.

However, acquiring high-quality\ntranslation pairs requires expert knowledge and is costly. Therefore, how to\nbest utilize a given dataset of samples with diverse quality and\ncharacteristics becomes an important yet understudied question in NMT.\nCurriculum learning methods have been introduced to NMT to optimize a model's\nperformance by prescribing the data input order, based on heuristics such as\nthe assessment of noise and difficulty levels. However, existing methods\nrequire training from scratch, while in practice most NMT models are\npre-trained on big data already. Moreover, as heuristics, they do not\ngeneralize well.

In this paper, to enhance the quality of the degranulation\n(reconstruction) process, we augment the FCM-based degranulation mechanism by\nintroducing a vector of fuzzification factors (fuzzification factor vector) and\nsetting up an adjustment mechanism to modify the prototypes and the partition\nmatrix. The design is regarded as an optimization problem, which is guided by a\nreconstruction criterion. In the proposed scheme, the initial partition matrix\nand prototypes are generated by the FCM. Then a fuzzification factor vector is\nintroduced to form an appropriate fuzzification factor for each cluster to\nbuild up an adjustment scheme of modifying the prototypes and the partition\nmatrix. With the supervised learning mode of the granulation-degranulation\nprocess, we construct a composite objective function of the fuzzification\nfactor vector, the prototypes and the partition matrix. Subsequently, the\nparticle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to optimize the fuzzification\nfactor vector to refine the prototypes and develop the optimal partition\nmatrix. Finally, the reconstruction performance of the FCM algorithm is\nenhanced. We offer a thorough analysis of the developed scheme. In particular,\nwe show that the classical FCM algorithm forms a special case of the proposed\nscheme. Experiments completed for both synthetic and publicly available\ndatasets show that the proposed approach outperforms the generic data\nreconstruction approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 04:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

The\nemergence of deep learning leads to a recent shift in the research of HAR,\nwhich requires massive strictly labeled data. In comparison with video data,\nactivity data recorded from accelerometer or gyroscope is often more difficult\nto interpret and segment. Recently, several attention mechanisms are proposed\nto handle the weakly labeled human activity data, which do not require accurate\ndata annotation. However, these attention-based models can only handle the\nweakly labeled dataset whose sample includes one target activity, as a result\nit limits efficiency and practicality. In the paper, we propose a recurrent\nattention networks (RAN) to handle sequential weakly labeled multi-activity\nrecognition and location tasks. The model can repeatedly perform steps of\nattention on multiple activities of one sample and each step is corresponding\nto the current focused activity. The effectiveness of the RAN model is\nvalidated on a collected sequential weakly labeled multi-activity dataset and\nthe other two public datasets. The experiment results show that our RAN model\ncan simultaneously infer multi-activity types from the coarse-grained\nsequential weak labels and determine specific locations of every target\nactivity with only knowledge of which types of activities contained in the long\nsequence.

However, the flexibility of\nthese dockless systems comes at the cost of management and operation\ncomplexity. Indeed, the imbalanced and dynamic use of bikes leads to mandatory\nrebalancing operations, which impose a critical need for effective bike traffic\nflow prediction. While efforts have been made in developing traffic flow\nprediction models, existing approaches lack interpretability, and thus have\nlimited value in practical deployment. To this end, we propose an Interpretable\nBike Flow Prediction (IBFP) framework, which can provide effective bike flow\nprediction with interpretable traffic patterns. Specifically, by dividing the\nurban area into regions according to flow density, we first model the\nspatio-temporal bike flows between regions with graph regularized sparse\nrepresentation, where graph Laplacian is used as a smooth operator to preserve\nthe commonalities of the periodic data structure. Then, we extract traffic\npatterns from bike flows using subspace clustering with sparse representation\nto construct interpretable base matrices. Moreover, the bike flows can be\npredicted with the interpretable base matrices and learned parameters. Finally,\nexperimental results on real-world data show the advantages of the IBFP method\nfor flow prediction in dockless bike sharing systems. In addition, the\ninterpretability of our flow pattern exploitation is further illustrated\nthrough a case study where IBFP provides valuable insights into bike flow\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 05:31:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

A\nlocal high-order limiting projection is also devised to remove spurious\noscillations and noises in numerical solutions, which allows the numerical\nmodel working well alone without artificial diffusion or filter. The resulted\nnumerical schemes are very simple, efficient and easy to implement for both\nstructured and unstructured grids, which provide a promising plateform of great\npractical significance. We have implemented the MCV method to shallow water\nequations on various spherical grids, including Yin-Yang overset grid, cubed\nsphere grid and geodesic icosahedral grid, non-hydrostatic compressible\natmosherical model under complex topographic boundary conditions.

For exploring\nthe natures of SAX J1712.6-3739 and its thermonuclear bursts, we analyzed its\nfour bursts which were all captured by Swift/BAT. The peak flux and fluence for\nthese bursts are derived by applying the archive observation data of Swift/BAT\nand Swift/XRT.

The corresponding absolute magnitude and average\naccretion rate agree its ultra-compact X-ray binary nature.

In these\nmetropolises, criminal activity is much higher and violent than in either small\ncities or rural areas. Thus, understanding what factors influence urban crime\nin big cities is a pressing need. Mainstream studies analyse crime records\nthrough historical panel data or analysis of historical patterns combined with\necological factor and exploratory mapping. More recently, machine learning\nmethods have provided informed crime prediction over time. However, previous\nstudies have focused on a single city at a time, considering only a limited\nnumber of factors (such as socio-economical characteristics) and often at large\nspatial units. Hence, our understanding of the factors influencing crime across\ncultures and cities is very limited.

To that end, we integrate multiple open data sources with\nmobile phone traces and compare how the different factors correlate with crime\nin diverse cities, namely Boston, Bogot\\'a, Los Angeles and Chicago. We find\nthat the combined use of socio-economic conditions, mobility information and\nphysical characteristics of the neighbourhood effectively explain the emergence\nof crime, and improve the performance of the traditional approaches.

Having achieved this stage, a natural PPDE is found so\nthat the adapted solution of the backward SVIEs admits a representation in\nterms of the solution to the forward SVIE via the solution to a PPDE. On the\nother hand, the solution of the PPDE admits a representation in terms of\nadapted solution to the (path dependent) FBSVIE, which is referred to as a\nFeynman-Kac formula. This leads to the existence and uniqueness of a classical\nsolution to the PPDE, under smoothness conditions on the coefficients of the\nFBSVIEs. Further, when the smoothness conditions are relaxed with the backward\ncomponent of FBSVIE being one-dimensional, a new (and suitable) notion of\nviscosity solution is introduced for the PPDE, for which a comparison principle\nof the viscosity solutions is established, leading to the uniqueness of the\nviscosity solution.

In order to achieve the objectives, we have\nproposed a classification schema considering the multi-class and hierarchical\nperspectives, since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy. Given the\nnatural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling\nalgorithms in order to re-balance the classes distribution. Our classification\nschema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also\nusing a pre-trained CNN model. We also explored early and late fusion\ntechniques in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors\nand base classifiers at once. To evaluate the approach, we composed a database,\nnamed RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different\npathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs. The classes distribution\nfollows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than\nothers. The proposed approach achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a\nmulti-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in\nthe hierarchical classification scenario. As far as we know, we achieved the\nbest nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced\nenvironment with more than three classes. We must also highlight the novel\nproposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers\nthe types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the\nbest COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 09:22:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 21:46:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 14:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

The phase noise\nof the optical carrier, serving for electro-optic signal transduction, is shown\nnot to propagate to the reconstructed digitized signal and therefore not to\nrepresent a fundamental limit. The optical phase noise of the MLL used to\ngenerate reference tones for individual slices also does not fundamentally\nimpact the converted signal, so long as it remains correlated among all the\ncomb lines. On the other hand, the timing jitter of the MLL, as also reflected\nin its RF linewidth, is fundamentally limiting the ADC performance, since it is\ndirectly mapped as jitter to the converted signal. The hybrid nature of a\nphotonically enabled, spectrally sliced ADC implies the utilization of a number\nof reduced bandwidth electrical ADCs to convert parallel slices, resulting in\nthe propagation of jitter from the electrical oscillator supplying their clock.\nDue to the reduced sampling rate of the electrical ADCs, as compared to the\noverall system, the overall noise performance of the presented architecture is\nsubstantially improved with respect to a fully electrical ADC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 09:24:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

An implementation meeting an\nincomplete specification may still have a lot of bugs. In testing, this issue\nis addressed by replacing functional completeness with $\\mathit{structural}$\none. The latter is achieved by generating a set of tests probing every piece of\na design implementation. We show that a similar approach can be used in formal\nverification. The idea here is to generate a property of the implementation at\nhand that is not implied by the specification. Finding such a property means\nthat the specification is not complete. If this is an $\\mathit{unwanted}$\nproperty, the implementation is buggy. Otherwise, a new specification property\nneeds to be added. Generation of implementation properties related to different\nparts of the design followed by adding new specification properties produces a\n$\\mathit{structurally}$-$\\mathit{complete\\:specification}$. Implementation\nproperties are built by $\\mathit{partial\\: quantifier\\:elimination}$, a\ntechnique where only a part of the formula is taken out of the scope of\nquantifiers. An implementation property is generated by applying partial\nquantifier elimination to a formula defining the \"truth table\" of the\nimplementation.

A number of necessary and sufficient conditions for macrorealism\nhave been derived for a dichtomic variable using sets of Leggett-Garg (LG)\ninequalities, or the stronger no-signaling in time (NSIT) conditions, or a\ncombination thereof. Here, we extend this framework by establishing necessary\nand sufficient conditions for macrorealism for measurements made at two and\nthree times for systems described by variables taking three or more values at\neach time.

Although\nexisting approaches such as Dropout are widely used to address the overfitting\nproblem, these methods are typically designed for regularizing models of a\nsingle task in supervised training. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet\neffective method to alleviate the risk of overfitting for gradient-based\nmeta-learning. Specifically, during the gradient-based adaptation stage, we\nrandomly drop the gradient in the inner-loop optimization of each parameter in\ndeep neural networks, such that the augmented gradients improve generalization\nto new tasks. We present a general form of the proposed gradient dropout\nregularization and show that this term can be sampled from either the Bernoulli\nor Gaussian distribution. To validate the proposed method, we conduct extensive\nexperiments and analysis on numerous computer vision tasks, demonstrating that\nthe gradient dropout regularization mitigates the overfitting problem and\nimproves the performance upon various gradient-based meta-learning frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 10:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

In this paper, we study how changes of the time labels,\ncorresponding to delays on the availability of the edges, affect the\nreachability sets from given sources. The questions about reachability sets are\nmotivated by numerous applications of temporal graphs in network epidemiology,\nwhich aim to minimise the spread of infection, and scheduling problems in\nsupply networks in manufacturing with the opposite objectives of maximising\ncoverage and productivity. We introduce control mechanisms for reachability\nsets that are based on two natural operations of delaying. The first operation,\ntermed merging, is global and batches together consecutive time labels into a\nsingle time label in the whole network simultaneously. This corresponds to\npostponing all events until a particular time. The second, imposes independent\ndelays on the time labels of every edge of the graph. We provide a thorough\ninvestigation of the computational complexity of different objectives related\nto reachability sets when these operations are used. For the merging operation,\ni.e. global lockdown effect, we prove NP-hardness results for several\nminimization and maximization reachability objectives, even for very simple\ngraph structures.

One big challenge for\ndata-driven AU intensity estimation is the lack of sufficient AU label data.\nDue to the fact that AU annotation requires strong domain expertise, it is\nexpensive to construct an extensive database to learn deep models. The limited\nnumber of labeled AUs as well as identity differences and pose variations\nfurther increases the estimation difficulties. Considering all these\ndifficulties, we propose an unsupervised framework GE-Net for facial AU\nintensity estimation from a single image, without requiring any annotated AU\ndata. Our framework performs differentiable optimization, which iteratively\nupdates the facial parameters (i.e., head pose, AU parameters and identity\nparameters) to match the input image. GE-Net consists of two modules: a\ngenerator and a feature extractor. The generator learns to \"render\" a face\nimage from a set of facial parameters in a differentiable way, and the feature\nextractor extracts deep features for measuring the similarity of the rendered\nimage and input real image. After the two modules are trained and fixed, the\nframework searches optimal facial parameters by minimizing the differences of\nthe extracted features between the rendered image and the input image.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art\nresults compared with existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 12:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

However, these models\nare huge in size, with millions (and even billions) of parameters, thus\ndemanding more heavy computation power and failing to be deployed on edge\ndevices. Besides, the performance boost is highly dependent on redundant\nlabeled data. To achieve faster speeds and to handle the problems caused by the\nlack of data, knowledge distillation (KD) has been proposed to transfer\ninformation learned from one model to another. KD is often characterized by the\nso-called `Student-Teacher' (S-T) learning framework and has been broadly\napplied in model compression and knowledge transfer. This paper is about KD and\nS-T learning, which are being actively studied in recent years. First, we aim\nto provide explanations of what KD is and how/why it works. Then, we provide a\ncomprehensive survey on the recent progress of KD methods together with S-T\nframeworks typically for vision tasks. In general, we consider some fundamental\nquestions that have been driving this research area and thoroughly generalize\nthe research progress and technical details.

The theory describes\nangular momentum transfer between different degrees of freedom in solids, e.g.,\nthe electron orbital and spin, the crystal lattice, and the magnetic order\nparameter. Based on the continuity equations for the spin and orbital angular\nmomenta, we derive equations of motion that relate spin and orbital current\nfluxes and torques describing the transfer of angular momentum between\ndifferent degrees of freedom. We then propose a classification scheme for the\nmechanisms of the current-induced torque in magnetic bilayers. Based on our\nfirst-principles implementation, we apply our formalism to two different\nmagnetic bilayers, Fe/W(110) and Ni/W(110), which are chosen such that the\norbital and spin Hall effects in W have opposite sign and the resulting spin-\nand orbital-mediated torques can compete with each other. We find that while\nthe spin torque arising from the spin Hall effect of W is the dominant\nmechanism of the current-induced torque in Fe/W(110), the dominant mechanism in\nNi/W(110) is the orbital torque originating in the orbital Hall effect of W. It\nleads to negative and positive effective spin Hall angles, respectively, which\ncan be directly identified in experiments. This clearly demonstrates that our\nformalism is ideal for studying the angular momentum transfer dynamics in\nspin-orbit coupled systems as it goes beyond the \"spin current picture\" by\nnaturally incorporating the spin and orbital degrees of freedom on an equal\nfooting. Our calculations reveal that, in addition to the spin and orbital\ntorque, other contributions such as the interfacial torque and self-induced\nanomalous torque within the ferromagnet are not negligible in both material\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 14:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 18:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

B-spline interpolation (BSI) is a popular technique\nin the context of medical imaging due to its adaptability and robustness in 3D\nobject modeling. A field that utilizes BSI is Image Guided Surgery (IGS). IGS\nprovides navigation using medical images, which can be segmented and\nreconstructed into 3D models, often through BSI. Image registration tasks also\nuse BSI to align pre-operative data to intra-operative data. However, such IGS\ntasks are computationally demanding, especially when applied to 3D medical\nimages, due to the complexity and amount of data involved. Therefore,\noptimization of IGS algorithms is greatly desirable, for example, to perform\nimage registration tasks intra-operatively and to enable real-time\napplications. A traditional CPU does not have sufficient computing power to\nachieve these goals. In this paper, we introduce a novel GPU implementation of\nBSI to accelerate the calculation of the deformation field in non-rigid image\nregistration algorithms.\n  Methods. Our BSI implementation on GPUs minimizes the data that needs to be\nmoved between memory and processing cores during loading of the input grid, and\nleverages the large on-chip GPU register file for reuse of input values.\nMoreover, we re-formulate our method as trilinear interpolations to reduce\ncomputational complexity and increase accuracy. To provide pre-clinical\nvalidation of our method and demonstrate its benefits in medical applications,\nwe integrate our improved BSI into a registration workflow for compensation of\nliver deformation (caused by pneumoperitoneum, i.e., inflation of the abdomen)\nand evaluate its performance.\n  Results.

To\novercome the limitation of handcraft features, we propose to train an\nend-to-end network to directly output pixel-wise displacement field between two\nfingerprints. The proposed network includes a siamese network for feature\nembedding, and a following encoder-decoder network for regressing displacement\nfield. By applying displacement fields reliably estimated by tracing high\nquality fingerprint videos to challenging fingerprints, we synthesize a large\nnumber of training fingerprint pairs with ground truth displacement fields. In\naddition, based on the proposed registration algorithm, we propose a\nfingerprint mosaicking method based on optimal seam selection. Registration and\nmatching experiments on FVC2004 databases, Tsinghua Distorted Fingerprint (TDF)\ndatabase, and NIST SD27 latent fingerprint database show that our registration\nmethod outperforms previous dense registration methods in accuracy and\nefficiency.

The former property (TD) is finite\nfor neutron stars but vanishes for black holes (in general relativity), whereas\nthe latter is finite for black holes and negligible for neutron stars, and\naffects the GW phase evolution of binaries in a distinctly different way. We\nintroduce waveform parameters that characterize the strength of tidal-heating,\nand are zero when there is no horizon. We develop Bayesian methods that use TD\nand TH for distinguishing the presence or absence of horizons in a binary. This\nis timely owing to several claims that these stellar-mass objects, especially,\nwith masses heavier than those of neutron stars, may not have a horizon but may\nbe black hole mimickers or exotic compact objects (ECOs). It is also\nastrophysically important to have the tools to test the presence or absence of\nhorizons in mass-gap binaries and, thereby, help detect the heaviest neutron\nstar or the lightest black hole. A proper accounting of tidal-heating in binary\nwaveform models will also be critical for an unbiased measurement of\ncharacteristics of the equation of state of neutron stars in GW observations of\nbinaries containing them -- or even to probe the existence of ECOs.

However, wireless channels over the mmWave band\nusually have one or two paths only due to the severe attenuation. The channel\nproperty restricts its development in the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\nsystem, which can improve throughput by increasing the spectral efficiency.\nRecent development in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) provides new\nopportunities to mmWave communications. In this study, we propose a mmWave\nsystem, which used low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), with the\naid of several RIS arrays. Moreover, each RIS array has many reflectors with\ndiscrete phase shift. By employing the linear spatial processing, these arrays\nform a synthetic channel with increased spatial diversity and power gain, which\ncan support MIMO transmission. We develop a MIMO detector according to the\ncharacteristics of the synthetic channel.

A gradient\nboosting classifier (GBC) is used to distinguish the internal faults from the\ntransient disturbances based on 1.5 cycles of 3-phase differential currents\nregistered by a change detector. After the detection of an internal fault, GBCs\nare used to locate the faulty unit (Power Transformer, PAR series, or exciting\nunit) and identify the type of fault. In case a transient disturbance is\ndetected, another GBC classifies them into the six transient disturbances.

The system is then released\nfor natural evaporation without applying any external perturbation. Infrared\nthermography and optical profilometry were used as essential tools for\ninterfacial temperature measurements and quantification of the coffee-ring\ndimensions, respectively. Initially, a significant temperature gradient exists\nalong the liquid-gas interface as soon as the droplet is deposited on the\nsubstrate which triggers a Marangoni stress-induced recirculation flow directed\nfrom the top of the droplet towards the contact line along the liquid-gas\ninterface. Thus, the flow is in the reverse direction to that seen in the\nconventional substrate heating case. Interestingly, this temperature gradient\ndecays rapidly -- within the first 10% of the total evaporation time and the\ndroplet-substrate system reaches thermal equilibrium with ambient thereafter.\nDespite fast decay of the temperature gradient, the coffee-ring dimensions\nsignificantly diminish, leading to an inner deposit. This suppression of the\ncoffee-ring effect is attributed to the fact that the initial Marangoni\nstress-induced recirculation flow continues until the last stage of the\nevaporation, even after the interfacial temperature gradient vanishes. This is\nessentially a consequence of liquid inertia.

In this study, we address some of the main unresolved\nissues regarding these models.

Moreover, these models are infamous for\nproducing over-confident predictions and for failing silently when presented\nwith out-of-distribution (OOD) data at test time. In this paper, we advocate\nfor multi-task learning, i.e., training a single model on several different\ndatasets, spanning several different organs of interest and different imaging\nmodalities. We show that not only a single CNN learns to automatically\nrecognize the context and accurately segment the organ of interest in each\ncontext, but also that such a joint model often has more accurate and\nbetter-calibrated predictions than dedicated models trained separately on each\ndataset.

Based on the quantum mechanical description it is\nshown that the method of approximation of the moduli of elasticity of a crystal\nby the model of an isotropic medium, proposed earlier in [2], follows from the\nrequirement of the minimal difference between the free energies of a crystal\nand an approximating isotropic medium. The two-parametric Debye model is\nformulated, which, in contrast to the standard model where the average speed of\nphonons is introduced, takes into account the existence in an isotropic medium\nof both longitudinal and transverse phonons. The proposed model contains,\nexcept the Debye energy, an additional dimensionless parameter and,\nconsequently, the law of corresponding states for the heat capacity being\ncharacteristic of the standard model does not hold. With taking account of the\ntwo phonon branches the structure of the density of phonon states proves to be\nmore complex as compared to the standard model and has a singularity that\nresembles Van Hove singularities in real crystals. As an example, an\napplication of the two-parametric Debye theory to such crystals of the cubic\nsystem as tungsten, copper, lead is considered.

This\nis leading to an entropic reinterpretation of UV divergent contributions to CC\nand HH: we will show that, in both the cases, the large number of\nre-scatterings on the hairon ensamble suppresses any radiative instabilities.\nThe CC and HH problems are illusions envisaged by a conscious observer, having\naccess on the limited amount of informations from SM tests: both the issues are\noriginated from our ignorance of the hidden entropy intrinsically stored in the\nspace-time. The HN suggests to search for effective decoherence effects in\nparticle physics observables such as effective CPT, Unitarity and Energy\nviolations. Regarding the HH, the HN does not introduce any new particles or\ninteractions around the TeV-scale: we do not expect for any signatures, at LHC\nand any future high energy colliders, related to the Higgs UV completion in a\nWilsonian sense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 07:33:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 15:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

We use this metric to quantitatively compare\nsimulations to experimental images, experimental images to each other, and to\nestimate the morphological parameters of the experimental images with\nuncertainty.

One\nsuch method is femto-caching, which, despite its great potential, imposes\nseveral challenges such as efficient resource management. We study a resource\nallocation problem for joint caching and transmission in small cell networks,\nwhere the system operates in two consecutive phases: (i) cache placement, and\n(ii) joint file- and transmit power selection followed by broadcasting. We\ndefine the utility of every small base station in terms of the number of\nsuccessful reconstructions per unit of transmission power. We then formulate\nthe problem as to select a file from the cache together with a transmission\npower level for every broadcast round so that the accumulated utility over the\nhorizon is maximized. The former problem boils down to a stochastic knapsack\nproblem, and we cast the latter as a multi-armed bandit problem. We develop a\nsolution to each problem and provide theoretical and numerical evaluations. In\ncontrast to the state-of-the-art research, the proposed approach is especially\nsuitable for networks with time-variant statistical properties. Moreover, it is\napplicable and operates well even when no initial information about the\nstatistical characteristics of the random parameters such as file popularity\nand channel quality is available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 09:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}
