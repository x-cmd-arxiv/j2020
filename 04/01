A good augmentation produces\nan augmented dataset that adds variability while retaining the statistical\nproperties of the original dataset. Some techniques, such as AutoAugment and\nFast AutoAugment, have introduced a search phase to find a set of suitable\naugmentation policies for a given model and dataset. This comes at the cost of\ngreat computational overhead, adding up to several thousand GPU hours. More\nrecently RandAugment was proposed to substantially speedup the search phase by\napproximating the search space by a couple of hyperparameters, but still\nincurring non-negligible cost for tuning those. In this paper we show that,\nunder the assumption that the augmentation space is approximately distribution\ninvariant, a uniform sampling over the continuous space of augmentation\ntransformations is sufficient to train highly effective models. Based on that\nresult we propose UniformAugment, an automated data augmentation approach that\ncompletely avoids a search phase. In addition to discussing the theoretical\nunderpinning supporting our approach, we also use the standard datasets, as\nwell as established models for image classification, to show that\nUniformAugment's effectiveness is comparable to the aforementioned methods,\nwhile still being highly efficient by virtue of not requiring any search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 16:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

In this\nrespect, black holes (BHs) are natural configurations to explore the quantum\neffects on strong gravitational fields.

We wish to avoid the implement of\nthe determinant function in many variables, and rather work with these compact\nspaces by means of fibrations and covering maps. The important fibrations are\ndeletion of the final vector from the frame, and selection of the first vector.\nThe long homotopy sequence for this fibration implies that the equivalence\nclasses of loops form the group of two elements. One generator of this group is\na circle of Givens rotations. Dimension three is critical for the proof. It is\nhandled by the Rodrigues formula, together with Invariance of Domain. Another\nexplicit proof that the mapping from unit quaternions is surjective to the main\npath-component is due to Itzhack. Thus the Orthogonal Group is not path\nconnected, using the Homotopy Lifting Theorem for coverings. But the Givens\nloop performs an identity lifting, so it cannot be the group generator. As an\napplication we review how quoted algorithms from the astronautical literature,\nrelated to the Wahba guidance problem, give rise to an orthogonalization of any\nmatrix that is metrically close to some rotation. This method has a bias in the\nFrobenius norm, but under realistic conditions serves as well as a Procrustean\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 16:43:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 11:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

These advancements were facilitated by computational tools\nenabling the analysis of large-scale data-sets of digital traces. One of the\nchallenges when pre-processing spatial trajectories is the so-called stop\nlocation detection, that entails the reduction of raw time series to sequences\nof destinations where an individual was stationary. The most widely adopted\nsolution to this problem was proposed by Hariharan and Toyama (2004) and\ninvolves filtering out non-stationary measurements, then applying agglomerative\nclustering on the stationary points. This state-of-the-art solution, however,\nsuffers of two limitations: (i) frequently visited places located very close\n(such as adjacent buildings) are likely to be merged into a unique location,\ndue to inherent measurement noise, (ii) traces for multiple users can not be\nanalysed simultaneously, thus the definition of destination is not shared\nacross users.

In particular, DATESSO consists of a re\nned formulation that differentiates the \"strictness\" for latency/utilization\nconstraints in two levels.

Since mergers are the principal drivers\nof disc-to-spheroid morphological transformation, and the most massive galaxies\ntypically have the richest merger histories, it is surprising that discs exist\nat all at the highest stellar masses (e.g. beyond the knee of the mass\nfunction). Using Horizon-AGN, a cosmological hydro-dynamical simulation, we\nshow that extremely massive (M*> 10^11.4 MSun) discs are created via two\nchannels. In the primary channel (accounting for ~70% of these systems and ~8%\nof massive galaxies) the most recent, significant merger (stellar mass ratio >\n1:10) between a massive spheroid and a gas-rich satellite `spins up' the\nspheroid by creating a new rotational stellar component, leaving a massive disc\nas the remnant. In the secondary channel (accounting for ~30% of these systems\nand ~3% of massive galaxies), a system maintains a disc throughout its\nlifetime, due to an anomalously quiet merger history. Not unexpectedly, the\nfraction of massive discs is larger at higher redshift, due to the Universe\nbeing more gas-rich. The morphological mix of galaxies at the highest stellar\nmasses is, therefore, a strong function of the gas fraction of the Universe.\nFinally, these massive discs have similar black-hole masses and accretion rates\nto massive spheroids, providing a natural explanation for why a minority of\npowerful AGN are surprisingly found in disc galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Optical vortices are a large family of\nfields, being Laguerre-Gaussian only one particular case. Now we extend the\nstudy of the applicability of the paraxial approximation to a broader set of\noptical vortices by considering the interaction of atoms with generalized\nLaguerre-Gaussian and generalized Bessel beams. We demonstrate that all vortex\nbeams here considered look the same close to the beam axis, where the atom is\nplaced. From this, we conclude that the paraxial approximation fails for the\nlarge set of vortex beams, and that a full understanding of the interaction of\noptical vortices with atoms requires the inclusion of all vector components of\nthe electric field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 18:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-02"}

We argue\nthat the path to developing artificial human-like-intelligence will pass\nthrough mimicking the evolutionary process in a nature-like simulation. In\nNature, there are two processes driving the development of the brain: evolution\nand learning. Evolution acts slowly, across generations, and amongst other\nthings, it defines what agents learn by changing their internal reward\nfunction. Learning acts fast, across one's lifetime, and it quickly updates\nagents' policy to maximise pleasure and minimise pain. The reward function is\nslowly aligned with the fitness function by evolution, however, as agents\nevolve the environment and its fitness function also change, increasing the\nmisalignment between reward and fitness. It is extremely computationally\nexpensive to replicate these two processes in simulation. This work proposes\nEvolution via Evolutionary Reward (EvER) that allows learning to\nsingle-handedly drive the search for policies with increasingly evolutionary\nfitness by ensuring the alignment of the reward function with the fitness\nfunction. In this search, EvER makes use of the whole state-action trajectories\nthat agents go through their lifetime. In contrast, current evolutionary\nalgorithms discard this information and consequently limit their potential\nefficiency at tackling sequential decision problems. We test our algorithm in\ntwo simple bio-inspired environments and show its superiority at generating\nmore capable agents at surviving and reproducing their genes when compared with\na state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 18:16:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 16:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-07"}

As\na result, the reconstructed image cannot well support semantic editing through\nvarying the inverted code. To solve this problem, we propose an in-domain GAN\ninversion approach, which not only faithfully reconstructs the input image but\nalso ensures the inverted code to be semantically meaningful for editing. We\nfirst learn a novel domain-guided encoder to project a given image to the\nnative latent space of GANs.

Integrated information theory (IIT) (Oizumi et al.,\n2014) offers a quantitative account of causation based on a set of causal\nprinciples, including notions such as causal specificity, composition, and\nirreducibility, that challenges the reductionist perspective in multiple ways.\nFirst, the IIT formalism provides a complete account of a system's causal\nstructure, including irreducible higher-order mechanisms constituted of\nmultiple system elements. Second, a system's amount of integrated information\n($\\Phi$) measures the causal constraints a system exerts onto itself and can\npeak at a macro level of description (Hoel et al., 2016; Marshall et al.,\n2018).

This novel approach comprises a segmentator that\nuses a set of graph convolution layers to enable parcellation directly across\nbrain surfaces in a source domain, and a discriminator that predicts a graph\ndomain from segmentations. More precisely, the proposed adversarial network\nlearns to generalize a parcellation across both, source and target domains. We\ndemonstrate an 8% mean improvement in performance over a non-adversarial\ntraining strategy applied on multiple target domains extracted from MindBoggle,\nthe largest publicly available manually-labeled brain surface dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 19:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-02"}

Hydrogen-assisted cracking behavior was found\nto be strongly linked to strain-induced martensitic transformation. In\naddition, the amount of alpha' martensite was much higher in the CA sample than\nin other samples, suggesting that severe hydrogen embrittlement can be\ncorrelated with the low mechanical stability of austenite. Detailed\nmicrostructural characterization showed that low austenite stability of the CA\nsample was mainly attributed to the retained content of delta ferrite and the\nchemical inhomogeneity inside the gamma matrix (gamma close to delta has ~2\nwt.% higher Cr but ~2 wt.% lower Ni), but TMT enhanced the chemical homogeneity\nand thus austenite stability. By contrast, the LPBF process led directly, i.e.\nwithout any thermomechanical treatment, to a fully austenitic structure with\nhomogeneous elemental distribution in the ASS. These results confirmed that the\npresence of delta and the chemical inhomogeneity inside gamma matrix, which\npromoted the deformation-induced martensitic transformation and the associated\nH enrichment at the gamma-alpha' interface, was the primary reason for the\nsevere H-assisted failure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 20:07:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-02"}

However, the large magnetization ($\\sim$ a few tesla) in conventional\nquantum anomalous Hall system, makes it challenging to induce\nsuperconductivity. Here, we report two different emergent quantum Hall effects\nin HgTe quantum wells dilutely alloyed with Mn. Firstly, a novel quantum Hall\nstate emerges from the quantum spin Hall state at an exceptionally low magnetic\nfield of $\\sim 50$ mT. Secondly, tuning towards the bulk $p$-regime, we resolve\nmultiple quantum Hall plateaus at fields as low as $20 - 30$ mT, where\ntransport is dominated by a van Hove singularity in the valence band. These\nemergent quantum Hall phenomena rely critically on the topological band\nstructure of HgTe and their occurrence at very low fields make them an ideal\ncandidate for interfacing with superconductors to realize chiral Majorana\nfermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 20:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-29"}

In recent times, various\ndynamic boundary conditions have been introduced to model interactions of the\nmaterials with the boundary more precisely. To take long-range interactions of\nthe materials into account, we propose a new model consisting of a nonlocal\nCahn--Hilliard equation subject to a nonlocal dynamic boundary condition that\nis also of Cahn--Hilliard type and contains an additional boundary penalization\nterm. We rigorously derive our model as the gradient flow of a nonlocal total\nfree energy with respect to a suitable inner product of order $H^{-1}$ which\ncontains both bulk and surface contributions. The total free energy is\nconsidered as nonlocal since it comprises convolutions in the bulk and on the\nsurface of the phase-field variables with certain interaction kernels. The main\ndifficulties arise from defining a suitable kernel on the surface and from\nhandling the resulting boundary convolution. In the main model, the chemical\npotentials in the bulk and on the surface are coupled by a Robin type boundary\ncondition depending on a specific relaxation parameter related to the rate of\nchemical reactions. We prove weak and strong well-posedness of this system, and\nwe investigate the singular limits attained when the relaxation parameter tends\nto zero or infinity. By this approach, we also obtain weak and strong\nwell-posedness of the corresponding limit systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 20:31:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2021 16:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

The\nrates of skyrmion collapse and escape through the boundary of a track, as well\nas the binding to and collapse at a non-magnetic impurity, are calculated as a\nfunction of applied magnetic field. The activation energy for skyrmion\nannihilation is the same in AFMs and corresponding FMs in the absence of an\napplied magnetic field. The pre-exponential factor in the Arrhenius rate law\nis, however, different because skyrmion dynamics is different in the two\nsystems. An applied magnetic field has opposite effects on skyrmions in the two\ntypes of materials. In AFMs the rate of collapse of skyrmions as well as the\nrate of escape through the edge of a magnetic strip decreases slightly with\nincreasing field, while these rates increase strongly for a skyrmion in the\ncorresponding FMs when the field is directed antiparallel to the magnetization\nin the center of the skyrmion. A non-magnetic impurity is less likely to trap a\nskyrmion in AFMs especially in the presence of a magnetic field. This, together\nwith the established fact that a spin polarized current moves skyrmions in AFMs\nin the direction of the current, while in FMs skyrmions move at an angle to the\ncurrent, demonstrates that skyrmions in AFMs have several advantageous\nproperties over skyrmions in FMs for memory and spintronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 20:35:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 07:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

For\nthe dust component, we considered the dust coagulation, fragmentation, momentum\nexchange with the gas, and dust self-gravity. We found that the micron-sized\ndust particles grow rapidly in the circumstellar disk, reaching a few cm in\nsize in the inner 100 au of the disk during less than 100 kyr after the disk\nformation, provided that fragmentation velocity is $30\\rm~ms^{-1}$.

Homoclinic snaking is well understood in the context of simpler\npattern forming systems such as the one-dimensional Swift-Hohenberg equation\nwith cubic-quintic nonlinearity, whose solutions remarkably well resemble the\nsnaking solutions of plane Couette flow. We study the structural stability of\nthe characteristic snakes-and-ladders structure associated with homoclinic\nsnaking for flow modifications that break symmetries of plane Couette flow. We\ndemonstrate that wall-normal suction modifies the bifurcation structure of\nthree-dimensional plane Couette solutions in the same way, a symmetry-breaking\nquadratic term modifies solutions of the one-dimensional Swift-Hohenberg\nequation. These modifications are related to the breaking of the discrete\nrotational symmetry. At large amplitudes of the symmetry-breaking wall-normal\nsuction the connected snakes-and-ladders structure is destroyed. Previously\nunknown solution branches are created and can be parametrically continued to\nvanishing suction. This yields new localised solutions of plane Couette flow\nthat exist in a wide range of Reynolds number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 21:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

We describe a new tunable indexing\nsubsystem for GDBMSs, we call A+ indexes, with materialized view support. The\nsubsystem consists of two types of indexes: (i) vertex-partitioned indexes that\npartition 1-hop materialized views into adjacency lists on either the source or\ndestination vertex IDs; and (ii) edge-partitioned indexes that partition 2-hop\nviews into adjacency lists on one of the edge IDs. As in existing GDBMSs, a\nsystem by default requires one forward and one backward vertex-partitioned\nindex, which we call the primary A+ index. Users can tune the primary index or\nsecondary indexes by adding nested partitioning and sorting criteria. Our\nsecondary indexes are space-efficient and use a technique we call offset lists.\nOur indexing subsystem allows a wider range of applications to benefit from\nGDBMSs' fast join capabilities.

Some methods choose to transform the point cloud data into\ncompact tensors first and leverage off-the-shelf 2D detectors to propose 3D\nobjects, which is much faster and achieves state-of-the-art results.

The huge volume of users and their behaviors in\nAnt Financial requires the ability to process industrial-scale data and perform\nmodel training efficiently. The second challenges is the cold-start problem.\nDifferent from the manual review for credit card application in conventional\nbanks, the credit limit of Ant Credit Pay is automatically offered to users\nbased on the knowledge learned from big data.

Setting seismic imaging into a Bayesian framework allows for a\nprincipled way of studying uncertainty by solving for the model posterior\ndistribution. Imaging, however, typically constitutes only the first stage of a\nsequential workflow, and UQ becomes even more relevant when applied to\nsubsequent tasks that are highly sensitive to the inversion outcome. In this\npaper, we focus on how UQ trickles down to horizon tracking for the\ndetermination of stratigraphic models and investigate its sensitivity with\nrespect to the imaging result. As such, the main contribution of this work\nconsists in a data-guided approach to horizon tracking uncertainty analysis.\nThis work is fundamentally based on a special reparameterization of\nreflectivity, known as \"deep prior\". Feasible models are restricted to the\noutput of a convolutional neural network with a fixed input, while weights and\nbiases are Gaussian random variables. Given a deep prior model, the network\nparameters are sampled from the posterior distribution via a Markov chain Monte\nCarlo method, from which the conditional mean and point-wise standard deviation\nof the inferred reflectivities are approximated. For each sample of the\nposterior distribution, a reflectivity is generated, and the horizons are\ntracked automatically. In this way, uncertainty on model parameters naturally\ntranslates to horizon tracking. As part of the validation for the proposed\napproach, we verified that the estimated confidence intervals for the horizon\ntracking coincide with geologically complex regions, such as faults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 04:26:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2020 22:56:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 22:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-16"}

This is because the associated increase in planetary albedo enables\nstable climates closer to the star, where rapid destabilization can be\ntriggered from a lower mean surface temperature. Enhanced longwave emission for\nplanets with very high stratospheric temperatures also permits stable climates\nat smaller orbital distances.

Among all layers in CNNs, convolution layers are the\nmost computation-intensive and consume the most energy. As the maturity of\ndevice and fabrication technology, 3D resistive random access memory (ReRAM)\nreceives substantial attention for accelerating large vector-matrix\nmultiplication and convolution due to its high parallelism and energy\nefficiency benefits. However, implementing multi-channel convolution naively in\n3D ReRAM will either produce incorrect results or exploit only partial\nparallelism of 3D ReRAM. In this paper, we propose a 3D ReRAM-based convolution\naccelerator architecture, which efficiently maps multi-channel convolution to\nmonolithic 3D ReRAM. Our design has two key principles. First, we exploit the\nintertwined structure of 3D ReRAM to implement multi-channel convolution by\nusing a state-of-the-art convolution algorithm. Second, we propose a new\napproach to efficiently implement negative weights by separating them from\nnon-negative weights using configurable interconnects.

However, two drawbacks\nstill exist. One is that word embeddings are pre-trained by unidirectional\nlanguage modeling objectives. Thus the word embeddings only contain\nleft-to-right context information. The other is that POS tags are provided by\nan external POS tagger. So computation cost will be increased and incorrect\npredicted tags may affect the performance of restoring punctuation marks during\ndecoding. This paper proposes adversarial transfer learning to address these\nproblems. A pre-trained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers\n(BERT) model is used to initialize a punctuation model. Thus the transferred\nmodel parameters carry both left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\nFurthermore, adversarial multi-task learning is introduced to learn task\ninvariant knowledge for punctuation prediction. We use an extra POS tagging\ntask to help the training of the punctuation predicting task. Adversarial\ntraining is utilized to prevent the shared parameters from containing task\nspecific information. We only use the punctuation predicting task to restore\nmarks during decoding stage. Therefore, it will not need extra computation and\nnot introduce incorrect tags from the POS tagger. Experiments are conducted on\nIWSLT2011 datasets.

Here,\nwe analyze the acceleration noises that are caused by the magnetic field of\nspace plasma for the test mass of TianQin. The real solar wind data observed by\nthe Advanced Composition Explorer are taken as the input of the\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulation. The Space Weather Modeling Framework is used to\nsimulate the global magnetosphere of the earth, from which we obtain the plasma\nand magnetic field parameters on the detector's orbits. We calculate the time\nseries of the residual accelerations and the corresponding amplitude spectral\ndensities on these orbit configurations. We find that the residual acceleration\nproduced by the interaction between the TM's magnetic moment induced by the\nspace magnetic field and the spacecraft magnetic field ($\\bm{a}_{\\rm M1}$) is\nthe dominant term, which can approach $10^{-15}$ m/s$^2$/Hz$^{1/2}$ at $f\n\\approx$ 0.2 mHz for the nominal values of the magnetic susceptibility\n($\\chi_{\\rm m} = 10^{-5}$) and the magnetic shielding factor ($\\xi_{\\rm m} =\n10$) of the test mass. The ratios between the amplitude spectral density of the\nacceleration noise caused by the space magnetic field and the preliminary goal\nof the inertial sensor are 0.38 and 0.08 at 1 mHz and 10 mHz, respectively. We\ndiscuss the further reduction of this acceleration noise by decreasing\n$\\chi_{\\rm m}$ and/or increasing $\\xi_{\\rm m}$ in the future instrumentation\ndevelopment for TianQin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 06:48:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 13:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

They have different\nworking conditions: For example, partners show good performance in a large\npopulation, whereas rivals do in head-to-head matches.

The key challenge lies in how to learn correspondence between image\nand text. Existing works learn coarse correspondence based on object\nco-occurrence statistics, while failing to learn fine-grained phrase\ncorrespondence. In this paper, we present a novel Graph Structured Matching\nNetwork (GSMN) to learn fine-grained correspondence. The GSMN explicitly models\nobject, relation and attribute as a structured phrase, which not only allows to\nlearn correspondence of object, relation and attribute separately, but also\nbenefits to learn fine-grained correspondence of structured phrase. This is\nachieved by node-level matching and structure-level matching. The node-level\nmatching associates each node with its relevant nodes from another modality,\nwhere the node can be object, relation or attribute. The associated nodes then\njointly infer fine-grained correspondence by fusing neighborhood associations\nat structure-level matching.

We focus on both the steady state and\nrelaxation dynamics of the model. The bare model with annealed noise on finite\n$2D$ lattice, in the stationary state, exhibits a crossover from\nsynchronization to desynchronization as noise strength varies. Finite-size\nscaling (FSS) analysis reveals that, in the thermodynamic limit, this crossover\nbecomes a true phase transition, which is Kosterlitz-Thouless ($KT$)-type\nanalogous to that of $2D$ $XY$ model. On the other hand, when the noise is\nquenched, it does not show any kind of synchronization-desynchronization phase\ntransition in the thermodynamic limit. But we do observe a crossover from low\nnoise-strength synchronization to high noise-strength desynchronization in\nfinite lattices. We analyze the crossover phenomena through the linear\nstability of the stationary state solutions and obtain the crossover\nnoise-strength from the onset of local instability of the unsynchronized one.\nThe relaxation dynamics also differs for these two types of noise. In case of\nannealed noise, the system, in the critically ordered phase, exhibits algebraic\nrelaxation which is described by the phenomenological Edwards-Wilkinson (EW)\nmodel of growing surface, yielding the same dynamic exponent $z =2$. In\ndisordered phase, the system shows an exponential decay. On the contrary, the\nsystem with quenched noise, as opposed to the annealed one, always relaxes to\nthe stationary state exponentially. Both the system-size and noise-strength\ndependency of the average relaxation time in the synchronized regime are also\ninvestigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 08:58:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-02"}

To overcome these\nlimitations Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) methods seek to automate, with\nfew or no human-intervention, the design of pipelines, i.e., automate the\nselection of the sequence of methods that have to be applied to the raw data.\nThese methods have the potential to enable non-expert users to use ML, and\nprovide expert users with solutions that they would unlikely consider. In\nparticular, this paper describes AutoML-DSGE - a novel grammar-based framework\nthat adapts Dynamic Structured Grammatical Evolution (DSGE) to the evolution of\nScikit-Learn classification pipelines. The experimental results include\ncomparing AutoML-DSGE to another grammar-based AutoML framework, Resilient\nClassificationPipeline Evolution (RECIPE), and show that the average\nperformance of the classification pipelines generated by AutoML-DSGE is always\nsuperior to the average performance of RECIPE; the differences are\nstatistically significant in 3 out of the 10 used datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 09:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-02"}

To investigate the specific irradiation damage\nof 1 MeV electron irradiation in GaInAsP lattice matched to InP for varying In\nand P contents, a simulation based analysis is employed: by fitting the quantum\nefficiency and open-circuit voltage simultaneously before and after\nirradiation, the induced changes in lifetime are detected.

It holds a key to understand the origin of many exotic quantum\nphenomena, for example the mechanism of extremely large magnetoresistance (MR)\nin topological Dirac/Weyl semimetals. Here, we report studies of the\nangle-dependent MR (ADMR) and the thermoelectric effect in W2As3 single\ncrystal. The compound shows a large unsaturated MR (of about 70000% at 4.2 K\nand 53 T). The most striking finding is that the ADMR significantly deforms\nfrom the horizontal dumbbell-like shape above 40 K to the vertical lotus-like\npattern below 30 K. The window of 30-40 K also corresponds substantial changes\nin Hall effect, thermopower and Nernst coefficient, implying an abrupt change\nof Fermi surface topology. Such a temperature-induced Lifshitz transition\nresults in a compensation of electron-hole transport and the large MR as well.\nWe thus suggest that the similar method can be applicable in detecting a\nFermi-surface change of a variety of quantum states when a direct Fermi-surface\nmeasurement is not possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 09:49:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-02"}

However, the appropriate parameter\nsetting generally depends on the structure of the optimisation problem, which\nis often unknown to the user. Non-deterministic parameter control mechanisms\nadjust parameters using information obtained from the evolutionary process.\nSelf-adaptation -- where parameter settings are encoded in the chromosomes of\nindividuals and evolve through mutation and crossover -- is a popular parameter\ncontrol mechanism in evolutionary strategies. However, there is little\ntheoretical evidence that self-adaptation is effective, and self-adaptation has\nlargely been ignored by the discrete evolutionary computation community.\n  Here we show through a theoretical runtime analysis that a non-elitist,\ndiscrete evolutionary algorithm which self-adapts its mutation rate not only\noutperforms EAs which use static mutation rates on \\leadingones, but also\nimproves asymptotically on an EA using a state-of-the-art control mechanism.\nThe structure of this problem depends on a parameter $k$, which is \\emph{a\npriori} unknown to the algorithm, and which is needed to appropriately set a\nfixed mutation rate. The self-adaptive EA achieves the same asymptotic runtime\nas if this parameter was known to the algorithm beforehand, which is an\nasymptotic speedup for this problem compared to all other EAs previously\nstudied. An experimental study of how the mutation-rates evolve show that they\nrespond adequately to a diverse range of problem structures.\n  These results suggest that self-adaptation should be adopted more broadly as\na parameter control mechanism in discrete, non-elitist evolutionary algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 10:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-02"}

The protocol guarantees that only the latest channel state can be\nconfirmed on channel closure. LN nodes gossip about channels available for\nrouting and their total capacities. To issue a (multi-hop) payment, the sender\ncreates a route based on its local knowledge of the graph. As local channel\nbalances are not public, payments often fail due to insufficient balance at an\nintermediary hop. In that case, the payment is attempted along multiple routes\nuntil it succeeds. This constitutes a privacy-efficiency tradeoff: hidden\nbalances improve privacy but hinder routing efficiency. In this work, we show\nthat an attacker can easily discover channel balances using probing. This takes\nunder a minute per channel and requires moderate capital commitment and no\nexpenditures. We describe the algorithm and test our proof-of-concept\nimplementation on Bitcoin's testnet. We argue that LN's balance between privacy\nand routing efficiency is suboptimal: channel balances are neither well\nprotected nor utilized. We outline two ways for LN to evolve in respect to this\nissue. To emphasize privacy, we propose a modification of error handling that\nhides details of the erring channel from the sending node. This would break our\nprobing technique but make routing failures more common, as the sender would\nnot know which channel from the attempted route has failed. To improve\nefficiency, we propose a new API call that would let the sender query balances\nof channels that it is not a party of. We argue that combining these approaches\ncan help LN take the best of both worlds: hide private data when feasible, and\nutilize public data for higher routing efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 10:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-02"}

This ability is also known as grounded image captioning.\nHowever, the grounding accuracy of existing captioners is far from\nsatisfactory. To improve the grounding accuracy while retaining the captioning\nquality, it is expensive to collect the word-region alignment as strong\nsupervision. To this end, we propose a Part-of-Speech (POS) enhanced image-text\nmatching model (SCAN \\cite{lee2018stacked}): POS-SCAN, as the effective\nknowledge distillation for more grounded image captioning.

During training, the network has only access to\ndata of one task at a time, where each task contains several classes. In this\nsetting, networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting which refers to the\ndrastic drop in performance on previous tasks. The vast majority of methods\nhave studied this scenario for classification networks, where for each new task\nthe classification layer of the network must be augmented with additional\nweights to make room for the newly added classes. Embedding networks have the\nadvantage that new classes can be naturally included into the network without\nadding new weights. Therefore, we study incremental learning for embedding\nnetworks. In addition, we propose a new method to estimate the drift, called\nsemantic drift, of features and compensate for it without the need of any\nexemplars. We approximate the drift of previous tasks based on the drift that\nis experienced by current task data. We perform experiments on fine-grained\ndatasets, CIFAR100 and ImageNet-Subset.

Firstly, we generate a set\nof short tubelet proposals containing the object in $N$ consecutive frames.\nThen, we aggregate RoI pooled deep features through the tubelet using a\ntemporal pooling operator that summarizes the information with a fixed size\noutput independent of the number of input frames. On top of that, we define a\ndouble head implementation that we feed with spatio-temporal aggregated\ninformation for spatio-temporal object classification, and with spatial\ninformation extracted from the current frame for object localization and\nspatial classification. Furthermore, we also specialize each head branch\narchitecture to better perform in each task taking into account the input data.\nFinally, a long-term linking method builds long tubes using the previously\ncalculated short tubelets to overcome detection errors.

Bandpass correction is typically performed by\ncomparing measurements of a strong calibrator source to an assumed model,\ntypically an isolated point source. The wide field-of-view and high sensitivity\nof modern interferometers means that additional sources are often detected in\nobservations of calibrators. This can introduce errors into bandpass\ncorrections and subsequently the target data if not properly accounted for.\nFocusing on the standard calibrator PKS B1934-638, we perform simulations to\nasses this effect by constructing a wide-field sky model.

In contrast, most work in this\nsetting considers only one of the above abilities. In this study, we develop an\narchitecture that allows for communication among agents and tailors the\nsystem's reward for each individual agent. Our architecture represents agent\ncommunication through graph convolution and applies an existing credit\nassignment structure, counterfactual multi-agent policy gradient (COMA), to\nassist agents to learn communication by back-propagation. The flexibility of\nthe graph structure enables our method to be applicable to a variety of\nmulti-agent systems, e.g. dynamic systems that consist of varying numbers of\nagents and static systems with a fixed number of agents. We evaluate our method\non a range of tasks, demonstrating the advantage of marrying communication with\ncredit assignment.

Researchers have proposed two pragmatic techniques to tackle this\nproblem. The first approach consists of reducing the queries to algebraic\nexpressions and proving their equivalence using an algebraic theory. The\nlimitations of this technique are threefold. It cannot prove the equivalence of\nqueries with significant differences in the attributes of their relational\noperators. It does not support certain widely-used SQL features. Its\nverification procedure is computationally intensive. The second approach\ntransforms this problem to a constraint satisfaction problem and leverages a\ngeneral-purpose solver to determine query equivalence. This technique consists\nof deriving the symbolic representation of the queries and proving their\nequivalence by determining the query containment relationship between the\nsymbolic expressions. While the latter approach addresses all the limitations\nof the former technique, it only proves the equivalence of queries under set\nsemantics. However, in practice, database applications use bag semantics. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel symbolic approach for proving query\nequivalence under bag semantics. We transform the problem of proving query\nequivalence under bag semantics to that of proving the existence of a\nbijective, identity map between tuples returned by the queries on all valid\ninputs.

Since ballistic\ntunnel of spin-polarized electrons sensitively depends on the chemical\ncomposition and the atomic geometry of the lead/barrier interfaces their proper\ndesign is a key issue for achieving the required functionality of the devices\nsuch as e.g. a high tunnel magneto resistance. An important leap in the\ndevelopment of novel spintronic devices is to replace the insulating barrier by\na ferroelectric which adds new additional functionality induced by the\npolarization direction in the barrier giving rise to the tunnel electro\nresistance (TER). The multiferroic tunnel junction\nCo/PbZr$_{0.2}$Ti$_{0.8}$O$_{3}$/La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ (Co/PZT/LSMO)\nrepresents an archetype system for which - despite intense studies - no\nconsensus exists for the interface geometry and their effect on transport\nproperties. Here we provide the first analysis of the Co/PZT interface at the\natomic scale using complementary techniques, namely x-ray diffraction and\nextended x-ray absorption fine structure in combination with x-ray magnetic\ncircular dichroism and ab-initio calculations. The Co/PZT interface consists of\none perovskite-type cobalt oxide unit cell [CoO$_{2}$/CoO/Ti(Zr)O$_{2}$] on\nwhich a locally ordered cobalt film grows.

With very limited\ncommunication resources, it is beneficial to schedule the most informative\nlocal learning updates. In this paper, a novel scheduling policy is proposed to\nexploit both diversity in multiuser channels and diversity in the \"importance\"\nof the edge devices' learning updates. First, a new probabilistic scheduling\nframework is developed to yield unbiased update aggregation in FEEL. The\nimportance of a local learning update is measured by its gradient divergence.\nIf one edge device is scheduled in each communication round, the scheduling\npolicy is derived in closed form to achieve the optimal trade-off between\nchannel quality and update importance. The probabilistic scheduling framework\nis then extended to allow scheduling multiple edge devices in each\ncommunication round.

Quenching crystals from the growth temperature has\nbeen previously shown to produce a metastable state that undergoes a strongly\nhysteretic first-order transition upon cooling below ~100K. The first-order\ntransition impacts the magnetic properties, yielding an enhancement in the\nCurie temperature T_C from 270 to 310K. In the present work, T_HT ~550K has\nbeen identified as the temperature above which metastable crystals are obtained\nvia quenching. Diffraction experiments reveal a structural change at this\ntemperature, and significant stacking disorder occurs when samples are slowly\ncooled through this temperature range. The transport properties are\ndemonstrated to be similar regardless of the crystal's thermal history. The\nscattering of charge carriers appears to be dominated by moments fluctuating on\nthe Fe(1) sublattice, which remain dynamic down to 100-120K. Maxima in the\nmagnetoresistance and anomalous Hall resistance are observed near 120K. The\nHall and Seebeck coefficients are also impacted by magnetic ordering on the\nFe(1) sublattice. The data suggest that both electrons and holes contribute to\nconduction above 120K, but that electrons dominate at lower temperature when\nall of the Fe sublattices are magnetically ordered.

It is challenging to satisfy required quality of\nservice (QoS) levels for flows within aircraft due to the large number of users\nand the highly varying air to ground (A2G) link capacities composed of\nsatellite and direct air to ground communication (DA2GC). To represent service\nquality variations, we propose models for the generated traffic flows from\naircraft and variations in A2G links. We present three different forwarding\nschemes based on priority, delay requirements and history of the dropped flows\nmetrics. Forwarding schemes schedule the flows in real time by choosing either\nsatellite or direct air to ground link depending on the delay and capacity\nrequirements of flows to maximize the number of accepted flows with required\nQoS guarantees in terms of dropped packets and delay. Also, the effect of local\ncaching is studied to fully satisfy the QoS requirement of flows in simulated\nflights.

Furthermore, at least 0.9 cache hit rate is\nrequired to satisfy all flows for at least 50% of simulated flights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 15:15:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-02"}

The model is reviewed here and the relevant functions\nhave been written in a form suitable for a Monte Carlo implementation. Two main\nvariants of the model for pseudoscalar meson production are formulated and both\nof them have been implemented in stand alone Monte Carlo programs.

In practice, collecting a sufficient amount of expert\ndemonstrations can be prohibitively expensive, and the quality of\ndemonstrations typically limits the performance of the learning policy.

The root cause of the challenge lies in the nondeterministic\nnature of blockchains: A $n$-party transaction across multiple blockchains\nmight be partially rolled back due to the potential forks in any of the\nparticipating blockchains---eventually, only one fork will survive in the\ncompetition among miners. While some effort has recently been made to\ndeveloping hierarchically distributed commit protocols to make multi-party\ntransactions progress, there is no systematic method to reason about the\ntransaction outcome. This paper tackles this problem from a perspective of\npoint-set topology. We construct multiple topological spaces for the\ntransactions and blockchain forks, and show that these spaces are internally\nrelated through either homeomorphism or continuous functions. Combined\ntogether, these tools allow us to reason about the cross-blockchain\ntransactions through the growing-fork topology, an intuitive representation of\nblockchains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 03:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 19:07:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 00:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

To gain benefit from approximate memory for realistic applications,\nit is crucial to partition applications' data to approximate data and critical\ndata and apply different error rates. However, error rates cannot be controlled\nin a fine-grained manner (e.g., per byte) due to fundamental limitations of how\napproximate memory can be realized. Due to this, if approximate data and\ncritical data are interleaved in a data structure (e.g., a C struct that has a\npointer and an approximatable number as its members), data partitioning may\ndegrade the application's performance because the data structure must be split\nto separate memory regions that have different error rates. This paper is the\nfirst to conduct an analysis of realistic C/C++ code to assess the impact of\nthis problem. First, we find the type of data (e.g., \"int\", \"struct point\")\nthat is assessed by the instruction that incurs the largest number of cache\nmisses in a benchmark, which we refer to as the target data type. Second, we\nqualitatively estimate if the target data type of an application has\napproximate data and critical data interleaved. To this end, we set up three\ncriteria to analyze it because definitively distinguishing a piece of data as\napproximate data or critical data is infeasible since it depends on each\nuse-case. We analyze 11 memory intensive benchmarks from SPEC CPU 2006 and 2\ngraph analytics frameworks, and show that the target data types of 9 benchmarks\nare either a C struct or a C++ class (criterion 1). Among them, two have a\npointer and a non-pointer member together (criterion 2) and three have a\nfloating point number and other members together (criterion 3).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 02:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-06"}

Subsequently, the proposed method was applied to the capsule endoscope\nimaging workstation. After screening out similar images in the complete data\ngathered by the Type I OMOM Small Intestinal Capsule Endoscope from 52 cases\ncovering 17 common types of small intestinal lesions, we obtained a lesion\nrecall of 100% and an average similar image reduction ratio of 76%.

One of the possibilities for the\nteam, to reach this aim, is to see what its neighbours are doing. This approach\ngenerates a rules system governing the movement of the single robot just by\nreference to neighbour's motion. The same approach is used in position based\ndynamics to simulate behaviour of complex continuum materials under\ndeformation. Therefore, in some previous works, we have considered a\ntwo-dimensional lattice of particles and calculated its time evolution by using\na rules system derived from our experience in swarm robotics. The new position\nof a particle, like the element of a swarm, is determined by the spatial\nposition of the other particles. No dynamic is considered, but it can be\nthought as being hidden in the behaviour rules. This method has given good\nresults in some simple situations reproducing the behaviour of deformable\nbodies under imposed strain. In this paper we try to stress our model to\nhighlight its limits and how they can be improved. Some other, more complex,\nexamples are computed and discussed.

Rather, an abstraction of the data in\nthe form of a machine learning model update is sent. Recent studies showed that\nsuch model updates may still very well leak private information and thus more\nstructured risk assessment is needed.

The root cause of this cell loss\nin PD is still not decisively elucidated. A recent line of thinking traces the\ncause of PD neurodegeneration to metabolic deficiency. Due to exceptionally\nhigh energy demand, SNc neurons exhibit a higher basal metabolic rate and\nhigher oxygen consumption rate, which results in oxidative stress. Recently, we\nhave suggested that the excitotoxic loss of SNc cells might be due to energy\ndeficiency occurring at different levels of neural hierarchy. Levodopa (LDOPA),\na precursor of dopamine, which is used as a symptom-relieving treatment for PD,\nleads to outcomes that are both positive and negative. Several researchers\nsuggested that LDOPA might be harmful to SNc cells due to oxidative stress. The\nrole of LDOPA in the course of PD pathogenesis is still debatable. We\nhypothesize that energy deficiency can lead to LDOPA-induced toxicity (LIT) in\ntwo ways: by promoting dopamine-induced oxidative stress and by exacerbating\nexcitotoxicity in SNc. We present a multiscale computational model of\nSNc-striatum system, which will help us in understanding the mechanism behind\nneurodegeneration postulated above and provides insights for developing\ndisease-modifying therapeutics. It was observed that SNc terminals are more\nvulnerable to energy deficiency than SNc somas. During LDOPA therapy, it was\nobserved that higher LDOPA dosage results in increased loss of somas and\nterminals in SNc. It was also observed that co-administration of LDOPA and\nglutathione (antioxidant) evades LDOPA-induced toxicity in SNc neurons. We show\nthat our proposed model was able to capture LDOPA-induced toxicity in SNc,\ncaused by energy deficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 11:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

Quantifying the economic cost of local businesses after\nextreme shocks is important for post-disaster assessment and pre-disaster\nplanning. Conventionally, surveys have been the primary source of data used to\nquantify damages inflicted on businesses by disasters. However, surveys often\nsuffer from high cost and long time for implementation, spatio-temporal\nsparsity in observations, and limitations in scalability. Recently, large scale\nhuman mobility data (e.g. mobile phone GPS) have been used to observe and\nanalyze human mobility patterns in an unprecedented spatio-temporal granularity\nand scale. In this work, we use location data collected from mobile phones to\nestimate and analyze the causal impact of hurricanes on business performance.\nTo quantify the causal impact of the disaster, we use a Bayesian structural\ntime series model to predict the counterfactual performances of affected\nbusinesses (what if the disaster did not occur?), which may use performances of\nother businesses outside the disaster areas as covariates. The method is tested\nto quantify the resilience of 635 businesses across 9 categories in Puerto Rico\nafter Hurricane Maria.
