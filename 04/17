We also study the effect\nof wind clumping and CNO-processed abundances on the observed spectra. Clumpy\nwinds tend to produce stronger UV emission and absorption lines, because\nclumping increases both the emission measure and the abundances of the relevant\nionic species, the latter by reducing the ionization state of the outflow.

However, recent progress in coupling\nphotons to material quasiparticles (e.g., plasmons, phonons, and excitons)\nforces us to generalize the way we picture the photon at the core of every\nlight-matter interaction.

A new family\nof discriminant explanations is introduced. These produce heatmaps that\nattribute high scores to image regions informative of a classifier prediction\nbut not of a counter class. They connect attributive explanations, which are\nbased on a single heat map, to counterfactual explanations, which account for\nboth predicted class and counter class. The latter are shown to be computable\nby combination of two discriminant explanations, with reversed class pairs. It\nis argued that self-awareness, namely the ability to produce classification\nconfidence scores, is important for the computation of discriminant\nexplanations, which seek to identify regions where it is easy to discriminate\nbetween prediction and counter class. This suggests the computation of\ndiscriminant explanations by the combination of three attribution maps.

We present a novel\ndynamical mechanism that can explain the origin of these instabilities and thus\nthe dearth of resonant systems in the exoplanet sample. It relies on the\nemergence of secondary resonances between a fraction of the synodic frequency\n$2 \\pi (1/P_1-1/P_2)$ and the libration frequencies in the mean motion\nresonance. These secondary resonances excite the amplitudes of libration of the\nmean motion resonances thus leading to an instability. We detail the emergence\nof these secondary resonances by carrying out an explicit perturbative scheme\nto second order in the planetary masses and isolating the harmonic terms that\nare associated with them. Focusing on the case of three planets in the 3:2 --\n3:2 mean motion resonance as an example, a simple but general analytical model\nof one of these resonances is obtained which describes the initial phase of the\nactivation of one such secondary resonance. The dynamics of the excited system\nis also briefly described. This scheme shows how one can obtain analytical\ninsight into the emergence of these resonances, and into the dynamics that they\ntrigger. Finally, a generalisation of this dynamical mechanism is obtained for\narbitrary $N$ and $k$. This leads to an explanation of previous numerical\nexperiments on the stability of resonant chains, showing why the critical\nplanetary mass allowed for stability decreases with increasing $N$ and $k$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 17:34:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

To evaluate our stochastic model of service, we apply it to an\nindustry contact center dataset containing nearly 5 million messages.

The validity of using a particular simulator to draw accurate\nconclusions relies on the assumption that the computer code is correctly\ncalibrated. This calibration procedure is often pursued under extensive\nexperimentation and comparison with data from a real-world process. The problem\nis that the data collection may be so expensive that only a handful of\nexperiments are feasible. History matching is a calibration technique that,\ngiven a simulator, it iteratively discards regions of the input space using an\nimplausibility measure. When the simulator is computationally expensive, an\nemulator is used to explore the input space. In this paper, a Gaussian process\nprovides a complete probabilistic output that is incorporated into the\nimplausibility measure. The identification of regions of interest is\naccomplished with recently developed annealing sampling techniques.

Many of these phenomena are related to the\nformation of a hot and dense state of deconfined quarks and gluons known as the\nquark gluon plasma (QGP). Chief among these are the observed near inviscid\nhydrodynamic expansion of the QGP, as measured through azimuthal anisotropy\ncoefficients of low-$p_\\mathrm{T}$ final state hadrons $v_\\mathrm{n}$, and the\nloss of energy of high-$p_\\mathrm{T}$ color charges as they traverse the QGP\nwhich is observed as a quenching of strongly-interacting final state objects\nlike jets. Observations of these phenomena in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions at\nRHIC and the LHC provide compelling evidence of QGP formation. Small collision\nsystems, like $p$+Pb, also show evidence for the creation droplets of QGP\nthrough the observation of anisotropic flow; however, these systems show no\nsigns of the energy loss observed in large collision systems. Thus, small\nsystems are an ideal venue to explore the relationship between high- and\nlow-$p_\\mathrm{T}$ QGP phenomena. Furthermore, the low ambient energy of $p$+Pb\ncompared to A+A collisions allow for the precise determination of perturbative\nprocess rates which can be used to understand the nuclear modification of\nnucleon parton densities.\n  This dissertation explores $p$+Pb data collected with the ATLAS detector at\nthe LHC. The cross section and nuclear modification factor for prompt, isolated\nphotons are measured and compared to predictions from perturbative QCD\ncalculations and a model of initial state energy loss.

In spite of\nthe many propositions to explain this wide range of emission, it still lacks\none that reproduces all the observations. Filling this gap, we present a model\nto reproduce the quiescent spectral energy distribution of 4U 0142+61 from\nmid-infrared up to hard X-rays using plausible physical components and\nparameters. We propose that the persistent emission comes from a magnetic\naccreting white dwarf (WD) surrounded by a debris disk. This model assumes\nthat: (i) the hard X-rays are due to the bremsstrahlung emission from the\npost-shock region of the accretion column; (ii) the soft X-rays are originated\nby hot spots on the WD surface; and (iii) the optical and infrared emissions\nare caused by an optically thick dusty disk, the WD photosphere, and the tail\nof the postshock region emission. In this scenario, the fitted model parameters\nindicate that 4U 0142+61 harbors a fast-rotator magnetic near-Chandrasekhar WD,\nwhich is very hot and hence young. Such a WD can be the recent outcome of a\nmerger of two less massive WDs.

They involve finding a certain kind of\nspectral decomposition to obtain basis functions that can capture important\nstructures for the problem at hand. The most common spectral method is the\nprincipal component analysis (PCA). It utilizes the top eigenvectors of the\ndata covariance matrix, e.g. to carry out dimensionality reduction. This data\npre-processing step is often effective in separating signal from noise. PCA and\nother spectral techniques applied to matrices have several limitations. By\nlimiting to only pairwise moments, they are effectively making a Gaussian\napproximation on the underlying data and fail on data with hidden variables\nwhich lead to non-Gaussianity. However, in most data sets, there are latent\neffects that cannot be directly observed, e.g., topics in a document corpus, or\nunderlying causes of a disease. By extending the spectral decomposition methods\nto higher order moments, we demonstrate the ability to learn a wide range of\nlatent variable models efficiently. Higher-order moments can be represented by\ntensors, and intuitively, they can encode more information than just pairwise\nmoment matrices. More crucially, tensor decomposition can pick up latent\neffects that are missed by matrix methods, e.g. uniquely identify\nnon-orthogonal components. Exploiting these aspects turns out to be fruitful\nfor provable unsupervised learning of a wide range of latent variable models.\nWe also outline the computational techniques to design efficient tensor\ndecomposition methods. We introduce Tensorly, which has a simple python\ninterface for expressing tensor operations. It has a flexible back-end system\nsupporting NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow and MXNet amongst others, allowing\nmulti-GPU and CPU operations and seamless integration with deep-learning\nfunctionalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 22:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

By\ncorrecting for the background biased by the background parametrizations in the\npresence of axion signals, we realized a signal to noise ratio efficiency of\nabout 100\\%. Given the axion haloscope search analyses to date, the scanning\nrate can be improved by 21\\%, with about a 10\\% improvement in the signal to\nnoise ratio. This improvement is another low cost innovation in axion haloscope\nsearches, where all the experimental parameters are currently at their best.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 00:53:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 07:48:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 00:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Recently, deep-learning-based traffic\nforecasting methods have emerged as state of the art for a wide range of\ntraffic forecasting tasks. However, these methods require a large amount of\ntraining data, which needs to be collected over a significant period of time.\nThis can present a number of challenges for the development and deployment of\ndata-driven learning methods for highway networks that suffer from lack of\nhistorical data. A promising approach to address this issue is transfer\nlearning, where a model trained on one part of the highway network can be\nadapted for a different part of the highway network. We focus on diffusion\nconvolutional recurrent neural network (DCRNN), a state-of-the-art graph neural\nnetwork for highway network forecasting. It models the complex spatial and\ntemporal dynamics of the highway network using a graph-based diffusion\nconvolution operation within a recurrent neural network. DCRNN cannot perform\ntransfer learning, however, because it learns location-specific traffic\npatterns, which cannot be used for unseen regions of the network. To that end,\nwe develop a new transfer learning approach for DCRNN, where a single model\ntrained on data-rich regions of the highway network can be used to forecast\ntraffic on unseen regions of the highway network. We evaluate the ability of\nour approach to forecast the traffic on the entire California highway network\nwith one year of time series data. We show that TL-DCRNN can learn from several\nregions of the California highway network and forecast the traffic on the\nunseen regions of the network with high accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrate that\nTL-DCRNN can learn from San Francisco region traffic data and can forecast\ntraffic on the Los Angeles region and vice versa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 02:29:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 13:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

A shared\ncommunication channel is a multiple access channel, which consists of a\nsequence of synchronized time slots. Players on the channel may attempt to\nbroadcast a packet (message) in any time slot. A player's broadcast succeeds if\nno other player broadcasts during that slot. If two or more players broadcast\nin the same time slot, then the broadcasts collide and both broadcasts fail.\nThe lack of collision detection means that a player monitoring the channel\ncannot differentiate between the case of two or more players broadcasting in\nthe same slot (a collision) and zero players broadcasting. In the\ncontention-resolution problem, players arrive on the channel over time, and\neach player has one packet to transmit. The goal is to coordinate the players\nso that each player is able to successfully transmit its packet within\nreasonable time. However, the players can only communicate via the shared\nchannel by choosing to either broadcast or not. A contention-resolution\nprotocol is measured in terms of its throughput (channel utilization). Previous\nwork on contention resolution that achieved constant throughput assumed that\neither players could detect collisions, or the players' arrival pattern is\ngenerated by a memoryless (non-adversarial) process. The foundational question\nanswered by this paper is whether collision detection is a luxury or necessity\nwhen the objective is to achieve constant throughput. We show that even without\ncollision detection, one can solve contention resolution, achieving constant\nthroughput, with high probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 02:33:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 12:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

Considering the\ntopology structure of human body, we propose a trainable graph reasoning method\nthat establishes internal structural connections between graph nodes to correct\ntwo typical errors in the pseudo-labels, i.e., the global structural error and\nthe local consistency error. For the global error, we first transform\ncategory-wise features into a high-level graph model with coarse-grained\nstructural information, and then decouple the high-level graph to reconstruct\nthe category features. The reconstructed features have a stronger ability to\nrepresent the topology structure of the human body. Enlarging the receptive\nfield of features can effectively reducing the local error. We first project\nfeature pixels into a local graph model to capture pixel-wise relations in a\nhierarchical graph manner, then reverse the relation information back to the\npixels. With the global structural and local consistency modules, these errors\nare rectified and confident pseudo-labels are generated for retraining.\nExtensive experiments on the LIP and the ATR datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our global and local rectification modules.

The objective is to minimize\nthe average response time of an MD that consists of communication time, waiting\ntime and processing time. M/G/1 queueing models are established for MDs and\nMEC-ss.

However, the calculation cost becomes enormous as the size\nof the models becomes larger. Various techniques for compressing the size of\nthe models have been proposed to improve performance while reducing\ncomputational costs. One of the methods to compress the size of the models is\nknowledge distillation (KD). Knowledge distillation is a technique for\ntransferring knowledge of deep or ensemble models with many parameters (teacher\nmodel) to smaller shallow models (student model). Since the purpose of\nknowledge distillation is to increase the similarity between the teacher model\nand the student model, we propose to introduce the concept of metric learning\ninto knowledge distillation to make the student model closer to the teacher\nmodel using pairs or triplets of the training samples. In metric learning, the\nresearchers are developing the methods to build a model that can increase the\nsimilarity of outputs for similar samples. Metric learning aims at reducing the\ndistance between similar and increasing the distance between dissimilar. The\nfunctionality of the metric learning to reduce the differences between similar\noutputs can be used for the knowledge distillation to reduce the differences\nbetween the outputs of the teacher model and the student model. Since the\noutputs of the teacher model for different objects are usually different, the\nstudent model needs to distinguish them. We think that metric learning can\nclarify the difference between the different outputs, and the performance of\nthe student model could be improved. We have performed experiments to compare\nthe proposed method with state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 08:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

In this paper,\nwe propose a novel approach towards ground-terrain recognition via modeling the\nExtent-of-Texture information to establish a balance between the order-less\ntexture component and ordered-spatial information locally. At first, the\nproposed method uses a CNN backbone feature extractor network to capture\nmeaningful information of a ground terrain image, and model the extent of\ntexture and shape information locally. Then, the order-less texture information\nand ordered shape information are encoded in a patch-wise manner, which is\nutilized by intra-domain message passing module to make every patch aware of\neach other for rich feature learning. Next, the Extent-of-Texture (EoT) Guided\nInter-domain Message Passing module combines the extent of texture and shape\ninformation with the encoded texture and shape information in a patch-wise\nfashion for sharing knowledge to balance out the order-less texture information\nwith ordered shape information. Further, Bilinear model generates a pairwise\ncorrelation between the order-less texture information and ordered shape\ninformation.

In addition, it is found that\nthe characteristics of the reflectance spectrum and subsequently the spectral\nposition of PBG and defect mode are entirely independent on changes in the\nstarting radius of the hollow core. This characteristic is very attractive to\nmanufacturers, since increasing the size of the core radius would offer\nflexibility and simplicity of fabrication in producing optical devices. This\nstudy reveals that the optical reflectance of defective APCs is strongly\ndependent on azimuthal mode number. Therefore, our designed defective APC\nstructure works as a perfect reflector for the considerable range of wavelength\nfor higher azimuthal mode numbers. Lastly, our results show that by increase\nthe temperature of superconductor layer both of the existed band gaps and\ndefect mode show a red-shift trend by moving towards higher wavelengths. The\nproposed structure and related results can lead to gain valuable information\nfor designing and fabrication of new types of annular Bragg resonators\nsurrounding a radial defect and integrated visible waveguide devices like\noptical switches and filters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 10:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

The work reported\nrepresents a further development of the structure-preserving geometric PIC\nalgorithm [1-12], achieving the goal of practical applications in magnetic\nfusion research. The algorithm is constructed by discretizing the field theory\nfor the system of charged particles and electromagnetic field using Whitney\nforms, discrete exterior calculus, and explicit non-canonical symplectic\nintegration. In addition to the truncated infinitely dimensional symplectic\nstructure, the algorithm preserves exactly many important physical symmetries\nand conservation laws, such as local energy conservation, gauge symmetry and\nthe corresponding local charge conservation. As a result, the algorithm\npossesses the long-term accuracy and fidelity required for\nfirst-principles-based simulations of the multiscale tokamak physics. The\nalgorithm has been implemented in the SymPIC code, which is designed for\nhigh-efficiency massively-parallel PIC simulations in modern clusters. The code\nhas been applied to carry out whole-device 6D kinetic simulation studies of\ntokamak physics. A self-consistent kinetic steady state for fusion plasma in\nthe tokamak geometry is numerically found with a predominately diagonal and\nanisotropic pressure tensor.

Meanwhile, the interacted object in\n3D is also not fully studied in HOI learning. In light of these, we propose a\ndetailed 2D-3D joint representation learning method.

The expected ubiquity\nof NVM has stimulated interest in the design of novel concepts ensuring\ncorrectness of concurrent programming abstractions in the face of persistency.\nSo far, this has lead to the design of a number of persistent concurrent data\nstructures, built to satisfy an associated notion of correctness: durable\nlinearizability.\n  In this paper, we transfer the principle of durable concurrent correctness to\nthe area of software transactional memory (STM). Software transactional memory\nalgorithms allow for concurrent access to shared state. Like linearizability\nfor concurrent data structures, opacity is the established notion of\ncorrectness for STMs. First, we provide a novel definition of durable opacity\nextending opacity to handle crashes and recovery in the context of NVM. Second,\nwe develop a durably opaque version of an existing STM algorithm, namely the\nTransactional Mutex Lock (TML). Third, we design a proof technique for durable\nopacity based on refinement between TML and an operational characterisation of\ndurable opacity by adapting the TMS2 specification. Finally, we apply this\nproof technique to show that the durable version of TML is indeed durably\nopaque.

Many\nresearchers have modeled animals' dispersal studying their behavior under the\nassumptions of some movement strategies pre-determined or affected by some\nexternal factor(s) but none of them have compared the efficiency of different\ndispersal strategies in providing population survival and fitness. We\nhypothesize that 1) successful expansion could result from some evolutionary\nstable strategy (ESS) and 2) such strategy could be based particularly on\ndeferred gain, when animals invest in travel to reach some high-quality habitat\n(\"habitat of dream\"). Using simulation model we compare the ecological success\nof three strategies: i) \"Smart\" - choosing the locally optimal cell; ii)\n\"Random\" - random movement between cells without taking into account the\nquality of the environment; iii) \"Dreamer\" - movements that aims to find \"a\nhabitat of dream\" with quality much higher than that of the initial and\nneighboring cells. The population fitness was measured as survival rate,\ndispersal distance, accumulated energy and quality of settled habitat. The most\ngeneral conclusion is that while survival and wealth of the population is\naffected presumably by overall habitat quality, the dispersal depends mainly on\nthe behavioral strategy.

To enable model\ndevelopment and testing, we also constructed a subjective GAN image quality\ndatabase containing (distorted) GAN images and collected human opinions of\nthem. Our experimental results indicate that our proposed GAN IQA model\ndelivers superior quality predictions on the generative image datasets, as well\nas on traditional image quality datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 13:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

Our objective here is to understand $\\textit{what\ncomplicates Transformer training}$ from both empirical and theoretical\nperspectives. Our analysis reveals that unbalanced gradients are not the root\ncause of the instability of training. Instead, we identify an amplification\neffect that influences training substantially -- for each layer in a\nmulti-layer Transformer model, heavy dependency on its residual branch makes\ntraining unstable, since it amplifies small parameter perturbations (e.g.,\nparameter updates) and results in significant disturbances in the model output.\nYet we observe that a light dependency limits the model potential and leads to\ninferior trained models.

As a remedy, we provide the first work which studies the ability of\ngranular human mobility in describing and predicting crime concentrations at an\nhourly scale. For this purpose, we propose the use of data from location\ntechnology platforms.

Simulations of the motion of microscopic particles\nheld by optical tweezers are often required to explore complex phenomena and to\ninterpret experimental data [6, 7, 8, 9]. For the sake of computational\nefficiency, these simulations usually model the optical tweezers as an harmonic\npotential [10, 11]. However, more physically-accurate optical-scattering models\n[12, 13, 14, 15] are required to accurately model more onerous systems; this is\nespecially true for optical traps generated with complex fields [16, 17, 18,\n19]. Although accurate, these models tend to be prohibitively slow for problems\nwith more than one or two degrees of freedom (DoF) [20], which has limited\ntheir broad adoption. Here, we demonstrate that machine learning permits one to\ncombine the speed of the harmonic model with the accuracy of optical-scattering\nmodels. Specifically, we show that a neural network can be trained to rapidly\nand accurately predict the optical forces acting on a microscopic particle. We\ndemonstrate the utility of this approach on two phenomena that are\nprohibitively slow to accurately simulate otherwise: the escape dynamics of\nswelling microparticles in an optical trap, and the rotation rates of particles\nin a superposition of beams with opposite orbital angular momenta. Thanks to\nits high speed and accuracy, this method can greatly enhance the range of\nphenomena that can be efficiently simulated and studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 14:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

The observables are typically a function of several stimuli resulting\nin multidimensional data sets spanning a range of experimental parameters. As\nan example, a common approach to study ferroelectric switching is to observe\neffects of applied electric field, but switching can also be enacted by\npressure and is influenced by strain fields, material composition, temperature,\ntime, etc. Moreover, the parameters are usually interdependent, so that their\ndecoupling toward univariate measurements or analysis may not be\nstraightforward. On the other hand, both explicit and hidden parameters provide\nan opportunity to gain deeper insight into the measured properties, provided\nthere exists a well-defined path to capture and analyze such data.

Furthermore, we demonstrate how the new data representation\nreadily fits into a variety of machinelearning methodologies, from unsupervised\nclassification of the origins of hysteretic response via linear clustering\nalgorithms to neural-network-based inference of the sample temperature based on\nthe specific morphology of hysteresis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 14:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

Analysis and recognition of such dance forms are critical\nfor the preservation of cultural heritage.

Computer analysis of\nBharatanatyam, therefore, requires a structural analysis of Sollukattus. In\nthis paper, we use speech processing techniques to recognize bols.

The problem is\ncomplex because of the lack of annotated data for the different semantic\nregions to segment, thus discouraging the use of strongly supervised\napproaches. We, therefore, propose a weakly supervised and efficient\ninteractive segmentation method to solve this challenging problem.

Here, we use geodesic\ndistances since voxel features as well as spatial relationship among voxels is\nincorporated in this measure. Next, we refine the solution using a GrabCut\nbased segmentation together with a tracking method on the slices of the scan\nthat assigns labels to different regions in the volume, using limited\nsupervision in the form of scribbles drawn by the user. The efficiency of the\nproposed method is demonstrated using visualizations and validated through\nquantitative measures and qualitative unwrapping of the mummy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 14:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

Quarkyonic matter is an approach in which both quarks and nucleons\nappear as quasi-particles in a crossover transition, and provides an explicit\nrealization of early ideas concerning quark matter (e.g., the MIT bag model).\nThis description has recently been employed by McLerran and Reddy to model\nchargeless (pure neutron) matter with an approach that has the virtue that the\nspeed of sound rises quickly at a neutron-quark transition so as to satisfy\nobservational constraints on the neutron star maximum mass ($\\gtrsim2M_\\odot$)\nand the radius of a $1.4M_\\odot$ star ($R_{1.4}\\lesssim 13.5$ km). Traditional\nmodels involving first-order transitions result in softer pressure-energy\ndensity relations that have difficulty satisfying these constraints except with\nvery narrow choices of parameters. We propose a variation of quarkyonic matter\ninvolving protons and leptons whose energy can be explicitly minimized to\nachieve both chemical and beta equilibrium, which cannot be done in the\nchargeless formulation. Quarkyonic stellar models are able to satisfy observed\nmass and radius constraints with a wide range of model parameters, avoiding the\nobligatory fine-tuning of conventional hybrid star models, including requiring\nthe transition density to be very close to the nuclear saturation density. Our\nformulation fits experimental and theoretical properties of the nuclear\nsymmetry energy and pure neutron matter, and contains as few as three free\nparameters.

The action presents quadratic and quartic terms in\nderivatives of the Skyrme fields, but instead of the group indices being\ncontracted by the SU(2) Killing form, they are contracted with the h-matrix in\nthe quadratic term, and by its inverse on the quartic term.

We study cascading dynamics in modular,\ndegree-heterogeneous networks, and consider the impact of intra-module seeding\nstrategy on inter-module spread. Specifically, we establish that although\nactivating the highest-degree nodes is more effective than random selection at\ngrowing a cascade locally, there is a critical level of inter-module\nconnectivity required for a cascade to cross from one module to another,\nirrespective of the seeding strategy. We present an analytical proof of this\nstatement for the case that each module has the same degree distribution and\nall module pairs have the same inter-module connectivity, while our simulation\nresults suggest its validity for more general situations, including a ring of\nmodules.

Unlike deep learning, meta-learning can be applied to few-shot\nhigh-dimensional datasets and considers further improving model generalization\nto unseen tasks. Deep learning is focused upon in-sample prediction and\nmeta-learning concerns model adaptation for out-of-sample prediction.\nMeta-learning can continually perform self-improvement to achieve highly\nautonomous AI. Meta-learning may serve as an additional generalization block\ncomplementary for original deep learning model. Meta-learning seeks adaptation\nof machine learning models to unseen tasks which are vastly different from\ntrained tasks. Meta-learning with coevolution between agent and environment\nprovides solutions for complex tasks unsolvable by training from scratch.\nMeta-learning methodology covers a wide range of great minds and thoughts. We\nbriefly introduce meta-learning methodologies in the following categories:\nblack-box meta-learning, metric-based meta-learning, layered meta-learning and\nBayesian meta-learning framework. Recent applications concentrate upon the\nintegration of meta-learning with other machine learning framework to provide\nfeasible integrated problem solutions.

The beam plasmon excitations are shown to have both wave and\nparticle character, de Broglie wavenumbers of which depend on various\nparameters such as average beam speed, the chemical potential, the charge\nscreening and the background electrostatic energy. The deterministic single\nelectron dynamics in the beam is investigated using the dual-wavelength\nelectrostatic potential energy. It is shown that electrons can be either\ntrapped or traveling along the beam direction depending on the ambient plasma\nparameter values. The problem of monochromatic beam transport through binary as\nwell as ternary metallic configurations are investigated and some technological\napplications of these system are pointed out.
