Currently, there are limited event-based datasets due to the\ntroublesome annotation of the asynchronous event stream. Annotating large scale\nvision dataset often takes lots of computation resources, especially the\ntroublesome data for video-level annotation.

That seems to be the case of Abell 1644, a nearby galaxy\ncluster, composed of three main structures: the southern cluster that exhibits\na spiral-like morphology, A1644S; the northern cluster seen in X-ray\nobservations, A1644N1; and the recently discovered substructure, A1644N2. By\nmeans of $N$-body hydrodynamical simulations, we attempt to reconstruct the\ndynamical history of this system. These simulations resulted in two specific\nscenarios: (i) The collision between A1644S and A1644N2. Our best model has an\ninclination between the merger plane and the plane of the sky of $30^\\circ$,\nand reaches the best morphology $1.6\\,$Gyr after the pericentric passage. At\nthis instant A1644N2 is gas poor, becoming nearly undetectable in X-ray\nemission. This model shows a good agreement with observations; (ii) The\ncollision between A1644S and A1644N1. This approach did not give rise to\nresults as satisfactory as the first scenario, due to great disturbances in\ndensity and mismatching temperature maps. As a complementary study, we perform\na three-cluster simulation using as base the best-fitting model to reproduce\nthe current state of A1644 with the three main structures. This scenario\npresented a good agreement to the global morphology of the observations. Thus,\nwe find that the more likely scenario is a collision between A1644S and the\nnewly discovered A1644N2, where A1644N1 may be present as long as it does not\ngreatly interfere in the formation of the spiral feature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 17:05:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 21:18:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

In these complex\narchitectures, a crucial role is played by the Region of Interest (RoI)\nextraction layer, devoted to extracting a coherent subset of features from a\nsingle Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) layer attached on top of a backbone.\n  This paper is motivated by the need to overcome the limitations of existing\nRoI extractors which select only one (the best) layer from FPN. Our intuition\nis that all the layers of FPN retain useful information. Therefore, the\nproposed layer (called Generic RoI Extractor - GRoIE) introduces non-local\nbuilding blocks and attention mechanisms to boost the performance.\n  A comprehensive ablation study at component level is conducted to find the\nbest set of algorithms and parameters for the GRoIE layer. Moreover, GRoIE can\nbe integrated seamlessly with every two-stage architecture for both object\ndetection and instance segmentation tasks. Therefore, the improvements brought\nabout by the use of GRoIE in different state-of-the-art architectures are also\nevaluated. The proposed layer leads up to gain a 1.1% AP improvement on\nbounding box detection and 1.7% AP improvement on instance segmentation.\n  The code is publicly available on GitHub repository at\nhttps://github.com/IMPLabUniPr/mmdetection/tree/groie_dev\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 17:07:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 14:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

For stars with convective envelopes, such as red\ngiants, this leads to an incomplete depiction of the surface layers. As a\nresult, the predicted stellar oscillation frequencies are haunted by systematic\nerrors, the so-called surface effect. Different empirically and theoretically\nmotivated correction relations have been proposed to deal with this issue. In\nthis paper, we compare the performance of these surface correction relations\nfor red giant branch stars. For this purpose, we apply the different surface\ncorrection relations in asteroseismic analyses of eclipsing binaries and open\nclusters. In accordance with previous studies of main-sequence stars, we find\nthat the use of different surface correction relations biases the derived\nglobal stellar properties, including stellar age, mass, and distance estimates.\nWe furthermore demonstrate that the different relations lead to the same\nsystematic errors for two different open clusters. Our results overall\ndiscourage from the use of surface correction relations that rely on reference\nstars to calibrate free parameters. Due to the demonstrated systematic biasing\nof the results, the use of appropriate surface correction relations is\nimperative to any asteroseismic analysis of red giants. Accurate mass, age, and\ndistance estimates for red giants are fundamental when addressing questions\nthat deal with the chemo-dynamical evolution of the Milky Way galaxy. In this\nway, our results also have implications for fields, such as galactic\narchaeology, that draw on findings from stellar physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 17:10:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2020 11:08:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

Unlike with traditional microphone array\nsettings, neither the number of microphones nor their spatial arrangement is\nknown in advance, which hinders the use of conventional multi-channel speech\nseparation neural networks based on fixed size input. To overcome this, a novel\nnetwork architecture is proposed that interleaves inter-channel processing\nlayers and temporal processing layers.

The temporal\nprocessing layers are based on a bidirectional long short term memory (BLSTM)\nmodel and applied to each channel independently. The proposed network leverages\ninformation across time and space by stacking these two kinds of layers\nalternately.

This new interaction is repulsive and competes with\ngravity on large scales and in the dynamics of galaxies and clusters. We focus\non non-linear models of dark electrodynamics where the effects of the new force\nare screened within a K-mouflage radius that helps avoiding traditional\nconstraints on charged dark matter models. We discuss the background cosmology\nof these models in a Newtonian approach and show the equivalence with\nrelativistic Lema\\^itre models where an inhomogeneous pressure due to the\nelectrostatic interaction is present. In particular, we find that dark matter\nshells of different radii evolve differently as they exit their K-mouflage\nradii at different times, resulting in a breaking of the initial comoving\nevolution. In the large time regime, the background cosmology is described by\ncomoving but inhomogeneous model with a reduced gravitational Newton constant\nand a negative curvature originating from the electrostatic pressure. Baryons\ndo not directly feel the electrostatic interaction, but are influenced by the\ninhomogeneous matter distribution induced by the electric force. We find that\nshells of smaller radii evolve faster than the outer shells which feel the\nrepulsive interaction earlier. This mimics the discrepancy between the large\nscale Hubble rate and the local one. Similarly, as galaxies and clusters are\nnot screened by the new interaction, large scale global flows would result from\nthe existence of the new dark electromagnetic interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 17:31:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 16:33:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 08:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Presently,\nferroelectric (FE) perovskite-based photovoltaics are attracting enormous\nattention for environmental stability and better energy conversion efficiency\nthrough enhanced charge separation, owing to loss of center of inversion\nsymmetry. We report on antiferroelectric-ferroelectric (AF-FE) phases of BZS\nthin film, grown with chemical vapor deposition (CVD), using\ntemperature-dependent Raman investigations and first-principles calculations.\nThe origin of FE phases is established from anomalous behavior of A7g ~ 300\ncm-1 and B1g5 ~ 420 cm-1 modes, which involves the vibration of atoms at apical\nsite of ZrS6 octahedra. Additionally, below 60 K, B1g1 and B2g2 ( ~ 85 cm-1)\nmodes appear whereas B12g (~ 60 cm-1) disappears to stabilize the Pnma\nstructure against ferroelectricity by local distortion. Here, B2g2 and B1g2\ninvolve vibrations of Ba atoms in AF manner while B1g1 involves, in addition,\nthe rotation of octahedra as well. Our first-principles calculations confirm\nthat FE appears as a result of loss of center of inversion symmetry in ZrS6\noctahedra due to existence of oxygen (O) impurities placed locally at apical\nsites of sulfur (S) atom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 17:32:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 07:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

Samples with different particle population densities ($p$)\nas well as particle size ratios ($\\lambda$) have been assessed. The initial\npositions of five thousand non-overlapping particles are assigned inside a\nconfining rectangular box.

In fact, even haloes that are typically\nclassified as having quiescent formation histories experience multiple minor\nmergers. These minor mergers drive small deviations from pseudo-evolution,\nwhich cause fluctuations in the concentration parameters and result in\neffectively irreducible scatter in the relation between concentration and\nassembly history. Hence, caution should be taken when using present-day halo\nconcentration parameter as a proxy for the halo assembly history, especially if\nthe recent merger history is unknown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 00:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

In contrast\nto filaments without gravity, the velocity dispersion of self-gravitating\nfilaments does not settle in an equilibrium. Despite showing similar amounts of\ndriven turbulence, they continually dissipate their velocity dispersion until\nthe onset of core formation. This difference is connected to the evolution of\nthe radius as it determines the dissipation rate. In the non-gravitational case\nfilament growth is not limited and its radius grows linearly with time. In\ncontrast, there is a maximum extent in the self-gravitational case resulting in\nan increased dissipation rate. Furthermore, accretion driven turbulence shows a\nradial profile which is anti-correlated with density. This leads to a constant\nturbulent pressure throughout the filament. As the additional turbulent\npressure does not have a radial gradient it does not contribute to the\nstability of filaments and does not increase the critical line-mass. However,\nthis radial turbulence does affect the radius of a filament, adding to the\nextent and setting its maximum value. Moreover, the radius evolution also\naffects the growth timescale of cores which compared to the timescale of\ncollapse of an accreting filament limits core formation to high line-masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

Furthermore, the availability of such data also enhances the\ncollision avoidance systems (CASs) by evaluating driver's actions in near-crash\nscenarios and providing timely warnings. These applications motivate the need\nfor heuristic tools capable of inferring relationship among driving risk,\ndriver/vehicle characteristics, and road environment. In this paper, we\nacquired amount of real-world driving data and built a comprehensive dataset,\nwhich contains multiple \"driver-vehicle-road\" attributes. The proposed method\nworks in two steps. In the first step, a variable precision rough set (VPRS)\nbased classification technique is applied to draw a reduced core subset from\nfield driving dataset, which presents the essential attributes set most\nrelevant to driving safety assessment. In the second step, we design a decision\nstrategy by introducing mutual information entropy to quantify the significance\nof each attribute, then a representative index through accumulation of weighted\n\"driver-vehicle-road\" factors is calculated to reflect the driving risk for\nactual situation. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated in an\noffline analysis of the driving data collected in field trials, where the aim\nis to infer the emergency braking actions in next short term. The results\nindicate that our proposed model is a good alternative for providing improved\nwarnings in real-time because of its high prediction accuracy and stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 18:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-30"}

One approach to\nmitigate stellar activity is to use combined analyses of both radial velocity\nand time-series photometry. We present an analysis of simultaneous\ndisk-integrated photometry and radial velocity data of the Sun in order to\ndetermine the useful limits of a combined analysis. We find that simple\nperiodogram or autocorrelation analysis of solar photometry give the correct\nrotation period <50% of the time. We therefore use a Gaussian process to\ninvestigate the time variability of solar photometry and to directly compare\nsimultaneous photometry with radial velocity data. We find that the\nhyperparameter posteriors are relatively stable over 70 years of solar\nphotometry and the amplitude tracks the solar cycle. We observe good agreement\nbetween the hyperparameter posteriors for the simultaneous photometry and\nradial velocity data. Our primary conclusion is a recommendation to include an\nadditional prior in Gaussian process fits to constrain the evolutionary\ntimescale to be greater than the recurrence timescale (ie., the rotation\nperiod) to recover more physically plausible and useful results.

One\nof the underlying questions is the role of close binarity in this population,\nstanding upon the fact that RGs in short-period binary systems (<150 days or\nso) have been observed to display strong rotational modulation. We select a\nsample of about 4500 relatively bright RGs observed by Kepler, and show that\n370 of them (8%) display rotational modulation. Almost all have oscillation\namplitudes below the median of the sample, while 30 of them are not oscillating\nat all. Of the 85 of these RGs with rotational modulation chosen for follow-up\nradial-velocity observation and analysis, 34 show clear evidence of\nspectroscopic binarity. Surprisingly, 26 of the 30 non-oscillators are in this\ngroup of binaries. To the contrary, about 85% of the active RGs with detectable\noscillations are not part of close binaries. With the help of stellar masses\nand evolutionary states computed from the oscillation properties, it appears\nthat low-mass red-giant branch stars tend to be magnetically inactive, while\nintermediate-mass ones tend to be highly active. The opposite trends are true\nfor helium-core burning (red clump) stars, whereby the lower-mass clump stars\nare comparatively more active and the higher-mass ones less so. In other words,\nwe find that low-mass red-giant branch stars gain angular momentum as they\nevolve to clump stars, while higher-mass ones lose angular momentum. The trend\nobserved with low-mass stars leads to possible scenarios of planet engulfment\nor other merging events during the shell-burning phase. Regarding\nintermediate-mass stars, the rotation periods are long with respect to\ntheoretical expectations reported in the literature, which reinforces the\nexistence of an unidentified sink of angular momentum after the main sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 19:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

We then show it is possible for a large\nclass of quantum states with polynomial creation complexity to have common\ncoefficient features such that given any candidate quantum state we can design\nan efficient coefficient sampling procedure to determine if it belongs to the\nclass or not with arbitrarily high success probability. Consequently partial\nknowledge of a quantum state's creation complexity is obtained, which can be\nuseful for designing quantum circuits and algorithms involving such a state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 21:12:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 20:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

This theory generalizes the classical theory of Morse complexes of smooth\ndynamical systems together with the corresponding cancellation theory for\nnon-degenerate singularities. This is accomplished by defining a GS-chain\ncomplex for $(M,\\varphi)$ and computing its spectral sequence $(E^r,d^r)$. As\n$r$ increases, algebraic cancellations occur, causing modules in $E^r$ to\nbecome trivial. The main theorems herein relate these algebraic cancellations\nwithin the spectral sequence to a family $\\{M_r,\\varphi_r\\}$ of GS-flows\n$\\varphi_r $ on singular surfaces $M_r$, all of which have the same homotopy\ntype as $M$.

Specifically, in\nspin-orbit torque (SOT) devices, a fundamental question arises: how to break\nthe symmetry of the perpendicular magnetic moment by the in-plane spin\npolarization? Here, we show that the chiral symmetry breaking by the DMI can\ninduce the deterministic SOT switching of the perpendicular magnetization. By\nintroducing a gradient of saturation magnetization or magnetic anisotropy,\nnon-collinear spin textures are formed by the gradient of effective SOT\nstrength, and thus the chiral symmetry of the SOT-induced spin textures is\nbroken by the DMI, resulting in the deterministic magnetization switching. We\nintroduce a strategy to induce an out-of-plane (z) gradient of magnetic\nproperties, as a practical solution for the wafer-scale manufacture of SOT\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 22:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-22"}

In a recent breakthrough, Levey and Rothvoss gave a\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, which runs in nearly quasi-polynomial\ntime, for the case when job have unit lengths.

In this study, we contribute Interactive Rainbow Score, an\ninteractive visual system to boost the learning of sight-playing, the general\nmusical skill to read music and map the visual representations to performance\nmotions. The key design of Interactive Rainbow Score is to associate pitches\n(and the corresponding motions) with colored notation and further strengthen\nsuch association via real-time interactions. Quantitative results show that the\ninteractive feature on average increases the learning efficiency by 31.1%.\nFurther analysis indicates that it is critical to apply the interaction in the\nearly period of learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 01:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-30"}

Based on a new thermochemical evolution model of\nprotoplanetary disks, we show that planetesimals with depletion patterns\nsimilar to ordinary and enstatite chondrites can originate at 1-2 AU just\noutside where enstatite evaporates. Around the \"evaporation front\" of\nenstatite, the large inward flow of refractory minerals, including forsterite,\ntakes place with a high pebble concentration, and the loss of those minerals\nresult in depletion in Al, Ca, and Mg. When evaporated solid grains re-condense\nonto pebbles, the concentration of pebbles is further enhanced, potentially\ntriggering the streaming instability. Planetesimals with the composition of\nordinary and enstatite chondrites can thus be naturally created in the\nterrestrial region. The preferential loss of forsterite also creates an\nenhancement of Mg/Si and heavy Si isotopes just inside the potential source\nregion for ordinary and enstatite chondrites.

Our experiments on regression and\nclassification datasets show that NAMs are more accurate than widely used\nintelligible models such as logistic regression and shallow decision trees.\nThey perform similarly to existing state-of-the-art generalized additive models\nin accuracy, but are more flexible because they are based on neural nets\ninstead of boosted trees. To demonstrate this, we show how NAMs can be used for\nmultitask learning on synthetic data and on the COMPAS recidivism data due to\ntheir composability, and demonstrate that the differentiability of NAMs allows\nthem to train more complex interpretable models for COVID-19.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 01:28:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 19:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

As an example, we\npropose an OPO based on Mie-type multipolar resonances, and we demonstrate that\ndue to the low-Q nature of multipolar modes in wavelength-scale resonators,\nthere is a nonlinear interaction between these modes. As a result, the OPO\nthreshold, compared to the single-mode case, can be reduced by a factor that is\nsignificantly larger than the number of interacting modes.

In this paper, the linear system is solved by a\npreconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method where the preconditioner $M$ is\nconstructed by approximating the variable coefficients with a ($T$+1)-term\nLegendre series in each direction to a desired accuracy. A feature of the\nproposed PCG method is that the iteration step increases slightly with the size\nof the resulting matrix when reaching a certain approximation accuracy. The\nefficiency of the method lies in that the system with the preconditioner $M$ is\napproximately solved by a one-step iterative method based on the ILU(0)\nfactorization. The ILU(0) factorization of $M\\in\n\\mathbb{R}^{(N-1)^d\\times(N-1)^d}$ can be computed using $\\mathcal{O}(T^{2d}\nN^d)$ operations, and the number of nonzeros in the factorization factors is of\n$\\mathcal{O}(T^{d} N^d)$, $d=1,2,3$.

One might therefore decide to resort to an approach where individual\nboundary-conforming meshes are pieced together in a modular fashion to form a\nlarger domain. This paper presents a stabilized finite element formulation for\nfluid and temperature equations on sliding meshes. It couples the solution\nfields of multiple subdomains whose boundaries slide along each other on common\ninterfaces. Thus, the method allows to use highly tuned boundary-conforming\nmeshes for each subdomain that are only coupled at the overlapping boundary\ninterfaces. In contrast to standard overlapping or fictitious domain methods\nthe coupling is broken down to few interfaces with reduced geometric dimension.\nThe formulation consists of the following key ingredients: the coupling of the\nsolution fields on the overlapping surfaces is imposed weakly using a\nstabilized version of Nitsche's method.

This work thus makes the\nfirst attempt to tackle those two challenges by extracting substantially\nimportant turns and utilizing external knowledge to enhance the representation\nof context. In this paper, the relevance of each turn to the question are\ncalculated to choose key turns. Besides, terms related to the context and the\nquestion in a knowledge graph are extracted as external knowledge.

Multiple challenges remain in complex scenarios where\na large amount of data needs to be processed in real-time and high degrees of\nsituational awareness are required. The options in this direction are limited\nin existing robotic swarms, mostly homogeneous robots with limited operational\nand reconfiguration flexibility. We address this by bringing elastic computing\ntechniques and dynamic resource management from the edge-cloud computing domain\nto the swarm robotics domain. This enables the dynamic provisioning of\ncollective capabilities in the swarm for different applications. Therefore, we\ntransform a swarm into a distributed sensing and computing platform capable of\ncomplex data processing tasks, which can then be offered as a service.

However, a main challenge limiting the broad use of\ndistributed signal processing techniques is the issue of privacy in handling\nsensitive data. To address this privacy issue, we propose a novel yet general\nsubspace perturbation method for privacy-preserving distributed optimization,\nwhich allows each node to obtain the desired solution while protecting its\nprivate data. In particular, we show that the dual variables introduced in each\ndistributed optimizer will not converge in a certain subspace determined by the\ngraph topology. Additionally, the optimization variable is ensured to converge\nto the desired solution, because it is orthogonal to this non-convergent\nsubspace. We therefore propose to insert noise in the non-convergent subspace\nthrough the dual variable such that the private data are protected, and the\naccuracy of the desired solution is completely unaffected. Moreover, the\nproposed method is shown to be secure under two widely-used adversary models:\npassive and eavesdropping. Furthermore, we consider several distributed\noptimizers such as ADMM and PDMM to demonstrate the general applicability of\nthe proposed method. Finally, we test the performance through a set of\napplications. Numerical tests indicate that the proposed method is superior to\nexisting methods in terms of several parameters like estimated accuracy,\nprivacy level, communication cost and convergence rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 07:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-23"}

The principal idea of the CSGE is to weight\nthe models regarding their observed performance during training on different\naspects. Several extensions are proposed to the original CSGE within this\narticle, making the ensemble even more flexible and powerful. The extended CSGE\n(XCSGE as we term it), is used to predict the power generation on both wind-\nand solar farms. Moreover, the XCSGE is applied to forecast the movement state\nof cyclists in the context of driver assistance systems. Both domains have\ndifferent requirements, are non-trivial problems, and are used to evaluate\nvarious facets of the novel XCSGE. The two problems differ fundamentally in the\nsize of the data sets and the number of features. Power forecasting is based on\nweather forecasts that are subject to fluctuations in their features. In the\nmovement primitive forecasting of cyclists, time delays contribute to the\ndifficulty of the prediction. The XCSGE reaches an improvement of the\nprediction performance of up to 11% for wind power forecasting and 30% for\nsolar power forecasting compared to the worst performing model. For the\nclassification of movement primitives of cyclists, the XCSGE reaches an\nimprovement of up to 28%. The evaluation includes a comparison with other\nstate-of-the-art ensemble methods.

We investigate possible driving mechanisms of volcanic activity on\nrocky super-Earths with masses exceeding 3-4 Mearth. Due to high gravity and\npressures in the mantles of these planets, melting in deep mantle layers can be\nsuppressed, even if the energy releae due to tidal heating and radioactive\ndecay is substantial. Here we investigate whether a newly identified heating\nmechanism, namely induction heating by the star's magnetic field, can drive\nvolcanic activity on these planets due to its unique heating pattern in the\nvery upper part of the mantle. In this region the pressure is not yet high\nenough to preclude the melt formation. Methods. Using the super-Earth HD 3167b\nas an example, we calculate induction heating in the planet's interiors\nassuming an electrical conductivity profile typical of a hot rocky planet and a\nmoderate stellar magnetic field typical of an old inactive star. Then we use a\nmantle convection code (CHIC) to simulate the evolution of volcanic outgassing\nwith time. Results. We show that although in most cases volcanic outgassing on\nHD 3167b is not very significant in the absence of induction heating, including\nthis heating mechanism changes the picture and leads to a substantial increase\nin the outgassing from the planet's mantle.

Specifically, a feature\ngenerator is trained to make only the real faces from different domains\nundistinguishable, but not for the fake ones, thus forming a single-side\nadversarial learning. Moreover, an asymmetric triplet loss is designed to\nconstrain the fake faces of different domains separated while the real ones\naggregated.

We find that when the thermodynamic limit is included\nin an idealized coupled climate/weathering model, steady-state planetary\nclimate loses sensitivity to silicate dissolution kinetics, becoming sensitive\nto temperature primarily through the effect of temperature on runoff and to\npCO$_2$ through an effect on solute concentration mediated by pH. This\nincreases sensitivity to land fraction, CO$_2$ outgassing, and geological\nfactors such as soil age and lithology, all of which are found to have a\nprofound effect on the position of the effective outer edge of the HZ.

In the simulations, the bath is comprised by quasi-hard spheres with\na volume fraction of 50% immersed in a featureless quiescent solvent, and the\ntracer is pulled with a constant small force (within the linear regime). The\ntheoretical analysis is based on the Navier Stokes equation, where a term\nproportional to the velocity arises from coarse-graining the friction of the\ncolloidal particles with the solvent. As a result, the final equation is\nsimilar to the Brinkman model, although the interpretation is different.

Translated\nthrough coronal seismology, increasing sigmoidity results in magnetic field\nestimates which are increasingly shifting towards higher values, and even\nsurpassing the average value for the highest alpha value considered.\nNevertheless, the estimated range of the coronal magnetic field value lies\nwithin the mimimal/maximal limits, proving the robustness coronal seismology.\nWe propose that the discrepancy in the estimations of the absolute value of the\nforce-free magnetic field could be exploited seismologically to determine the\nfree energy of coronal loops, if averages of the internal magnetic field and\ndensity can be reliably estimated by other methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 11:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

The main characteristic of coordinated choices is\nthat they synchronize nondeterministic decision among choices of the same name.\n  The motivation of the synchronization mechanism is to solve a theoretical\nproblem. So, as a practical programming language, we still want to use\ncoordinated choices like standard ones. In other words, we want to avoid\nsynchronization. Now, there are two problems: (i) practically, it is a bit\ncomplicated work to write a program using coordinated choices in which\nexecution synchronization never happens; and (ii) theoretically, it is unknown\nwhether any programs using standard choices can be written by using only\ncoordinated ones.\n  In this paper, we define two simply typed lambda calculi called\n$\\lambda^\\parallel$ equipped with standard choices and\n$\\lambda^{\\parallel\\omega}$ equipped with coordinated choices, and give\ncompilation rules from the former into the latter. The challenge is to show the\ncorrectness of the compilation because behavioral correspondence between\nexpressions before and after compiling cannot be defined directly by the\ncompilation rules. For the challenge, we give an effect system for\n$\\lambda^{\\parallel\\omega}$ that characterizes expressions in which execution\nsynchronization never happens. Then, we show that all compiled expressions can\nbe typed by the effect system. As a result, we can easily show the correctness\nbecause the main concern of the correctness is whether synchronization happens\nor not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 11:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

If the local sources are not sufficient to\nbalance the cluster's load variations, a power request is sent to the\nsupervisory layer, which optimally distributes additional resources available\nfrom the other clusters of the network. To enhance the scalability of the\napproach, the supervisor is implemented relying on a fully distributed\noptimization algorithm. The IEEE 118-bus system is used to test the proposed\ndesign procedure in a non trivial scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 12:17:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-30"}

This allows for example a remote RF generation\nwithout the need for costly high-end electronic circuits and resource sharing.\nHowever, one of the most interesting features of the approach is its inherent\nability to suppress phase noise during the carrier generation process. Besides\nthe comb laser source, the dispersive element is the key component in this\nupconversion scheme. Ideally, it provides the right amount of dispersion over\nthe whole spectral range of the comb. Broader combs are expected to allow a\nhigher degree of phase noise suppression. The simulation of phase noise of an\nRF tone generated by an optical scheme is challenging in terms of computational\nand memory effort. Therefore, a simulation tool taking advantage of the\nproperties of the comb and the Talbot effect had to be developed. In this\npaper, the dependency of the phase noise suppression on the dispersion\ncharacteristic is investigated yielding an important input to the design of\nthese elements. First, the implemented simulation tool and the simulation\nparameters ensuring a correct estimation of the phase noise before and after\ndispersion influence are introduced. Then, the effect of different dispersion\ncharacteristics on the phase noise behavior is analyzed. It could be shown and\nexplained how the phase noise at different offset frequencies to the carrier is\naffected differently depending on the dispersion characteristic and also the\ncomb width.

One of the major issues in deep learning based methodologies\nsuch as in Medical Imaging and other real-world applications is the requirement\nof large annotated datasets prepared by clinicians or experts to train the\nmodel. ZSL is known for having minimal human intervention by relying only on\npreviously known or trained concepts plus currently existing auxiliary\ninformation. This makes the ZSL applicable in many real-world scenarios, from\nunknown object detection in autonomous vehicles to medical imaging and\nunforeseen diseases such as COVID-19 Chest X-Ray (CXR) based diagnosis. We\nintroduce a novel and broaden solution called Few/one-shot learning, and\npresent the definition of the ZSL problem as an extreme case of the few-shot\nlearning. We review over fundamentals and the challenging steps of Zero-Shot\nLearning, including state-of-the-art categories of solutions, as well as our\nrecommended solution, motivations behind each approach, their advantages over\neach category to guide both clinicians and AI researchers to proceed with the\nbest techniques and practices based on their applications. We then review\nthrough different datasets inducing medical and non-medical images, the variety\nof splits, and the evaluation protocols proposed so far. Finally, we discuss\nthe recent applications and future directions of ZSL.

For BPS theories one\ntruncates the full field theory to the moduli space, a finite dimensional\nmanifold of energy minimising field configurations, and studies the quantum\nmechanical problem on this. Non-BPS theories -- the generic case -- have no\nsuch obvious truncation. We define a quantum soliton scattering manifold as a\nconfiguration space which satisfies asymptotic completeness and respects the\nunderlying classical dynamics of slow moving solitons. Having done this, we\npresent a new method to construct such manifolds. In the BPS case the dimension\nof the $n$-soliton moduli space $\\mathcal{M}_n$ is $n$ multiplied by the\ndimension of $\\mathcal{M}_1$. We show that this scaling is not necessarily\nvalid for scattering manifolds in non-BPS theories, and argue that it is false\nfor the Skyrme and baby-Skyrme models. In these models, we show that a relative\nphase difference can generate a relative size difference during a soliton\ncollision. Asymptotically, these are zero and non-zero modes respectively and\nthis new mechanism softens the dichotomy between such modes. Using this\ndiscovery, we then show that all previous truncations of the 2-Skyrmion\nconfiguration space are unsuitable for the quantum scattering problem as they\nhave the wrong dimension. This gives credence to recent numerical work which\nsuggests that the low-energy configuration space is 14-dimensional (rather than\n12-dimensional, as previously thought).

There exist a\nlot of physical theories to predict the BE, each with its own strengths and\nweaknesses. In this paper, we apply Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on AME2016\ndata set to predict the Binding Energy {of atomic nuclei}. The novel feature of\nour work is that it is model independent. We do not assume or use any nuclear\nphysics model but use only ML algorithms directly on the AME2016 data set. Our\nresults are further refined by using another ML algorithm to train the errors\nof the first algorithm, and repeating this process iteratively. Our best\nalgorithm gives $\\sigma_{\\rm rms} \\approx 0.58$ MeV for Binding Energy on\nrandomized testing sets. This is comparable to all physics models or ML\nimproved physics models studied in literature till date.

We present two self-supervised tasks learning over raw text with the\nguidance from knowledge graphs. Building upon entity-level masked language\nmodels, our first contribution is an entity masking scheme that exploits\nrelational knowledge underlying the text. This is fulfilled by using a linked\nknowledge graph to select informative entities and then masking their mentions.\nIn addition we use knowledge graphs to obtain distractors for the masked\nentities, and propose a novel distractor-suppressed ranking objective which is\noptimized jointly with masked language model. In contrast to existing\nparadigms, our approach uses knowledge graphs implicitly, only during\npre-training, to inject language models with structured knowledge via learning\nfrom raw text. It is more efficient than retrieval-based methods that perform\nentity linking and integration during finetuning and inference, and generalizes\nmore effectively than the methods that directly learn from concatenated graph\ntriples.

Since many practical realizations of such\nmaterials involve particulate inclusions of polydisperse size distributions, we\nconcentrate on the effect that mixed particle sizes have on the overall\ndeformational response.

Here we measured the mass\naccretion rate for young stellar objects at age >5 Myr, a critical test for the\ncurrent models of disk evolution. We present the analysis of the spectra of 36\ntargets in the ~5-10 Myr old Upper Scorpius region for which disk masses were\nmeasured with ALMA. We find that the mass accretion rates in this sample of old\nbut still survived disks are similarly high as those of the younger (<3 Myr\nold) star-forming regions of Lupus and Cha I, when considering the dependence\non stellar and disk mass. In particular, several disks show high mass accretion\nrates >10^-9 Msun/yr while having low disk masses. Furthermore, the median\nvalues of the measured mass accretion rates in the disk mass ranges where our\nsample is complete at a level ~60-80% are compatible in these three regions. At\nthe same time, the spread of mass accretion rates at any given disk mass is\nstill >0.9 dex even at age>5 Myr. These results are in contrast with simple\nmodels of viscous evolution, which would predict that the values of the mass\naccretion rate diminish with time, and a tighter correlation with disk mass at\nage>5 Myr. Similarly, simple models of internal photoevaporation cannot\nreproduce the observed mass accretion rates, while external photoevaporation\nmight explain the low disk masses and high accretion rates. A partial possible\nsolution to the discrepancy with the viscous models is that the gas-to-dust\nratio of the disks at >5 Myr is significantly different and higher than the\ncanonical 100, as suggested by some dust and gas disk evolution models. The\nresults shown here require the presence of several inter-playing processes,\nsuch as detailed dust evolution, external photoevaporation and possibly MHD\nwinds, to explain the secular evolution of protoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:33:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 12:13:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 19:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

We note TianQin can possibly detect a few SBBH inspirals\nwith signal to noise ratios greater than 12; lowering the threshold and\ncombining multiple detectors can both boost the detection number. The source\nparameters can be recovered with good precision for most events above the\ndetection threshold. For example, the precision of the merger time most likely\noccurs near 1s, making it possible to guide the detection of the ground-based\ndetectors, the precision of the eccentricity $e_0$ most likely occurs near\n$10^{-4}$, making it possible to distinguish the formation channels, and the\nprecision of the mass parameter is better than $10^{-6}$ in general and most\nlikely occurs near $10^{-7}$.

In this work, we first explain why\ncurrent attention mechanisms in LSTM based encoders can neither provide a\nfaithful nor a plausible explanation of the model's predictions. We observe\nthat in LSTM based encoders the hidden representations at different time-steps\nare very similar to each other (high conicity) and attention weights in these\nsituations do not carry much meaning because even a random permutation of the\nattention weights does not affect the model's predictions.

Different categories of use cases are considered,\nfrom extreme capacity with peak data rates up to 1 Tbps, to raising the typical\ndata rates by orders-of-magnitude, to support broadband connectivity at railway\nspeeds up to 1000 km/h. To achieve these goals, not only the terrestrial\nnetworks will be evolved but they will also be integrated with satellite\nnetworks, all facilitating autonomous systems and various interconnected\nstructures. We believe that several categories of enablers at the\ninfrastructure, spectrum, and protocol/ algorithmic levels are required to\nrealize the intended broadband connectivity goals in 6G. At the infrastructure\nlevel, we consider ultra-massive MIMO technology (possibly implemented using\nholographic radio), intelligent reflecting surfaces, user-centric and scalable\ncell-free networking, integrated access and backhaul, and integrated space and\nterrestrial networks. At the spectrum level, the network must seamlessly\nutilize sub-6 GHz bands for coverage and spatial multiplexing of many devices,\nwhile higher bands will be used for pushing the peak rates of point-to-point\nlinks. The latter path will lead to THz communications complemented by visible\nlight communications in specific scenarios. At the protocol/algorithmic level,\nthe enablers include improved coding, modulation, and waveforms to achieve\nlower latencies, higher reliability, and reduced complexity. Different options\nwill be needed to optimally support different use cases. The resource\nefficiency can be further improved by using various combinations of full-duplex\nradios, interference management based on rate-splitting, machine-learning-based\noptimization, coded caching, and broadcasting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-30"}

In particular, models of the processes driving carbon\nfluxes in high-altitude grasslands and Alpine tundra need to be improved. Here,\nwe propose a comparison of three empirical approaches using systematic\nstatistical analysis, to identify the environmental variables controlling\n$CO_2$ fluxes. The methods were applied to a complete dataset of simultaneous\nin situ measurements of the net $CO_2$ exchange, ecosystem respiration and\nbasic environmental variables in three sampling sites in the same catchment.\nLarge year-to-year variations in the gross primary production (GPP) and\necosystem respiration (ER) dependences on solar irradiance and temperature were\nobserved,. We thus implemented a multi regression model in which additional\nvariables were introduced as perturbations of the standard exponential and\nrectangular hyperbolic functions for ER and GPP, respectively.

The magnetic field in spiral galaxies is known to have a large-scale\nspiral structure along the galactic disk and is observed as X-shaped in the\nhalo of some galaxies. While the disk field can be well explained by dynamo\naction, the 3-dimensional structure of the halo field and its physical nature\nis still unclear.\n  Aims. As first steps towards understanding the halo fields, we want to\nclarify whether the observed X-shaped field is a wide-spread pattern in the\nhalos of spiral galaxies and whether these halo fields are just turbulent\nfields ordered by compression or shear (anisotropic turbulent fields), or have\na large-scale regular structure.\n  Methods. The analysis of the Faraday rotation in the halo is the tool to\ndiscern anisotropic turbulent fields from large-scale magnetic fields. This,\nhowever, has been challenging until recently because of the faint halo emission\nin linear polarization. Our sensitive VLA broadband observations C-band and\nL-band of 35 spiral galaxies seen edge-on (called CHANG-ES) allowed us to\nperform RM-synthesis in their halos and to analyze the results. We further\naccomplished a stacking of the observed polarization maps of 28 CHANG-ES\ngalaxies at C-band.\n  Results. Though the stacked edge-on galaxies were of different Hubble types,\nstar formation and interaction activities, the stacked image clearly reveals an\nX-shaped structure of the apparent magnetic field. We detected a large-scale\n(coherent) halo field in all 16 galaxies that have extended polarized intensity\nin their halos. We detected large-scale field reversals in all of their halos.\nIn six galaxies they are along lines about vertical to the galactic midplane\n(vertical RMTL) with about 2 kpc separation.

RBTS is a kind of point-free theory of space based on the\nnotion of region. Its origin goes back to some ideas of Whitehead, De Laguna\nand Tarski to build the theory of space without the use of the notion of point.\nMore information on RBTS and mereotopology can be found, for instance, in\n\\cite{Vak2007}.

In the\npresent paper, the roles of large-scale magnetic field and outflows in the\nstructure of resistive advection-dominated accretion discs are explored by\nassuming that the accretion flow is radially self-similar. In the non-ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approximation, the results show that the angular\nvelocity is always sub-Keplerian when both the outflow and the large-scale\nmagnetic field are taken into account. A stronger toroidal field component\nleads to faster rotation, while the disc rotates with faster rate if the\nvertical field component is weaker. The increase of magnetic diffusivity causes\nthe infall velocity to be close to Keplerian velocity. Although the previous\nstudies in the ideal MHD approximation have shown that the disc temperature\ndecreases due to the vertical field component, we find that the effect of\nvertical field component on the temperature of a resistive disc depends on the\nmagnetic diffusivity. When the magnetic diffusivity is high, the more efficient\nmechanism for decreasing the disc temperature can be the outflows, and not the\nlarge-scale magnetic field. In such a limit of the magnetic diffusivity, the\ncomponents of the large-scale magnetic field enhance the gas temperature. The\nincrease of temperature can lead to heating and acceleration of the electrons\nand help us to explain the origin of phenomena such as the flares in Sgr A*. On\nthe other hand, the infall velocity in such a limit rises as the temperature\nincreases, and therefore the surface density falls to too low values.

While\ndemonstrations of true quantum supremacy remain rare, quantum computing\napplications managing to exploit the advantages of amplitude amplification have\nshown significant computational benefits when compared against their classical\ncounterparts. We develop a systematic method for designing a quantum circuit to\nrepresent a generic discrete Bayesian network with nodes that may have two or\nmore states, where nodes with more than two states are mapped to multiple\nqubits. The marginal probabilities associated with root nodes (nodes without\nany parent nodes) are represented using rotation gates, and the conditional\nprobability tables associated with non-root nodes are represented using\ncontrolled rotation gates. The controlled rotation gates with more than one\ncontrol qubit are represented using ancilla qubits. The proposed approach is\ndemonstrated for three examples: a 4-node oil company stock prediction, a\n10-node network for liquidity risk assessment, and a 9-node naive Bayes\nclassifier for bankruptcy prediction. The circuits were designed and simulated\nusing Qiskit, a quantum computing platform that enables simulations and also\nhas the capability to run on real quantum hardware. The results were validated\nagainst those obtained from classical Bayesian network implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 04:58:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 15:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

The scientific basis for our inquiry is the\nwell-established fact that disease spread, especially in the initial stages,\nfollows an exponential function meaning few positive cases can explode into a\nwidespread pandemic if the disease is sufficiently transmittable. We define\nprediction bias as the systematic error arising from faulty prediction of the\nnumber of cases x-weeks hence when presented with y-weeks of prior, actual data\non the same. Our design permits us to identify the root of this\nunder-prediction as an EGPB arising from the general tendency to underestimate\nthe speed at which exponential processes unfold.

The bias is\nsignificantly higher for respondents from countries at a later stage relative\nto those at an early stage of disease progression.

However, most\nnavigation methods currently struggle against several challenging problems,\nsuch as data efficiency, automatic obstacle avoidance, and generalization.\nGeneralization problem means that agent does not have the ability to transfer\nnavigation skills learned from previous experience to unseen targets and\nscenes. To address these issues, we incorporate two designs into classic DRL\nframework: attention on 3D knowledge graph (KG) and target skill extension\n(TSE) module. On the one hand, our proposed method combines visual features and\n3D spatial representations to learn navigation policy. On the other hand, TSE\nmodule is used to generate sub-targets which allow agent to learn from\nfailures. Specifically, our 3D spatial relationships are encoded through\nrecently popular graph convolutional network (GCN). Considering the real world\nsettings, our work also considers open action and adds actionable targets into\nconventional navigation situations. Those more difficult settings are applied\nto test whether DRL agent really understand its task, navigating environment,\nand can carry out reasoning. Our experiments, performed in the AI2-THOR, show\nthat our model outperforms the baselines in both SR and SPL metrics, and\nimproves generalization ability across targets and scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 08:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

The proposed\nframework considers various constraints, e.g., recharging time and limited\nbattery to meet delivery deadlines. We propose SDaaS composition algorithms\nusing a modified A* algorithm. A cooperative behavior model is incorporated to\nreduce recharging and waiting time in a delivery. Experimental results prove\nthe efficiency of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 04:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

The\nload and constraints of the non-uniform power CPS coupling network are first\ncharacterized, and can be utilized as a node state judgment standard.\nConsidering the component node isomerism and interdependence between the\ncoupled networks, a power CPS risk regional prediction model based on dependent\nMarkov chain is then constructed. A cross-adaptive gray wolf optimization\nalgorithm improved by adaptive position adjustment strategy and cross-optimal\nsolution strategy is subsequently developed to optimize the prediction model.\nSimulation results using the IEEE 39-BA 110 test system verify the\neffectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 09:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

Motivated by this unprecedented student demand, the CS\nprogram at the University of California, Berkeley has tripled the size of its\ngraduating class in five years. The first two introductory courses for majors,\neach taught by one faculty instructor and several hundred student teachers,\ncombine to serve nearly 2,900 students per term. This report presents three\nstrategies that have enabled the effective teaching, delivery, and management\nof large-scale CS courses: (1) the development of autograder infrastructure and\nonline platforms to provide instant feedback with minimal instructor\nintervention and deliver the course at scale; (2) the expansion of academic and\nsocial student support networks resulting from changes in teaching assistant\nresponsibilities and the development of several near-peer mentoring\ncommunities; and (3) the expansion of undergraduate teacher preparation\nprograms to meet the increased demand for qualified student teachers. These\ninterventions have helped both introductory and advanced courses address\ncapacity challenges and expand enrollments while receiving among the highest\nstudent evaluations of teaching in department history. Implications for\ninclusivity and diversity are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 17:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

This has been done by fabricating a\nsolid target by completely solvent-free mixing of CsI and SnI2 powders and\nisostatic pressing. By controlled laser ablation of the solid target on an\narbitrary substrate at room temperature, the formation of CsSnI3 thin films\nwith optimal optical properties is demonstrated. The films present a band gap\nof 1.32 eV, a sharp absorption edge and near-infrared photoluminescence\nemission. These properties and X-ray diffraction of the thin films confirmed\nthe formation of the orthorhombic (B-$\\gamma$) perovskite phase. The thermal\nstability of the phase was ensured by applying in situ an Al2O$_3$ capping\nlayer. This work demonstrates the potential of pulsed laser deposition as a\nvolatility-insensitive single-source growth technique of halide perovskites and\nrepresents a critical step forward in the development and future scalability of\ninorganic lead-free halide perovskites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 11:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}
