As an example, a company might hire a team for a new project and\nat a later point promote the highest performer on the team. Unlike other\nrepeated classification settings, where the degree of unfairness degrades\ngracefully over multiple fair steps, the degree of unfairness in pipelines can\nbe arbitrary, even in a pipeline with just two stages.\n  Guided by a panoply of real-world examples, we provide a rigorous framework\nfor evaluating different types of fairness guarantees for pipelines.

In this study, we propose a new deep learning model to generate an\noptimized structure for a given design domain and other boundary conditions\nwithout iteration. For this purpose, we used open-source topology optimization\nMATLAB code to generate a pair of optimized structures under various design\nconditions. The resolution of the optimized structure is 32 * 32 pixels, and\nthe design conditions are design area, volume fraction, distribution of\nexternal forces, and load value. Our deep learning model is primarily composed\nof a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based encoder and decoder, trained with\ndatasets generated with MATLAB code. In the encoder, we use batch normalization\n(BN) to increase the stability of the CNN model. In the decoder, we use SPADE\n(spatially adaptive denormalization) to reinforce the design area information.\nComparing the performance of our proposed model with a CNN model that does not\nuse BN and SPADE, values for mean absolute error (MAE), mean compliance error,\nand volume error with the optimized topology structure generated in MAT-LAB\ncode were smaller, and the proposed model was able to represent the design area\nmore precisely. The proposed method generates near-optimal structures\nreflecting the design area in less computational time, compared with the\nopen-source topology optimization MATLAB code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2020 18:54:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2020 13:44:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

Most\ngenerally, the circular polarization will depend on the gravitational-wave\ndirection, and we describe this angular dependence in terms of spherical\nharmonics. While the amplitude of the monopole (the overall chirality of the\ngravitational-wave background) cannot be detected, measures of the anisotropy\nare theoretically conceivable. We provide expressions for the minimum-variance\nestimators for the circular-polarization anisotropy. We evaluate the smallest\ndetectable signal as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio with which the\nisotropic GW signal is detected and the number of pulsars (assumed to be\nroughly uniformly spread throughout the sky) in the survey. We find that the\noverall dipole of the circular polarization and a few higher overall\nmultipoles, are detectable in a survey with $\\gtrsim100$ pulsars if their\namplitude is close to maximal and once the isotropic signal is established with\na signal-to-noise ratio $\\gtrsim400$. Even if the anisotropy can be\nestablished, though, there will be limited information on its direction.\nSimilar arguments apply to astrometric searches for gravitational waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2020 20:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

Therefore, understanding the effects of ART drugs on the CNS\nfunction, especially mental health, can help clinicians personalize medicine\nwith less adverse effects for PWH and prevent them from discontinuing their ART\nto avoid undesirable health outcomes and increased likelihood of HIV\ntransmission. The emergence of electronic health records offers researchers\nunprecedented access to HIV data including individuals' mental health records,\ndrug prescriptions, and clinical information over time. However, modeling such\ndata is very challenging due to high-dimensionality of the drug combination\nspace, the individual heterogeneity, and sparseness of the observed drug\ncombinations.

Unfortunately, IQA is\na typical small sample problem. Therefore, most of the existing DCNN-based IQA\nmetrics operate based on pre-trained networks. However, these pre-trained\nnetworks are not designed for IQA task, leading to generalization problem when\nevaluating different types of distortions. With this motivation, this paper\npresents a no-reference IQA metric based on deep meta-learning. The underlying\nidea is to learn the meta-knowledge shared by human when evaluating the quality\nof images with various distortions, which can then be adapted to unknown\ndistortions easily. Specifically, we first collect a number of NR-IQA tasks for\ndifferent distortions. Then meta-learning is adopted to learn the prior\nknowledge shared by diversified distortions. Finally, the quality prior model\nis fine-tuned on a target NR-IQA task for quickly obtaining the quality model.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed metric outperforms the\nstate-of-the-arts by a large margin.

Insufficient DRAM main\nmemory will incur frequent data swaps between memory and storage, a process\nthat hurts performance, consumes energy and deteriorates the write endurance of\ntypical flash storage devices. Alternately, a larger DRAM has higher leakage\npower and drains the battery faster. Further, DRAM scaling trends make further\ngrowth of DRAMin the mobile space prohibitive due to cost. Emerging\nnon-volatile memory (NVM) has the potential to alleviate these issues due to\nits higher capacity per cost than DRAM and mini-mal static power. Recently, a\nwide spectrum of NVM technologies, including phase-change memories (PCM),\nmemristor, and 3D XPoint have emerged. Despite the mentioned advantages, NVM\nhas longer access latency compared to DRAMand NVM writes can incur higher\nlatencies and wear costs. Therefore integration of these new memory\ntechnologies in the memory hierarchy requires a fundamental rearchitect-ing of\ntraditional system designs. In this work, we propose a hardware-accelerated\nmemory manager (HMMU) that addresses both types of memory in a flat space\naddress space. We design a set of data placement and data migration policies\nwithin this memory manager, such that we may exploit the advantages of each\nmemory technology. By augmenting the system with this HMMU, we reduce the\noverall memory latency while also reducing writes to the NVM. Experimental\nresults show that our design achieves a 39% reduction in energy consumption\nwith only a 12% performance degradation versus an all-DRAM baseline that is\nlikely untenable in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2020 01:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

A common solution is to divide the large aerial image\ninto small (uniform) crops and then apply object detection on each small crop.\nIn this paper, we investigate the image cropping strategy to address these\nchallenges. Specifically, we propose a Density-Map guided object detection\nNetwork (DMNet), which is inspired from the observation that the object density\nmap of an image presents how objects distribute in terms of the pixel intensity\nof the map. As pixel intensity varies, it is able to tell whether a region has\nobjects or not, which in turn provides guidance for cropping images\nstatistically. DMNet has three key components: a density map generation module,\nan image cropping module and an object detector. DMNet generates a density map\nand learns scale information based on density intensities to form cropping\nregions. Extensive experiments show that DMNet achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on two popular aerial image datasets, i.e. VisionDrone and UAVDT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2020 01:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

In\nparticular, the slight nonlinearity during weak arcing processes, the\ndistortion offset caused by the lag of heat dissipations, and the interference\nof background noises could lead to invalid of traditional detection algorithms.\nThis paper proposes a distortion-based algorithm to improve the reliability of\nHIF detection. Firstly, the challenges brought by the diversity of HIF\ncharacteristics are illustrated with the experiments in a 10kV distribution\nsystem. Then, HIFs are classified into five types according to their\ncharacteristics. Secondly, an interval slope is defined to describe the\nwaveform distortions of HIFs, and is extracted with the methods of the linear\nleast square filtering (LLSF) and the Grubbs-criterion-based robust local\nregression smoothing (Grubbs-RLRS), so that feature descriptions under\ndifferent fault conditions can be unified.

Relying on power\ncontrol, existing approaches throttle the rates of cell-center users, while\nmulti-user detection requires accurate channel estimates for the cell-edge\nusers, which is another challenge due to their low received signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR). Utilizing the fact that cell-edge user signals are weak but common\n(received at roughly equal power) at different base stations (BSs), this paper\nestablishes a connection between cell-edge user detection and generalized\ncanonical correlation analysis (GCCA).

However, with increasing disk capacity and data\ncontent, file system C/R tools notoriously suffer from long runtimes. We posit\nthat current file system checkers fail to exploit CPU parallelism and high\nthroughput offered by modern storage devices. To overcome these challenges, we\npropose pFSCK, a tool that redesigns C/R to enable fine-grained parallelism at\nthe granularity of inodes without impacting the correctness of C/R's\nfunctionality. To accelerate C/R, pFSCK first employs data parallelism by\nidentifying functional operations in each stage of the checker and isolating\ndependent operation and their shared data structures. However, fully isolating\nshared structures is infeasible, consequently requiring serialization that\nlimits scalability. To reduce the impact of synchronization bottlenecks and\nexploit CPU parallelism, pFSCK designs pipeline parallelism allowing multiple\nstages of C/R to run simultaneously without impacting correctness. To realize\nefficient pipeline parallelism for different file system data configurations,\npFSCK provides techniques for ordering updates to global data structures,\nefficient per-thread I/O cache management, and dynamic thread placement across\ndifferent passes of a C/R. Finally, pFSCK designs a resource-aware scheduler\naimed towards reducing the impact of C/R on other applications sharing CPUs and\nthe file system. Evaluation of pFSCK shows more than 2.6x gains of e2fsck and\nmore than 1.8x over XFS's checker that provides coarse-grained parallelism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2020 01:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

The drying evolution starts\nwith a constant contact radius mode and shifts to a mixed mode where both fluid\nfront and contact angle changes.

It is a challenging task since the dense prediction\ncan only be achieved under the guidance of latent features defined by sparse\nannotations. Existing meta-learning method tends to fail in generating\ncategory-specifically discriminative descriptor when the visual features\nextracted from support images are marginalized in embedding space. To address\nthis issue, this paper presents an adaptive tuning framework, in which the\ndistribution of latent features across different episodes is dynamically\nadjusted based on a self-segmentation scheme, augmenting category-specific\ndescriptors for label prediction. Specifically, a novel self-supervised\ninner-loop is firstly devised as the base learner to extract the underlying\nsemantic features from the support image. Then, gradient maps are calculated by\nback-propagating self-supervised loss through the obtained features, and\nleveraged as guidance for augmenting the corresponding elements in embedding\nspace. Finally, with the ability to continuously learn from different episodes,\nan optimization-based meta-learner is adopted as outer loop of our proposed\nframework to gradually refine the segmentation results.

To this end, the ensemble-based\nBayesian methods have been used for CFD applications. However, their\napplicability for UQ has not been fully analyzed and understood thus far.

The city clustering algorithm is employed to identify urban\nboundaries for defining comparable study areas; box-counting method and the\ndirect determination method are utilized to extract spatial data; the least\nsquares calculation is employed to estimate the global and local multifractal\nparameters. The results showed multifractal structure of urban street networks.\nThe global multifractal dimension spectrums are inverse S-shaped curves, while\nthe local singularity spectrums are asymmetric unimodal curves.

However, recent observations of GeV\n$\\gamma$-rays from classical novae have hinted that shocks internal to the nova\nejecta may dominate the nova emission. Shocks have also been suggested to power\nthe luminosity of events as diverse as stellar mergers (Metzger & Pejcha 2017),\nsupernovae (Moriya et al. 2018), and tidal disruption events (Roth et al.\n2016), but observational confirmation has been lacking.

Prior works have considered the diversity of ground-truth\nanswers of human annotators. In contrast, we analyze the difficulty of visual\nquestions based on the behavior of multiple different VQA models. We propose to\ncluster the entropy values of the predicted answer distributions obtained by\nthree different models: a baseline method that takes as input images and\nquestions, and two variants that take as input images only and questions only.\nWe use a simple k-means to cluster the visual questions of the VQA v2\nvalidation set. Then we use state-of-the-art methods to determine the accuracy\nand the entropy of the answer distributions for each cluster. A benefit of the\nproposed method is that no annotation of the difficulty is required, because\nthe accuracy of each cluster reflects the difficulty of visual questions that\nbelong to it. Our approach can identify clusters of difficult visual questions\nthat are not answered correctly by state-of-the-art methods. Detailed analysis\non the VQA v2 dataset reveals that 1) all methods show poor performances on the\nmost difficult cluster (about 10\\% accuracy), 2) as the cluster difficulty\nincreases, the answers predicted by the different methods begin to differ, and\n3) the values of cluster entropy are highly correlated with the cluster\naccuracy.

Further papers have built on these schemes, e.g. to\npropose secure routing protocols for wireless sensor networks. Unfortunately,\nas we show in this paper, all three schemes are completely insecure; whilst the\ndetails of their operation varies, they share common weaknesses. In every case\nwe show that an attacker equipped with the information built into at most two\nsensor nodes can compute group keys for all possible groups of which the\nattacked nodes are not a member, which breaks a fundamental design objective.\nThe attacks can also be achieved by an attacker armed with the information from\na single node together with a single group key to which this sensor node is not\nentitled. Repairing the schemes appears difficult, if not impossible. The\nexistence of major flaws is not surprising given the complete absence of any\nrigorous proofs of security for the proposed schemes. A further recent paper\nproposes a group membership authentication and key establishment scheme based\non one of the three key pre-distribution schemes analysed here; as we\ndemonstrate, this scheme is also insecure, as the attack we describe on the\ncorresponding pre-distribution scheme enables the authentication process to be\ncompromised.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2020 12:17:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 14:51:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 14:30:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 16:48:23 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 08:34:20 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 09:36:36 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 16:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

While the paradigm shift from a game\nexecution on clients to streaming games from the cloud offers a variety of\nbenefits, the new services also require a highly reliable and low latency\nnetwork to achieve a satisfying Quality of Experience (QoE) for its users.\nUsing a cloud gaming service with high latency would harm the interaction of\nthe user with the game, leading to a decrease in playing performance and thus\nfrustration of players. However, the negative effect of delay on gaming QoE\ndepends strongly on the game content. At a certain level of delay, a slow-paced\ncard game is typically not as delay sensitive as a shooting game. For optimal\nresource allocation and quality estimation, it is highly important for cloud\nproviders, game developers, and network planners to consider the impact of the\ngame content. This paper contributes to a better understanding of the delay\nimpact on QoE for cloud gaming applications by identifying game characteristics\ninfluencing the delay perception of users. In addition, an expert evaluation\nmethodology to quantify these characteristics, as well as a delay sensitivity\nclassification based on a decision tree is presented. The ratings of 14 experts\nfor the quantification indicated an excellent level of agreement which\ndemonstrates the reliability of the proposed method.

The quantum version of a probability distribution is a\ndensity operator, the quantum version of marginalizing is an operation called\nthe partial trace, and the quantum version of a marginal probability\ndistribution is a reduced density operator. Every joint probability\ndistribution on a finite set can be modeled as a rank one density operator. By\napplying the partial trace, we obtain reduced density operators whose diagonals\nrecover classical marginal probabilities. In general, these reduced densities\nwill have rank higher than one, and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors will\ncontain extra information that encodes subsystem interactions governed by\nstatistics. We decode this information, and show it is akin to conditional\nprobability, and then investigate the extent to which the eigenvectors capture\n\"concepts\" inherent in the original joint distribution. The theory is then\nillustrated with an experiment that exploits these ideas. Turning to a more\ntheoretical application, we also discuss a preliminary framework for modeling\nentailment and concept hierarchy in natural language, namely, by representing\nexpressions in the language as densities. Finally, initial inspiration for this\nthesis comes from formal concept analysis, which finds many striking parallels\nwith the linear algebra. The parallels are not coincidental, and a common\nblueprint is found in category theory.

Small perturbations\nto sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to\nchange network-based decisions, which was recently shown to cause an autonomous\nvehicle to swerve into another lane. In light of these dangers, numerous\nalgorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial\ninputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates.\nThis work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an\nonline certifiably robust for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The\nproposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during\nexecution to identify and choose a robust action under a worst-case deviation\nin input space due to possible adversaries or noise.

Typically, a dynamical system model is based on some\nprior knowledge about the underlying dynamics of interest in which\nprobabilistic features are used to quantify and propagate uncertainties\nassociated with the initial conditions, external excitations, etc. From a\nprobabilistic modeling standing point, two broad classes of methods exist, i.e.\nmacro-scale methods and micro-scale methods. Classically, macro-scale methods\nsuch as statistical moments-based strategies are usually too coarse to capture\nthe multi-mode shape or tails of a non-Gaussian distribution. Micro-scale\nmethods such as random samples-based approaches, on the other hand, become\ncomputationally very challenging in dealing with high-dimensional stochastic\nsystems. In view of these potential limitations, a meso-scale scheme is\nproposed here that utilizes a meso-scale statistical structure to describe the\ndynamical evolution from a probabilistic perspective. The significance of this\nstatistical structure is two-fold. First, it can be tailored to any arbitrary\nrandom space. Second, it not only maintains the probability evolution around\nsample trajectories but also requires fewer meso-scale components than the\nmicro-scale samples. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed meso-scale\nscheme, a set of examples of increasing complexity are provided. Connections to\nthe benchmark stochastic models as conservative and Markov models along with\npractical implementation guidelines are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2020 19:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

These techniques have transformed traditional data\nmining-based analysis radically into a learning-based model in which existing\ndata sets along with their cluster labels (i.e., train set) are learned to\nbuild a supervised learning model and predict the cluster labels of unseen data\n(i.e., test set). In particular, deep learning techniques are capable of\ncapturing and learning hidden features in a given data sets and thus building a\nmore accurate prediction model for clustering and labeling problem. However,\nthe major problem is that time series data are often unlabeled and thus\nsupervised learning-based deep learning algorithms cannot be directly adapted\nto solve the clustering problems for these special and complex types of data\nsets. To address this problem, this paper introduces a two-stage method for\nclustering time series data. First, a novel technique is introduced to utilize\nthe characteristics (e.g., volatility) of given time series data in order to\ncreate labels and thus be able to transform the problem from unsupervised\nlearning into supervised learning. Second, an autoencoder-based deep learning\nmodel is built to learn and model both known and hidden features of time series\ndata along with their created labels to predict the labels of unseen time\nseries data. The paper reports a case study in which financial and stock time\nseries data of selected 70 stock indices are clustered into distinct groups\nusing the introduced two-stage procedure. The results show that the proposed\nprocedure is capable of achieving 87.5\\% accuracy in clustering and predicting\nthe labels for unseen time series data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2020 18:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}
