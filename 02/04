This paper aims to\nanswer two questions: 1) whether quantifiable measurement of public opinion can\nbe obtained from social media and 2) whether it can produce better or\ncomplementary measures compared to opinion polls. This research proposes a\nnovel approach to measure the relative opinion of Twitter users towards public\nissues in order to accommodate more complex opinion structures and take\nadvantage of the geography pertaining to the public issues. To ensure that this\nnew measure is technically feasible, a modeling framework is developed\nincluding building a training dataset by adopting a state-of-the-art approach\nand devising a new deep learning method called Opinion-Oriented Word Embedding.\nWith a case study of the tweets selected for the 2016 U.S. presidential\nelection, we demonstrate the predictive superiority of our relative opinion\napproach and we show how it can aid visual analytics and support opinion\npredictions. Although the relative opinion measure is proved to be more robust\ncompared to polling, our study also suggests that the former can advantageously\ncomplement the later in opinion prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 16:01:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 23:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

In this study, we demonstrate room temperature charge\nredistribution in a CeO2 thin film as a result of phase transformation in a\nlocalized region by mechanical deformation. Mechanical indentation of the CeO2\nthin film at room temperature results in irreversible deformation.\nConductive-tip atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) analysis shows increased current\npassing through the locally deformed area of the CeO2 thin film. Electron\nenergy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis equipped with transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM) suggests that the increase in current contrast in the deformed\nregion arises from an increased concentration of Ce3+ ions. We herein discuss\nthe fundamental reason behind the increased amount of Ce3+ ions in the deformed\narea, based on the atomic scale computational works performed by molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations and first-principles density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations. Plastic deformation induces a phase transformation of cubic\nfluorite CeO2 into a newly formed T-CeO2 structure.

The simplest solution to\nsolve this computationally hard problem is to decompose it into independent\nlayer-wise subproblems. However, neuroscientific evidence would suggest\ninter-connecting these subproblems as in the Predictive Coding (PC) theory,\nwhich adds top-down connections between consecutive layers. In this study, a\nnew model called 2-Layers Sparse Predictive Coding (2L-SPC) is introduced to\nassess the impact of this inter-layer feedback connection. In particular, the\n2L-SPC is compared with a Hierarchical Lasso (Hi-La) network made out of a\nsequence of independent Lasso layers. The 2L-SPC and the 2-layers Hi-La\nnetworks are trained on 4 different databases and with different sparsity\nparameters on each layer. First, we show that the overall prediction error\ngenerated by 2L-SPC is lower thanks to the feedback mechanism as it transfers\nprediction error between layers. Second, we demonstrate that the inference\nstage of the 2L-SPC is faster to converge than for the Hi-La model. Third, we\nshow that the 2L-SPC also accelerates the learning process. Finally, the\nqualitative analysis of both models dictionaries, supported by their activation\nprobability, show that the 2L-SPC features are more generic and informative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 17:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

A major challenge is the\npresence of magnetic disturbances that result in unreliable magnetometer\nreadings. Recent research revealed that this problem can be overcome by\nexploitation of kinematic constraints. While typically each segment of the\nkinematic chain is equipped with an IMU, a novel approach called sparse\ninertial motion tracking aims at infering the complete motion states from\nmeasurements of a reduced set of sensors. In the present contribution, we\ncombine the magnetometer-free and the sparse approach for real-time motion\ntracking of double-hinge joint systems with non-parallel joint axes.

It is reported, however, that the bit error rate of RRAMs can be up\nto 3.3% in the ultra low-power setting, which might be crucial for many use\ncases. Binary neural networks (BNNs), a resource efficient variant of neural\nnetworks (NNs), can tolerate a certain percentage of errors without a loss in\naccuracy and demand lower resources in computation and storage. The bit error\ntolerance (BET) in BNNs can be achieved by flipping the weight signs during\ntraining, as proposed by Hirtzlin et al., but their method has a significant\ndrawback, especially for fully connected neural networks (FCNN): The FCNNs\noverfit to the error rate used in training, which leads to low accuracy under\nlower error rates. In addition, the underlying principles of BET are not\ninvestigated. In this work, we improve the training for BET of BNNs and aim to\nexplain this property. We propose straight-through gradient approximation to\nimprove the weight-sign-flip training, by which BNNs adapt less to the bit\nerror rates. To explain the achieved robustness, we define a metric that aims\nto measure BET without fault injection. We evaluate the metric and find that it\ncorrelates with accuracy over error rate for all FCNNs tested. Finally, we\nexplore the influence of a novel regularizer that optimizes with respect to\nthis metric, with the aim of providing a configurable trade-off in accuracy and\nBET.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 17:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

The impacts of variability of offshore wind\noutput along with energy- and capacity-market prices are evaluated using\npublicly available data from 2010 to 2013.

Thus, it may be seen\nas an altruistic allocation for essential players what can be criticized. The\naim this paper is two-fold: to study the structure and complexity of the core\nof PI-games and to introduce new core allocations for PI-games improving the\nweaknesses of the Owen point. Regarding the first goal, we advance further on\nthe analysis of PI-games and we analyze its core structure and algorithmic\ncomplexity. Specifically, we prove that the number of extreme points of the\ncore of PI-games is exponential on the number of players. On the other hand, we\npropose and characterize a new core-allocation, the Omega point, which\ncompensates the essential players for their role on reducing the costs of their\nfans. Moreover, we define another solution concept, the Quid Pro Quo set\n(QPQ-set) of allocations, which is based on the Owen and Omega points. Among\nall the allocations in this set, we emphasize what we call the Solomonic QPQ\nallocation and we provide some necessary conditions for the coincidence of that\nallocation with the Shapley value and the Nucleolus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 17:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

One of the next\nissues is to take polarization images around the central black hole (BH). Since\nradio emission is produced by synchrotron process, polarization properties\nshould vividly reflect the magnetic field structure at the jet base and thus\nprovide good information regarding the magnetic mechanism of jet formation.\nWith this kept in mind we perform general relativistic (GR) radiative transfer\ncalculations of polarized light based on the GR magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulation data of accretion flow and outflow in M87, to obtain their linear\nand circular polarization images in the horizon-scale. We found that the linear\npolarization components from the jet base and inner accretion flow should\nexperience Faraday rotation when passing through magnetized plasmas around the\nBH, thus sensitively depending on the BH spin. Through the comparison with\nintensity image at 1.3mm by EHT and the polarized degree and the rotation\nmeasure (RM) at 1.3mm with the Submillimeter Array, the model with the spin\nparameter of a=0.9M_BH (with M_BH being the BH mass) is favored over other\nmodels with a=0.5M_BH or 0.99M_BH, though we need further systematic studies\nfor confirmation. We also find in low-temperature models clear ring-like image\nin the circular polarization map, which arises because of Faraday conversion of\nthe linearly polarized synchrotron emission and is thus indicative of magnetic\nfield. This occurs only when the emission region is threaded with well-ordered\nmagnetic fields and hence no clear images are expected in high-temperature disk\nmodels, in which disk emission is appreciable. We will be able to elucidate the\nfield configuration through the comparison between the simulated polarization\nimages and future polarimetry with EHT and other VLBI observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 21:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

Within\nthese models, different classes of BH solutions are possible, depending on the\nnon-minimal coupling function $f(\\phi)$, between the scalar field and the\nMaxwell invariant. Here we consider the class wherein both the (bald)\nelectrovacuum Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om (RN) BH and new scalarised BHs co-exist, and\nthe former are never unstable against scalar perturbations. In particular we\nexamine the model, within this subclass, with a quartic coupling function:\n$f(\\Phi) = 1+\\alpha \\Phi ^4$. The domain of existence of the scalarised BHs,\nfor fixed $\\alpha$, is composed of two branches. The first branch (cold\nscalarised BHs) is continuously connected to the extremal RN BH. The second\nbranch (hot scalarised BHs) connects to the first one at the minimum value of\nthe charge to mass ratio and it includes overcharged BHs. We then assess the\nperturbative stability of the scalarised solutions, focusing on spherical\nperturbations. On the one hand, cold scalarised BHs are shown to be unstable by\nexplicitly computing growing modes. The instability is quenched at both\nendpoints of the first branch. On the other hand, hot scalarised BHs are shown\nto be stable by using the S-deformation method. Thus, in the spherical sector\nthis model possesses two stable BH local ground states (RN and hot scalarised).\nWe point out that the branch structure of BHs in this model parallels the one\nof BHs in five dimensional vacuum gravity, with [Myer-Perry BHs, fat rings,\nthin rings] playing the role of [RN, cold scalarised, hot scalarised] BHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-25"}

In\nrecent years Sorkin has proposed an alternative, manifestly covariant,\nformulation of entropy in terms of the spacetime two-point correlation\nfunction. This formulation, developed for a Gaussian scalar field theory, is\nexplicitly spacetime in nature and evades some of the possible non-covariance\nissues faced by the conventional formulation. In this paper we take the first\nsteps towards extending Sorkin's entropy to non-Gaussian theories where Wick's\ntheorem no longer holds and one would expect higher correlators to contribute.\nWe consider quartic perturbations away from the Gaussian case and find that to\nfirst order in perturbation theory, the entropy formula derived by Sorkin\ncontinues to hold but with the two-point correlators replaced by their\nperturbation-corrected counterparts. We then show that our results continue to\nhold for arbitrary perturbations (of both bosonic and fermionic theories). This\nis a non-trivial and, to our knowledge, novel result.

A\ngravitating mass located between a source and a detector deflects the neutrinos\nin their journey, and at a detection point, neutrinos arriving through\ndifferent paths can lead to the phenomenon of interference. The flavour\ntransition probabilities computed in the presence of such interference depend\non the individual masses of neutrinos whenever there is a non-zero path\ndifference between the interfering neutrinos.

The X-ray emission based on archival XMM-Newton\nobservations is highly variable, showing rapid variations (10 s) from a high\nX-ray luminosity mode to a low mode and back. A flaring mode has also been\nobserved. X-ray pulsations have been detected during the high mode only. In\nthis work we present two possible interpretations for the rapid swings between\nthe high and low modes. In the first scenario, this phenomenon can be explained\nby a rapid oscillation between a propeller state and a radio-ejection pulsar\nstate, during which the pulsar wind prevents matter from falling onto the\nneutron star surface. In the second scenario, a radio pulsar is always active,\nthe intra-binary shock is located just outside the light cylinder in the high\nmode, while it expands during the low mode. At variance with other transitional\npulsars, J12270 shows two instances of the low mode: a low-soft and low-hard\nmode. Performing an X-ray spectral analysis, we show that the harder component,\npresent in the low-hard spectra, is probably related to the tail of the flare\nemission.

Whether this is also the case at higher redshift\nand in the early Universe remains debated. The ALPINE survey, which targeted\n118 star-forming galaxies at $4.4 < z< 5.9$, provides a new opportunity to\nexamine this question with the first statistical dataset. Using the ALPINE data\nand earlier measurements from the literature we examine the relation between\nthe [CII] luminosity and the SFR over the entire redshift range from $z \\sim\n4-8$. ALPINE galaxies, which are both detected in [CII] and dust continuum,\nshow a good agreement with the local L([CII])-SFR relation.

After accounting for dust-obscured star formation, by an amount\nSFR(IR)$\\approx$SFR(UV) on average, which results from two different stacking\nmethods and SED fitting, the ALPINE galaxies show an L([CII])-SFR relation\ncomparable to the local one.

This motivates questions on differences in\nprogenitors, explosion mechanisms, and $^{56}$Ni estimation methods. Here, we\nre-estimate the nucleosynthetic yields of $^{56}$Ni for a well-observed and\nwell-defined sample of SE-SNe in a uniform manner.

We compiled a sample of well observed SE-SNe and measured\n$^{56}$Ni masses through three different methods proposed in the literature.\nArnett's rule -as previously shown - gives $^{56}$Ni masses for SE-SNe that are\nconsiderably higher than SNe-II. While for the distributions calculated using\nboth the Khatami&Kasen prescription and Tail $^{56}$Ni masses are offset to\nlower values than `Arnett values', their $^{56}$Ni distributions are still\nstatistically higher than that of SNe II.

Super DTI bypasses the\ntensor fitting procedure, which is well known to be highly susceptible to noise\nand motion in DWIs. The network is trained and tested using datasets from Human\nConnectome Project and patients with ischemic stroke. SuperDTI is compared\nagainst the state-of-the-art methods for diffusion map reconstruction and fiber\ntracking. Results: Using training and testing data both from the same protocol\nand scanner, SuperDTI is shown to generate fractional anisotropy and mean\ndiffusivity maps, as well as fiber tractography, from as few as six raw DWIs.\nThe method achieves a quantification error of less than 5% in all regions of\ninterest in white matter and gray matter structures.

Current systems experiment difficulties performing this task, as\nit is complicated to design an automatic procedure that can classify this\ninformation independent on the context.

Reliability analysis\nfor these systems when failure probabilities are small is significantly\nchallenging, requiring a large number of costly simulations. To address this\nchallenge, this paper introduces Reliability analysis through Error rate-based\nAdaptive Kriging (REAK). An extension of the Central Limit Theorem based on\nLindeberg condition is adopted here to derive the distribution of the number of\ndesign samples with wrong sign estimate and subsequently determine the maximum\nerror rate for failure probability estimates. This error rate enables optimal\nestablishment of effective sampling regions at each stage of an adaptive scheme\nfor strategic generation of design samples. Moreover, it facilitates setting a\ntarget accuracy for failure probability estimation, which is used as stopping\ncriterion for reliability analysis. These capabilities together can\nsignificantly reduce the number of calls to sophisticated, computationally\ndemanding models. The application of REAK for four examples with varying extent\nof nonlinearity and dimension is presented. Results indicate that REAK is able\nto reduce the computational demand by as high as 50% compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods of Adaptive Kriging with Monte Carlo Simulation\n(AK-MCS) and Improved Sequential Kriging Reliability Analysis (ISKRA).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 03:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

In particular, the dark photon of\n$U(1)_{T3R}$ is always produced and equilibrates in the early Universe, no\nmatter how small the gauge coupling, unless the symmetry-breaking scale is\nextremely large. This occurs because, no matter how the weak the coupling, the\nGoldstone mode (equivalently, the longitudinal polarization) does not decouple.\nAs a result, even the limit of an extremely light and weakly-coupled dark\nphoton of $U(1)_{T3R}$ is effectively ruled out by cosmological constraints,\nunless the symmetry-breaking scale is extremely large.

We design an end-to-end training\npipeline to jointly learn the saliency prediction and SESR on a shared\nhierarchical feature space for fast inference. Moreover, we present UFO-120,\nthe first dataset to facilitate large-scale SESR learning; it contains over\n1500 training samples and a benchmark test set of 120 samples. By thorough\nexperimental evaluation on the UFO-120 and other standard datasets, we\ndemonstrate that Deep SESR outperforms the existing solutions for underwater\nimage enhancement and super-resolution. We also validate its generalization\nperformance on several test cases that include underwater images with diverse\nspectral and spatial degradation levels, and also terrestrial images with\nunseen natural objects. Lastly, we analyze its computational feasibility for\nsingle-board deployments and demonstrate its operational benefits for\nvisually-guided underwater robots.

Relational\ndatabases support the LIKE operator to allow searching with a particular\nwildcard predicate (e.g., LIKE 'Sub%', which matches all strings starting with\n'Sub'). Due to the large size of text data, executing such queries in the most\noptimal way is quite critical for database performance. While building the most\nefficient execution plan for a LIKE query, the query optimizer requires the\nselectivity estimate for the flexible pattern-based query predicate. Recently,\nSPH algorithm is proposed which employs a sequence pattern-based histogram\nstructure to estimate the selectivity of LIKE queries. A drawback of the SPH\napproach is that it often overestimates the selectivity of queries. In order to\nalleviate the overestimation problem, in this paper, we propose a novel\nsequence pattern type, called positional sequence patterns. The proposed\npatterns differentiate between sequence item pairs that appear next to each\nother in all pattern occurrences from those that may have other items between\nthem.

So far this has not been\ndone with the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) ground-based\nobservations, which have different noise properties.\n  Aims: We utilize 17 years of GONG++ data, to identify and characterize solar\nRossby waves using ring-diagram helioseismology. We compare directly with HMI\nring-diagram analysis.\n  Methods: Maps of the radial vorticity are obtained for flows within the top 2\nMm of the surface for 17 years of GONG++. The data is corrected for systematic\neffects including the annual periodicity related to the $B_0$ angle. We then\ncompute the Fourier components of the radial vorticity of the flows in the\nco-rotating frame. We perform the same analysis on the HMI data that overlap in\ntime.\n  Results: We find that the solar Rossby waves have measurable amplitudes in\nthe GONG++ sectoral power spectra for azimuthal orders between $m=3$ and\n$m=15$. The measured mode characteristics (frequencies, lifetimes and\namplitudes) from GONG++ are consistent with the HMI measurements in the overlap\nperiod from 2010 to 2018 for $m\\le9$. For higher-$m$ modes the amplitudes and\nfrequencies agree within two sigmas. The signal-to-noise ratio of modes in\nGONG++ power spectra is comparable to HMI for $8\\le m\\le11$, but is lower by a\nfactor of two for other modes.\n  Conclusions: The GONG++ data provide a long and uniform data set to study\nsolar global-scale Rossby waves from 2001.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 09:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

By working in the canonical ensemble\nof a single impurity, we show that the impurity spectral response is directly\nconnected to the finite-temperature equation of state (free energy) of the\nimpurity. We consider two different response protocols: \"injection\", where the\nimpurity is introduced into the medium from an initially non-interacting state;\nand \"ejection\", where the impurity is ejected from an initially interacting\nstate with the medium. We show that there is a simple mapping between injection\nand ejection spectra, which is connected to the detailed balance condition in\nthermal equilibrium. To illustrate the power of our approach, we specialize to\nthe case of the Fermi polaron, corresponding to an impurity atom that is\nimmersed in a non-interacting Fermi gas. For a mobile impurity with a mass\nequal to the fermion mass, we employ a finite-temperature variational approach\nto obtain the impurity spectral response. We find a striking non-monotonic\ndependence on temperature in the impurity free energy, the contact, and the\nradio-frequency spectra. For the case of an infinitely heavy Fermi polaron, we\nderive exact results for the finite-temperature free energy, thus generalizing\nFumi's theorem to arbitrary temperature. We also determine the exact dynamics\nof the contact after a quench of the impurity-fermion interactions. Finally, we\nshow that the injection and ejection spectra obtained from the variational\napproach compare well with the exact spectra, thus demonstrating the accuracy\nof our approximate method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 10:20:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 06:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

Therefore\nthe identification and characterisation of whistlers are important tasks to\nmonitor the plasmasphere in real-time and to build large databases of events to\nbe used for statistical studies.

This\nprocess is critical for the current society, preventing waterborne illnesses,\nproviding safe drinking water and enhancing general sanitation. To keep a sewer\nnetwork perfectly operational, sampling inspections are performed constantly to\nidentify obstructions. Typically, a Closed-Circuit Television system is used to\nrecord the inside of pipes and report the obstruction level, which may trigger\na cleaning operative. Currently, the obstruction level assessment is done\nmanually, which is time-consuming and inconsistent. In this work, we design a\nmethodology to train a Convolutional Neural Network for identifying the level\nof obstruction in pipes, thus reducing the human effort required on such a\nfrequent and repetitive task.

The\nanisotropic stress of the PMFs can act as a source of the super-horizon\ncurvature perturbation in the early universe. If the amplitude of PMFs is\nsufficiently large, the resultant density perturbation also has a large\namplitude, and thereby, the PBH abundance is enhanced. Since the anisotropic\nstress of the PMFs is consist of the square of the magnetic fields, the\nstatistics of the density perturbation follows the non-Gaussian distribution.\nAssuming Gaussian distributions and delta-function type power spectrum for\nPMFs, based on a Monte-Carlo method, we obtain an approximate probability\ndensity function of the density perturbation, and it is an important piece to\nrelate the amplitude of PMFs with the abundance of PBHs.

It was discovered in the Chandra\nX-ray image by Werner and collaborators, who considered a possibility of it\nbeing a boundary of an AGN-inflated bubble located outside the core, but\ndiscounted this possibility because it required much too powerful an AGN\noutburst. Using low-frequency (72-240 MHz) radio data from MWA GLEAM and GMRT,\nwe found that the X-ray structure is, in fact, a giant cavity in the X-ray gas\nfilled with diffuse radio emission with an extraordinarily steep radio\nspectrum. It thus appears to be a very aged fossil of the most powerful AGN\noutburst seen in any galaxy cluster ($pV\\sim 5\\times 10^{61}$ erg for this\ncavity). There is no apparent diametrically opposite counterpart either in\nX-ray or in the radio. It may have aged out of the observable radio band\nbecause of the cluster asymmetry. At present, the central AGN exhibits only a\nweak radio source, so it should have been much more powerful in the past to\nhave produced such a bubble. The AGN is currently starved of accreting cool gas\nbecause the gas density peak is displaced by core sloshing. The sloshing itself\ncould have been set off by this extraordinary explosion if it had occurred in\nan asymmetric gas core. This dinosaur may be an early example of a new class of\nsources to be uncovered by low-frequency surveys of galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 14:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

Their answers to debates on the constitution of the early\nmodern scientific revolution or the novelty of the work of Max Planck will\nillustrate how notions of 'center' and 'periphery' have shifted--and what that\nmay tell us about being 'in Europe' today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 14:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

Understanding the drug release\nkinetics and corresponding transport mechanisms of nanoparticles (NPs) in a\nthermoresponsive hydrogel network is the key to the successful design of a\nsmart drug delivery system. We construct a mesoscopic model of rigid NPs\nentrapped in a hydrogel network in an aqueous solution, where the hydrogel\nnetwork is formed by cross-linked semiflexible polymers of PNIPAM. By varying\nthe environmental temperature crossing the lower critical solution temperature\nof PNIPAM we can significantly change the hydrogel network characteristics. We\nsystematically investigate how the matrix porosity and the nanoparticle size\naffect the NPs' transport kinetics at different temperatures. Quantitative\nresults on the mean-squared displacement and the van Hove displacement\ndistributions of NPs show that all NPs entrapped in the smart hydrogels undergo\nsubdiffusion at both low and high temperatures. For a coil state, the\nsubdiffusive exponent and the diffusion coefficient of NPs increase due to the\nincreased kinetic energy and the decreased confinement on NPs, while the\ntransport of NPs in the hydrogels can be also enhanced by decreasing the matrix\nporosity and NPs' size. However, when the solution temperature is increased\nabove the critical temperature, the hydrogel network collapses following the\ncoil-to-globule transition, with the NPs tightly trapped in some local regions\ninside the hydrogels. Consequently, the NP diffusion coefficient can be reduced\nby two orders of magnitude, or the diffusion processes can even be completely\nstopped.

This sample is roughly three times larger than number\nof measurements available before. For both the complete sample and its younger\npart (spin-down ages $\\tau < 3$ Myr), we find that a bimodal Maxwellian\ndistribution describes the measured parallaxes and proper motions better than a\nsingle Maxwellian with probability of 99.3 and 95.0 per cent respectively. The\nbimodal Maxwellian distribution has three parameters: fraction of low-velocity\npulsars and distribution parameters $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ for low and\nhigh-velocity modes. For a complete sample, these parameters are as follows:\n$42_{-15}^{+17}$ per cent, $\\sigma_1=128_{-18}^{+22}$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\\sigma_2\n= 298\\pm 28$ km s$^{-1}$.

In\nthe young population, $5\\pm 3$ per cent of pulsars has velocities less than 60\nkm s$^{-1}$.

As the technology evolved, the demand for a proper means of\nsupporting and managing crowdsensing and real-time data increased, and cloud\nservers could no longer keep up with the large volumes of incoming data.

Such forecasting is challenging due to human-human and human-object\ninteractions and future uncertainties caused by human randomness. Generative\nmodel-based methods handle future uncertainties by sampling a latent variable.\nHowever, few studies explored the generation of the latent variable. In this\nwork, we propose the Trajectory Predictor with Pseudo Oracle (TPPO), which is a\ngenerative model-based trajectory predictor. The first pseudo oracle is\npedestrians' moving directions, and the second one is the latent variable\nestimated from ground truth trajectories. A social attention module is used to\naggregate neighbors' interactions based on the correlation between pedestrians'\nmoving directions and future trajectories. This correlation is inspired by the\nfact that pedestrians' future trajectories are often influenced by pedestrians\nin front. A latent variable predictor is proposed to estimate latent variable\ndistributions from observed and ground-truth trajectories. Moreover, the gap\nbetween these two distributions is minimized during training. Therefore, the\nlatent variable predictor can estimate the latent variable from observed\ntrajectories to approximate that estimated from ground-truth trajectories. We\ncompare the performance of TPPO with related methods on several public\ndatasets. Results demonstrate that TPPO outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nwith low average and final displacement errors. The ablation study shows that\nthe prediction performance will not dramatically decrease as sampling times\ndecline during tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 03:28:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:57:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 06:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

All of\nthese notions are especially important in the study of linear-interval and\nlinear-semiorder dimension of a binary relation.

The intuition is that the classification result of a normal\nimage is generally resistant to non-significant intrinsic feature changes,\ne.g., varying thickness of handwritten digits. In contrast, adversarial\nexamples are sensitive to such changes since the perturbation lacks\ntransferability. To enable manipulation of features, a combo-variational\nautoencoder is applied to learn disentangled latent codes that reveal semantic\nfeatures. The resistance to classification change over the morphs, derived by\nvarying and reconstructing latent codes, is used to detect suspicious inputs.\nFurther, combo-VAE is enhanced to purify the adversarial examples with good\nquality by considering both class-shared and class-unique features. We\nempirically demonstrate the effectiveness of detection and the quality of\npurified instance.

These multilayer perceptrons process the level-set values from\nmesh points next to the free boundary and output the dimensionless curvature at\ntheir closest locations on the interface. Accuracy analyses involving irregular\ninterfaces, in both uniform and adaptive grids, show that our models are\ncompetitive with traditional numerical schemes in the $L^1$ and $L^2$ norms. In\nparticular, our neural networks approximate curvature with comparable precision\nin coarse resolutions, when the interface features steep curvature regions, and\nwhen the number of iterations to reinitialize the level-set function is small.\nAlthough the conventional numerical approach is more robust than our framework,\nour results have unveiled the potential of machine learning for dealing with\ncomputational tasks where the level-set method is known to experience\ndifficulties. We also establish that an application-dependent map of local\nresolutions to neural models can be devised to estimate mean curvature more\neffectively than a universal neural network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 00:49:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 04:46:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 03:14:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 04:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Supervised deep learning methods have been investigated to\nimplement numerical observers for task-based image quality assessment. However,\nlabeling large amounts of experimental data to train deep neural networks is\ntedious, expensive, and prone to subjective errors. Computer-simulated image\ndata can potentially be employed to circumvent these issues; however, it is\noften difficult to computationally model complicated anatomical structures,\nnoise sources, and the response of real world imaging systems. Hence, simulated\nimage data will generally possess physical and statistical differences from the\nexperimental image data they seek to emulate. Within the context of machine\nlearning, these differences between the sets of two images is referred to as\ndomain shift. In this study, we propose and investigate the use of an\nadversarial domain adaptation method to mitigate the deleterious effects of\ndomain shift between simulated and experimental image data for deep\nlearning-based numerical observers (DL-NOs) that are trained on simulated\nimages but applied to experimental ones. In the proposed method, a DL-NO will\ninitially be trained on computer-simulated image data and subsequently adapted\nfor use with experimental image data, without the need for any labeled\nexperimental images.

In contrast to microfluidics with continuous flow, sessile\ndroplet approaches enhance the flexibility for fluid manipulation with usually\nless operational effort. Generating biologically favorable conditions and\npromoting cell growth in a droplet, however, is particularly challenging due to\nmass transfer limitations, which has to be solved by implementing an effective\nmixing technique. Here, capillary waves induced by vertical oscillation are\nused to mix inside a sessile droplet micro-bioreactor (MBR) system avoiding\nadditional moving parts inside the fluid. Depending on the excitation\nfrequency, different patterns are formed on the oscillating liquid surface,\nwhich are described by a model of a vibrated sessile droplet. Analyzing mixing\ntimes and oxygen transport into the liquid, a strong dependency of mass\ntransfer on the oscillation parameters, especially the excitation frequency, is\ndemonstrated. Oscillations at distinct capillary wave resonant frequencies lead\nto rapid homogenization with mixing times of 2 s and volumetric liquid-phase\nmass transfer coefficients of more than 340 h-1. This shows that the mass\ntransfer in a droplet MBR can be specifically controlled via capillary waves,\nwhat is subsequently demonstrated for cultivations of Escherichia coli BL21\ncells. Therefore, the presented MBR in combination with vertical oscillation\nmixing for intensified mass transfer is a promising tool for highly parallel\ncultivation and data generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 09:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

Moreover, we show that Machine\nLearning techniques allow to distinguish between different tasks with a good\nclassification accuracy and to investigate more in depth the gaze dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 17:46:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-27"}

Many papers have been published in the literature about the\nutilization of this technology for de-signing many QCA circuits and for\npresenting logic gates in an optimal structure. The T flip-flop, which is an\nessential part of digital designs, can be used to design synchronous and\nasynchronous counters. This paper presents a novel T flip-flop structure in an\noptimal form. The presented novel gate was used to design an N-bit binary\nsynchronous counter. The QCADesigner software was used to verify the designed\ncircuits and to present the simulation results, while the QCAPro tool was used\nfor the power analysis. The proposed design required minimal power and showed\ngood improvements over previous designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 11:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-27"}
