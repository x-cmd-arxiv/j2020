Consequently,\nincreasing effort is being dedicated to the creation of intelligent\ntransportation systems, where decisions on issues ranging from city-wide road\nmaintenance planning to improving the commuting experience are informed by\ncomputational models of urban traffic instead of being left entirely to humans.\nThe automation of traffic management has received substantial attention from\nthe research community, however, most approaches target highways, produce\npredictions valid for a limited time window or require expensive retraining of\navailable models in order to accurately forecast traffic at a new location. In\nthis article, we propose a novel and accurate traffic flow prediction method\nbased on symbolic regression enhanced with a lag operator. Our approach\nproduces robust models suitable for the intricacies of urban roads, much more\ndifficult to predict than highways. Additionally, there is no need to retrain\nthe model for a period of up to 9 weeks. Furthermore, the proposed method\ngenerates models that are transferable to other segments of the road network,\nsimilar to, yet geographically distinct from the ones they were initially\ntrained on. We demonstrate the achievement of these claims by conducting\nextensive experiments on data collected from the Darmstadt urban\ninfrastructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 16:03:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

In particular, these use prior background knowledge described in\nsuch logics to help the training of a neural network from unlabeled and noisy\ndata. By interpreting logical symbols using neural networks, this background\nknowledge can be added to regular loss functions, hence making reasoning a part\nof learning. We study, both formally and empirically, how a large collection of\nlogical operators from the fuzzy logic literature behave in a differentiable\nlearning setting. We find that many of these operators, including some of the\nmost well-known, are highly unsuitable in this setting. A further finding\nconcerns the treatment of implication in these fuzzy logics, and shows a strong\nimbalance between gradients driven by the antecedent and the consequent of the\nimplication. Furthermore, we introduce a new family of fuzzy implications\n(called sigmoidal implications) to tackle this phenomenon. Finally, we\nempirically show that it is possible to use Differentiable Fuzzy Logics for\nsemi-supervised learning, and compare how different operators behave in\npractice. We find that, to achieve the largest performance improvement over a\nsupervised baseline, we have to resort to non-standard combinations of logical\noperators which perform well in learning, but no longer satisfy the usual\nlogical laws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 16:11:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 08:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

We formulate and solve a novel\noptimization problem that jointly determines the optimal D2D user pairing and\nthe optimal power control scheme, where the objective is maximizing the\nachievable sum rate of the whole system while guaranteeing a certain quality of\nservice (QoS) for all users. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer\nnon-linear program (MINLP) which is generally NPhard. To overcome this issue,\nwe reconstruct the original problem into a bi-level optimization problem that\ncan be decomposed into two sub-problems to be solved independently. The outer\nproblem is a linear assignment problem which can be efficiently handled by the\nwell-known Hungarian method. The inner problem is still a non-convex\noptimization problem for which finding the optimal solution is challenging.\nHowever, we derive the optimal power control policies for both the HD and the\nFD schemes in closedform expressions, which makes the computational complexity\nof the inner problems polynomial for every possible pairing configurations.\nThese findings solve ultimately the original MILNP in a timely manner that\nmakes it suitable for real-time and low latency applications.

What is needed are symmetry-based\nexperiments that can rule out broad classes of possible superconducting order\nparameters. Here we use resonant ultrasound spectroscopy to measure the entire\nsymmetry-resolved elastic tensor of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ through the superconducting\ntransition.

A two-component $p$-wave order parameter, such as $p_x+i p_y$,\nnaturally satisfies this requirement.

It has been previously suggested that the TeV\nflares are produced when a relativistic proton jet originating in the core of\nM87 collides with a molecular cloud (or stellar atmosphere) located less than\none parsec from the central black hole.

The effects of shear rate are isolated from those of slip by\nsetting the particle velocity equal to the local fluid velocity (zero slip),\nand examining the resulting hydrodynamic forces as a function of separation\ndistance. In contrast to much of the previous numerical literature, low shear\nReynolds numbers are considered ($10^{-3} \\lesssim Re_{\\gamma} \\lesssim\n10^{-1}$). This shear rate range is relevant when dealing with particulate\nflows within small channels, for example particle migration in microfluidic\ndevices being used or developed for the biotech industry.

Similarly, we validate an\nimproved drag correlation that includes higher order terms in wall separation\ndistance that more accurately captures the drag force when the particle is\nclose to, but not touching, the wall.

This theory is then employed to compute ro-vibrational spectra of\nsingly substituted ozone; roughly, 600 vibrational states of 16O18O16O and\n16O16O18O isomers combined, with rotational excitations up to J=5 and both\ninversion parities (21600 coupled ro-vibrational states total). Splittings\nbetween the states of different parities, so called K-doublings, are calculated\nand analyzed. The roles of the asymmetric-top rotor term and the Coriolis\ncoupling term are determined individually, and it is found that they both\naffect these splittings, but in the opposite directions. Thus, the two effects\npartially cancel out, and the residual splittings are relatively small.\nEnergies of the ro-vibrational states reported in this work for 16O18O16O and\n16O16O18O are in excellent agreement with literature (available for low\nvibrational excitation). New data obtained here for the highly excited\nvibrational states enable the first systematic study of the Coriolis effect in\nsymmetric and asymmetric isotopomers of ozone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 18:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Forecasting new edges in online\nsocial networks can give us a better understanding of the growth of these\nnetworks. There have been many studies of link prediction in the field of\nengineering and humanities. Scientists attribute the existence of a new\nrelationship between two individuals for two reasons: 1) Proximity to the graph\n(structure) 2) Similar properties of the two individuals (Homophile law).\nHowever, studying the impact of the two approaches working together to create\nnew edges remains an open problem. Similarity metrics can also be divided into\ntwo categories; Neighborhood-based and path-based. So far, the above two\ntheoretical approaches (proximity and homophile) have not been found together\nin the neighborhood-based metrics. In this paper, we first attempt to provide a\nsolution to determine importance of the proximity to the graph and similar\nfeatures in the connectivity of the graphs. Then obtained weights are assigned\nto both proximity and homophile. Then the best similarity metric in each\napproach are obtained. Finally, the selected metric of homophily similarity and\nstructural similarity are combined with the obtained weights. The results of\nthis study were evaluated on two datasets; Zanjan University Graduate School of\nSocial Sciences and Pokec online Social Network. The first data set was\ncollected for this study and then the questionnaires and data collection\nmethods were filled out. Since this dataset is one of the few Iranian datasets\nthat has been compiled with its users' specifications, it can be of great\nvalue. In this paper, we have been able to increase the accuracy of\nNeighborhood-based similarity metric by using two proximity in graph and\nhomophily approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 18:43:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

The most significant\nequatorial dipole amplitude obtained is that in the cumulative bin above 8~EeV,\n$d_\\perp=6.0^{+1.0}_{-0.9}$%, which is inconsistent with isotropy at the\n6$\\sigma$ level. In the bins below 8 EeV, we obtain 99% CL upper-bounds on\n$d_\\perp$ at the level of 1 to 3 percent. At energies below 1 EeV, even though\nthe amplitudes are not significant, the phases determined in most of the bins\nare not far from the right ascension of the Galactic center, at $\\alpha_{\\rm\nGC}=-94^\\circ$, suggesting a predominantly Galactic origin for anisotropies at\nthese energies. The reconstructed dipole phases in the energy bins above 4 EeV\npoint instead to right ascensions that are almost opposite to the Galactic\ncenter one, indicative of an extragalactic cosmic ray origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 18:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-11"}

However, there does often\nexist a substantial cognitive distance between the recursive definition and the\nsimplest explanation of an algorithm even for the basic list processing\nfunctions such as map, concat, or unique; when we explain these functions, we\nseldom use recursion explicitly as we do in functional programming. For\nexample, map is often explained as follows: the map function takes a function\nand a list and returns a list of the results of applying the function to all\nthe elements of the list.\n  This paper advocates a new programming paradigm called pattern-match-oriented\nprogramming for filling this gap. An essential ingredient of our method is\nutilizing pattern matching for non-free data types. Pattern matching for\nnon-free data types features non-linear pattern matching with backtracking and\nextensibility of pattern-matching algorithms. Several non-standard pattern\nconstructs, such as not-patterns, loop patterns, and sequential patterns, are\nderived from this pattern-matching facility. Based on that result, this paper\nintroduces many programming techniques that replace explicit recursions with an\nintuitive pattern by confining recursions inside patterns. We classify these\ntechniques as pattern-match-oriented programming design patterns.\n  These programming techniques allow us to redefine not only the most basic\nfunctions for list processing such as map, concat, or unique more elegantly\nthan the traditional functional programming style, but also more practical\nmathematical algorithms and software such as a SAT solver, computer algebra\nsystem, and database query language that we had not been able to implement\nconcisely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 18:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

A safe fluent API is the fluent API that reports incorrect\nchaining of the API methods as a type error to the API users. Although such a\nsafe property improves the productivity of its users, the construction of a\nsafe fluent API is too complicated for the developers. The generation\nalgorithms are studied to reduce the development cost of a safe fluent API. The\nstudy on the generation would benefit a number of programmers since a fluent\nAPI is a popular design in the real world.\n  Inquiry: The generation of a generic fluent API has been left untackled. A\ngeneric fluent API refers to the fluent API that provides generic methods\n(methods that contain type parameters in their definitions). The Stream API in\nJava is an example of such a generic API. The recent research on the safe\nfluent API generation rather focuses on the grammar class that the algorithm\ncan deal with for syntax checking. The key idea of the previous study is to use\nnested generics to represent a stack structure for the parser built on top of\nthe type system. In that idea, the role of a type parameter was limited to\ninternally representing a stack element of that parser on the type system. The\nlibrary developers could not use type parameters to include a generic method in\ntheir API so that the semantic constraints for their API would be statically\nchecked, for example, the type constraint on the items passed through a stream.\n  Approach: We propose an algorithm to generate a generic fluent API. Our\ntranslation algorithm is modeled as the construction of deterministic finite\nautomaton (DFA) with type parameter information. Each state of the DFA holds\ninformation about which type parameters are already bound in that state. This\ninformation is used to identify whether a method invocation in a chain newly\nbinds a type to a type parameter, or refers to a previously bound type. The\nidentification is required since a type parameter in a chain is bound at a\nparticular method invocation, and that bound type is referred to in the\nfollowing method invocations. Our algorithm constructs the DFA by analyzing the\nbinding time of type parameters and their propagation among the states in a DFA\nthat is naively constructed from the given grammar.\n  Knowledge and Importance: Our algorithm helps library developers to develop a\ngeneric fluent API. The ability to generate a generic fluent API is essential\nto bring the safe fluent API generation to the real world since the use of type\nparameters is a common technique in the library API design. By our algorithm,\nthe generation of a safe fluent API will be ready for practical use.\n  Grounding: We implemented a generator named Protocool to demonstrate our\nalgorithm. We also generated several libraries using Protocool to show the\nability and the limitations of our algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 18:56:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

A\nDomain-Specific Language (DSL) is an artificial software language tailored for\na particular application domain. Usually, DSL users are domain experts that may\nnot have a software engineering background. As a consequence, they might not be\nfamiliar with Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Thus, the development\nof tools that offer different interfaces for interacting with a DSL is\nrelevant.\n  Inquiry: However, resources available to DSL designers are limited. We would\nlike to leverage tools used to interact with general purpose languages in the\ncontext of DSLs. Computational notebooks are an example of such tools. Then,\nour main question is: What is an efficient and effective method of designing\nand implementing notebook interfaces for DSLs? By addressing this question we\nmight be able to speed up the development of DSL tools, and ease the\ninteraction between end-users and DSLs.\n  Approach: In this paper, we present Bacat\\'a, a mechanism for generating\nnotebook interfaces for DSLs in a language parametric fashion. We designed this\nmechanism in a way in which language engineers can reuse as many language\ncomponents (e.g., language processors, type checkers, code generators) as\npossible.\n  Knowledge: Our results show that notebook interfaces generated by Bacat\\'a\ncan be automatically generated with little manual configuration. There are few\nconsiderations and caveats that should be addressed by language engineers that\nrely on language design aspects. The creation of a notebook for a DSL with\nBacat\\'a becomes a matter of writing the code that wires existing language\ncomponents in the Rascal language workbench with the Jupyter platform.\n  Grounding: We evaluate Bacat\\'a by generating functional computational\nnotebook interfaces for three different non-trivial DSLs, namely: a small\nsubset of Halide (a DSL for digital image processing), SweeterJS (an extended\nversion of JavaScript), and QL (a DSL for questionnaires). Additionally, it is\nrelevant to generate notebook implementations rather than implementing them\nmanually. We measured and compared the number of Source Lines of Code (SLOCs)\nthat we reused from existing implementations of those languages.\n  Importance: The adoption of notebooks by novice-programmers and end-users has\nmade them very popular in several domains such as exploratory programming, data\nscience, data journalism, and machine learning. Why are they popular? In (data)\nscience, it is essential to make results reproducible as well as\nunderstandable. However, notebooks are only available for GPLs. This paper\nopens up the notebook metaphor for DSLs to improve the end-user experience when\ninteracting with code and to increase DSLs adoption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 18:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

We prove that this\nalgorithm has significantly improved exponential scaling compared to all prior\nquasiprobability simulators for qubits. Our second simulator is a new variant\nof the stabilizer-rank simulation algorithm, extended to work with mixed states\nand with significantly improved runtime bounds. Our third simulator trades\nprecision for speed by discarding negative quasiprobabilities. We connect each\nalgorithm's performance to a corresponding magic monotone and, by\ncomprehensively characterizing the monotones, we obtain a precise understanding\nof the simulation runtime and error bounds. Our analysis reveals a deep\nconnection between all three seemingly unrelated simulation techniques and\ntheir associated monotones.

Refining or altering existing behavior is the daily work of every\ndeveloper, but that cannot be always anticipated, and software sometimes cannot\nbe stopped. In such cases, unanticipated adaptation of running systems is of\ninterest for many scenarios, ranging from functional upgrades to on-the-fly\ndebugging or monitoring of critical applications.\n  Inquiry. A way of altering software at run time is using behavioral\nreflection, which is particularly well-suited for unanticipated adaptation of\nreal-world systems. Partial behavioral reflection is not a new idea, and for\nyears many efforts have been made to propose a practical way of expressing it.\nAll these efforts resulted in practical solutions, but which introduced a\nsemantic gap between the code that requires adaptation and the expression of\nthe partial behavior. For example, in Aspect-Oriented Programming, a pointcut\ndescription is expressed in another language, which introduces a new distance\nbetween the behavior expression (the Advice) and the source code in itself.\n  Approach. Ten years ago, the idea of closing the gap between the code and the\nexpression of the partial behavior led to the implementation of the\nReflectivity framework. Using Reflectivity, developers annotate Abstract Syntax\nTree (AST) nodes with meta-behavior which is taken into account by the compiler\nto produce behavioral variations. In this paper, we present Reflectivity, its\nAPI, its implementation and its usage in Pharo. We reflect on ten years of use\nof Reflectivity, and show how it has been used as a basic building block of\nmany innovative ideas.\n  Knowledge. Reflectivity brings a practical way of working at the AST level,\nwhich is a high-level representation of the source code manipulated by software\ndevelopers. It enables a powerful way of dynamically add and modify behavior.\nReflectivity is also a flexible mean to bridge the gap between the expression\nof the meta-behavior and the source code. This ability to apply unanticipated\nadaptation and to provide behavioral reflection led to many experiments and\nprojects during this last decade by external users. Existing work use\nReflectivity to implement reflective libraries or languages extensions,\nfeatherweight code instrumentation, dynamic software update, debugging tools\nand visualization and software analysis tools.\n  Grounding. Reflectivity is actively used in research projects. During the\npast ten years, it served as a support, either for implementation or as a\nfundamental base, for many research work including PhD theses, conference,\njournal and workshop papers. Reflectivity is now an important library of the\nPharo language, and is integrated at the heart of the platform.\n  Importance. Reflectivity exposes powerful abstractions to deal with partial\nbehavioral adaptation, while providing a mature framework for unanticipated,\nnon-intrusive and partial behavioral reflection based on AST annotation.\nFurthermore, even if Reflectivity found its home inside Pharo, it is not a pure\nSmalltalk-oriented solution. As validation over the practical use of\nReflectivity in dynamic object-oriented languages, the API has been ported to\nPython. Finally, the AST annotation feature of Reflectivity opens new\nexperimentation opportunities about the control that developers could gain on\nthe behavior of their own software.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 18:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

Fast recompilation enables cheap experimentation with changes\nto a project, as those changes can be tested quickly. Separate and incremental\ncompilation has been a topic of interest for a long time to facilitate fast\nrecompilation.\n  Inquiry: Despite the benefits of an incremental compiler, such compilers are\nusually not the default. This is because incrementalization requires\ncross-cutting, complicated, and error-prone techniques such as dependency\ntracking, caching, cache invalidation, and change detection. Especially in\ncompilers for languages with cross-module definitions and integration,\ncorrectly and efficiently implementing an incremental compiler can be a\nchallenge. Retrofitting incrementality into a compiler is even harder. We\naddress this problem by developing a compiler design approach that reuses parts\nof an existing non-incremental compiler to lower the cost of building an\nincremental compiler. It also gives an intuition into compiling\ndifficult-to-incrementalize language features through staging.\n  Approach: We use the compiler design approach presented in this paper to\ndevelop an incremental compiler for the Stratego term-rewriting language. This\nlanguage has a set of features that at first glance look incompatible with\nincremental compilation. Therefore, we treat Stratego as our critical case to\ndemonstrate the approach on. We show how this approach decomposes the original\ncompiler and has a solution to compile Stratego incrementally. The key idea on\nwhich we build our incremental compiler is to internally use an incremental\nbuild system to wire together the components we extract from the original\ncompiler.\n  Knowledge: The resulting compiler is already in use as a replacement of the\noriginal whole-program compiler. We find that the incremental build system\ninside the compiler is a crucial component of our approach. This allows a\ncompiler writer to think in multiple steps of compilation, and combine that\ninto a incremental compiler almost effortlessly. Normally, separate compilation\n\\`a la C is facilitated by an external build system, where the programmer is\nresponsible for managing dependencies between files. We reuse an existing sound\nand optimal incremental build system, and integrate its dependency tracking\ninto the compiler.\n  Grounding: The incremental compiler for Stratego is available as an artefact\nalong with this article. We evaluate it on a large Stratego project to test its\nperformance. The benchmark replays edits to the Stratego project from version\ncontrol. These benchmarks are part of the artefact, packaged as a virtual\nmachine image for easy reproducibility.\n  Importance: Although we demonstrate our design approach on the Stratego\nprogramming language, we also describe it generally throughout this paper. Many\ncurrently used programming languages have a compiler that is much slower than\nnecessary. Our design provides an approach to change this, by reusing an\nexisting compiler and making it incremental within a reasonable amount of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 18:57:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

Although language workbenches have\nsimplified the design of DSLs and extensions to general purpose languages,\nstatic analyses must still be implemented manually.\n  Inquiry: Moreover, static analyses, e.g., complexity metrics, dependency\nanalysis, and declaration-use analysis, are usually domain-dependent and cannot\nbe easily reused. Therefore, transferring existing static analyses to another\nDSL incurs a huge implementation overhead. However, this overhead is not always\nintrinsically necessary: in many cases, while the concepts of the DSL on which\na static analysis is performed are domain-specific, the underlying algorithm\nemployed in the analysis is actually domain-independent and thus can be reused\nin principle, depending on how it is specified. While current approaches either\nimplement static analyses internally or with an external Visitor, the\nimplementation is tied to the language's grammar and cannot be reused easily.\nThus far, a commonly used approach that achieves reusable static analysis\nrelies on the transformation into an intermediate representation upon which the\nanalysis is performed. This, however, entails a considerable additional\nimplementation effort.\n  Approach: To remedy this, it has been proposed to map the necessary\ndomain-specific concepts to the algorithm's domain-independent data structures,\nyet without a practical implementation and the demonstration of reuse. Thus, to\nmake static analysis reusable again, we employ relational Reference Attribute\nGrammars (RAGs) by creating such a mapping to a domain-independent overlay\nstructure using higher-order attributes.\n  Knowledge: We describe how static analysis can be specified on\nanalysis-specific data structures, how relational RAGs can help with the\nspecification, and how a mapping from the domain-specific language can be\nperformed. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a static analysis for a DSL can be\nexternalized and reused in another general purpose language.\n  Grounding: The approach was evaluated using the RAG system JastAdd. To\nillustrate reusability, we implemented two analyses with two addressed\nlanguages each: a cycle detection analysis used in a small state machine DSL\nand for detecting circular dependencies in Java types and packages, and an\nanalysis of variable shadowing, applied to both Java and the Modelica modelling\nlanguage.

Tools that highlight code locations that\ncould benefit from refactoring are thus highly desirable. The most common name\nfor such locations is \"bad code smell\". A number of tools offer such quality\nfeedback and there is a substantial body of related research. However, all\nthese tools, including those based on Machine Learning, still produce false\npositives. Every single false positive shown to the developer places a\ncognitive burden on her and should thus be avoided. The literature discusses\nthe choice of metric thresholds, the general subjectivity of such a judgment\nand the relation to conscious design choices, \"design ideas\". To examine false\npositives and the relation between bad smells and design ideas, we designed and\nconducted an exploratory case study. While previous research presented a broad\noverview, we have chosen a narrow setting to reach for even deeper insights:\nThe framework JHotDraw had been designed so thoughtfully that most smell\nwarnings are expected to be false positives. Nevertheless, the \"Law of Good\nStyle\", better known as the \"Law of Demeter\", is a rather restrictive design\nrule so that we still expected to find some potential bad smells, i.e.\nviolations of this \"Law\". This combination led to 1215 potential smells of\nwhich at most 42 are true positives. We found generic as well as specific\ndesign ideas that were traded for the smell. Our confidence in that decision\nranged from high enough to very high. We were surprised to realize that the\nsmell definition itself required the formulation of constructive design ideas.\nFinally we found some smells to be the result of the limitation of the language\nand one could introduce auxiliary constructive design ideas to compensate for\nthem. The decision whether a potential smell occurrence is actually a true\npositive was made very meticulously. For that purpose we took three qualities\nthat the smell could affect negatively into account and we discussed the result\nof the recommended refactorings. If we were convinced that we had found a false\npositive, we described the relationships with design ideas. The realization\nthat not only general design ideas but also specific design ideas have an\ninfluence on whether a potential smell is a true positive turns the problem of\nfalse positives from a scientific problem (\"What is the true definition of the\nsmell?\") to a engineering problem (\"How can we incorporate design ideas into\nsmell definitions?\"). We recommend to add adaptation points to the smell\ndefinitions. Higher layers may then adapt the smell for specific contexts.\nAfter adaptation the tool may continuously provide distinct and precise quality\nfeedback, reducing the cognitive load for the developer and preventing\nhabituation. Furthermore, the schema for the discussion of potential smells may\nbe used to elaborate more sets of true and false smell occurrences. Finally, it\nfollows that smell detection based on machine learning should also take signs\nof design ideas into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 18:59:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 19:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-08"}

Traditionally,\nthese trials are based on one type of schedule. In more recent practice,\nhowever, there is often a need to consider more than one schedule, which means\nthat in addition to the dose itself, the schedule needs to be varied in the\ntrial. Hence, the aim is finding an acceptable dose-schedule combination.\nHowever, most established methods for dose-escalation trials are designed to\nescalate the dose only and ad-hoc choices must be made to adapt these to the\nmore complicated setting of finding an acceptable dose-schedule combination. In\nthis paper, we introduce a Bayesian time-to-event model which takes explicitly\nthe dose amount and schedule into account through the use of pharmacokinetic\nprinciples. The model uses a time-varying exposure measure to account for the\nrisk of a dose-limiting toxicity over time. The dose-schedule decisions are\ninformed by an escalation with overdose control criterion. The model is\nformulated using interpretable parameters which facilitates the specification\nof priors. In a simulation study, we compared the proposed method with an\nexisting method. The simulation study demonstrates that the proposed method\nyields similar or better results compared to an existing method in terms of\nrecommending acceptable dose-schedule combinations, yet reduces the number of\npatients enrolled in most of scenarios.

Feedback is most valuable when it happens immediately,\nas defects can be corrected instantly before they become harder to fix.

While there\nare numerous static approaches that output a ranking of tests solely based on\nthe current version of a program, we focus on change-based test prioritization,\nwhich recommends tests that likely fail in response to the most recent program\nchange. The canonical approach relies on coverage data and prioritizes tests\nthat cover the changed region, but obtaining and updating coverage data is\ncostly. More recently, information retrieval techniques that exploit\noverlapping vocabulary between change and tests have proven to be powerful, yet\nlightweight.\n  In this work, we demonstrate the capabilities of information retrieval for\nprioritizing tests in dynamic programming languages using Python as example. We\ndiscuss and measure previously understudied variation points, including how\ncontextual information around a program change can be used, and design\nalternatives to the widespread \\emph{TF-IDF} retrieval model tailored to\nretrieving failing tests.\n  To obtain program changes with associated test failures, we designed a tool\nthat generates a large set of faulty changes from version history along with\ntheir test results.

We then post-process the simulated CMZ to calculate\nits spatially-dependent chemical and thermal state, producing synthetic\nemission data cubes and maps of both HI and the molecular gas tracers CO, NH3\nand HCN. We show that, as viewed from Earth, gas in the CMZ is distributed\nmainly in two parallel and elongated features extending from positive\nlongitudes and velocities to negative longitudes and velocities. The molecular\ngas emission within these two streams is not uniform, and it is mostly\nassociated to the region where gas flowing towards the Galactic Center through\nthe dust lanes collides with gas orbiting within the ring. Our simulated data\ncubes reproduce a number of features found in the observed CMZ.

This correlation between morphology and star\nformation rate should be detectable in observations of extragalactic CMZs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 19:09:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

Next, we present\na number of experiments that analyse taxonomic embeddings that have been\ntrained on a synthetic corpus that has been generated via a random walk over a\ntaxonomy. These experiments demonstrate how the properties of the synthetic\ncorpus, such as the percentage of rare words, are affected by the shape of the\nknowledge graph the corpus is generated from. Finally, we explore the\ninteractions between the relative sizes of natural and synthetic corpora on the\nperformance of embeddings when taxonomic and thematic embeddings are combined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 20:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Recent advances in machine learning to predict patient deterioration have\nintroduced the possibility of \\emph{proactive transfer} from the ward to the\nICU. In this work, we study the problem of finding \\emph{robust} patient\ntransfer policies which account for uncertainty in statistical estimates due to\ndata limitations when optimizing to improve overall patient care. We propose a\nMarkov Decision Process model to capture the evolution of patient health, where\nthe states represent a measure of patient severity. Under fairly general\nassumptions, we show that an optimal transfer policy has a threshold structure,\ni.e., that it transfers all patients above a certain severity level to the ICU\n(subject to available capacity). As model parameters are typically determined\nbased on statistical estimations from real-world data, they are inherently\nsubject to misspecification and estimation errors. We account for this\nparameter uncertainty by deriving a robust policy that optimizes the worst-case\nreward across all plausible values of the model parameters. We show that the\nrobust policy also has a threshold structure under fairly general assumptions.\nMoreover, it is more aggressive in transferring patients than the optimal\nnominal policy, which does not take into account parameter uncertainty. We\npresent computational experiments using a dataset of hospitalizations at 21\nKNPC hospitals, and present empirical evidence of the sensitivity of various\nhospital metrics (mortality, length-of-stay, average ICU occupancy) to small\nchanges in the parameters.

Recently, a congestion-based congestion control, BBR, is proposed to\npromote TCP transmission performance through better use of bandwidth. Due to\nthe superior performance of BBR, we try to boost MPTCP with it. For this\npropose, coupled congestion control should be redesigned for MPTCP, and a\nfunctional scheduler able to effectively make use of the characteristics of BBR\nmust also be developed for better performance. In this paper, we first propose\nCoupled BBR as a coupled congestion control algorithm for MPTCP to achieve high\nthroughput and stable sending rate in lossy network scenarios with guaranteed\nfairness with TCP BBR flows and balanced congestion.

Traditional softmax regression induces a\ngradient cost proportional to the number of classes $C$, which often is\nprohibitively expensive. A popular scalable softmax approximation relies on\nuniform negative sampling, which suffers from slow convergence due a poor\nsignal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we propose a simple training method for\ndrastically enhancing the gradient signal by drawing negative samples from an\nadversarial model that mimics the data distribution.

Our results reveal that the traditional\nanneal process in essence removes Fe vacancies and the additional Fe deposition\nserves as a more efficient way to achieve superconductivity. This work\nhighlights the significance of stoichiometry in the superconductivity of FeSe\nthin films and provides an easy path for superconducting samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Feb 2020 04:04:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

This is an\nundesirable quality for pulsed-radar applications since the radiated pulse will\nbe distorted. Such distortion may be detrimental to close-in sensing\napplications such as GPR. This distortion may be compensated in processing with\naccurately simulated or measured phase data. However, antenna performance may\ndeviate from that simulated or measured due to the dielectric loading of the\nground. In such cases, it may be desirable to employ a dispersion model based\non antenna design parameters which may be optimized in-situ.

For the ideal\ncodeword design in the first step, additional phase is introduced to the beam\ngain to provide extra degree of freedom. We develop a phase-shifted ideal\ncodeword design (PS-ICD) method, which is based on alternative minimization\nwith each iteration having a closed-form solution and can be extended to design\nmore general beamforming vectors with different beam patterns.

Machine Learning is one of the\neffective approaches for network traffic classification. Specifically, Deep\nLearning (DL) has attracted much attention from the researchers due to its\neffectiveness even in encrypted network traffic without compromising neither\nuser privacy nor network security. However, most of the existing models are\ncreated from closed-world datasets, thus they can only classify those existing\nclasses previously sampled and labeled. In this case, unknown classes cannot be\ncorrectly classified. To tackle this issue, an autonomous learning framework is\nproposed to effectively update DL-based traffic classification models during\nactive operations. The core of the proposed framework consists of a DL-based\nclassifier, a self-learned discriminator, and an autonomous self-labeling\nmodel. The discriminator and self-labeling process can generate new dataset\nduring active operations to support classifier update. Evaluation of the\nproposed framework is performed on an open dataset, i.e., ISCX VPN-nonVPN, and\nindependently collected data packets. The results demonstrate that the proposed\nautonomous learning framework can filter packets from unknown classes and\nprovide accurate labels.

Understanding this phenomenon of jet\nquenching is a requirement for extracting the microscopic properties of the QGP\nvia jet-tomography. STAR has recently introduced a technique called Jet\nGeometry Engineering (JGE) wherein we enforce particular selection criteria\nimposed on the jet collection, such as recoiling off a high $p_{\\rm{T}}$ hadron\ntrigger along with an additional transverse momentum threshold for jet\nconstituents in events with back-to-back di-jets. With JGE, we are able to\ncontrol the extent of energy loss ranging from quenched/imbalanced to\nrecovered/balanced di-jets. Since jet quenching is also expected to be\ndependent on the resolution/transverse-length scales with which the jet probes\nthe medium, it is necessary to perform differential measurements with a handle\non both momentum and angular scales. To quantify the angular scale within jets,\nwe present the first measurement of the jet's inherent angular structure in\nAu$+$Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = $ 200 GeV via the opening angle\nbetween the two leading sub-jets ($\\theta_{\\rm{SJ}}$).

For some applications, computational expensive and time consuming\ndata processing is inevitable for status information of messages to be\ndisplayed. Mobile edge servers are equipped with adequate computation resources\nand they are placed close to users. Thus, mobile edge computing (MEC) can be a\npromising technology to reduce AoI for computation-intensive messages. In this\npaper, we study the AoI for computation-intensive messages with MEC, and\nconsider three computing schemes: local computing, remote computing at the MEC\nserver, and partial computing, i.e., some part of computing tasks are performed\nlocally, and the rest is executed at the MEC server. Zero-wait policy is\nadopted in all three schemes. Specifically, in local computing, a new message\nis generated immediately after the previous one is revealed by computing.

With infinite queue size and\nexponentially distributed transmission time, closed-form average AoI for\nexponentially distributed computing time is derived for the three computing\nschemes. For deterministic computing time, the average AoI is analyzed\nnumerically.

The results demonstrate that the proposed\narchitecture speeds up the batch algorithms compared to the previous solutions.\nThe proposed idea applies to any HPC architecture meant for neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 17:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

Our experimental results\nsuggest that an advanced AO system with fine beam tracking, reliable beam\nstabilization, precise wavefront sensing, and accurate wavefront correction is\nnecessary to adequately correct turbulence-induced error. We also propose and\ndemonstrate different solutions to improve the performance of OAM QKD with\nturbulence, which could enable the possibility of OAM encoding in strong\nturbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 17:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Despite the exciting progress, a dedicated visualization system that\ncan dynamically capture the distance-based folding process is still lacking.\nMost molecular visualizers typically provide only a static view of a folded\nprotein conformation, but do not capture the folding process. Even among the\nselected few graphical interfaces that do adopt a dynamic perspective, none of\nthem are distance-based. Here we present PolyFold, an interactive visual\nsimulator for dynamically capturing the distance-based protein folding process\nthrough real-time rendering of a distance matrix and its compatible spatial\nconformation as it folds in an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. PolyFold\nintegrates highly convergent stochastic optimization algorithms with on-demand\ncustomizations and interactive manipulations to maximally satisfy the geometric\nconstraints imposed by a distance matrix. PolyFold is capable of simulating the\ncomplex process of protein folding even on modest personal computers, thus\nmaking it accessible to the general public for fostering citizen science.

These systems have the ability to deal with the\nlimitations of unimodal biometric systems which are vulnerable to spoofing,\nnoise, non-universality and intra-class variations. In addition, the ocular\ntraits among various biometric traits are preferably used in these recognition\nsystems. Such systems possess high distinctiveness, permanence, and performance\nwhile, technologies based on other biometric traits (fingerprints, voice etc.)\ncan be easily compromised. This work presents a novel deep learning framework\ncalled SIP-SegNet, which performs the joint semantic segmentation of ocular\ntraits (sclera, iris and pupil) in unconstrained scenarios with greater\naccuracy. The acquired images under these scenarios exhibit purkinje reflexes,\nspecular reflections, eye gaze, off-angle shots, low resolution, and various\nocclusions particularly by eyelids and eyelashes. To address these issues,\nSIP-SegNet begins with denoising the pristine image using denoising\nconvolutional neural network (DnCNN), followed by reflection removal and image\nenhancement based on contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE).\nOur proposed framework then extracts the periocular information using adaptive\nthresholding and employs the fuzzy filtering technique to suppress this\ninformation. Finally, the semantic segmentation of sclera, iris and pupil is\nachieved using the densely connected fully convolutional encoder-decoder\nnetwork.
