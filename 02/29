The body in direct contact with the wind develops a trail formed of a\nstationary Alfv\\'en wave, called an \\textit{Alfv\\'en wing}. When an element of\nwind crosses the Alfv\\'en wing, it sees a rotation of the ambient magnetic\nfield that can cause radio-wave instabilities. In the observer's reference\nframe, the waves are collimated in a very narrow range of directions, and they\nhave an extremely high intensity. A previous work, published in 2014, showed\nthat planets orbiting a pulsar can cause FRB when they pass in our line of\nsight. We predicted periodic FRB. Since then random FRB repeaters have been\ndiscovered. We present an upgrade of this theory where repeaters can be\nexplained by the interaction of smaller bodies with a pulsar wind. Considering\nthe properties of relativistic Alfv\\'en wings attached to a body in the pulsar\nwind, and taking thermal consideration into account we conduct a parametric\nstudy. We find that FRBs, including the Lorimer burst (30 Jy), can be explained\nby small size pulsar companions (1 to 10 km) between 0.03 and 1 AU from a\nhighly magnetized millisecond pulsar. Some sets of parameters are also\ncompatible with a magnetar. Our model is compatible with the high rotation\nmeasure of FRB121102. The bunched timing of the FRBs is the consequence of a\nmoderate wind turbulence. As asteroid belt composed of less than 200 bodies\nwould suffice for the FRB occurrence rate measured with FRB121102. This model,\nafter the present upgrade, is compatible with the properties discovered since\nits first publication in 2014, when repeating FRB were still unknown.

This criterion was introduced to support the identification of\nthe fireball type by empirically linking its orbital origin and composition\ncharacteristics. Additionally, it is used as an indicator of the meteoroid\ntensile strength and its ability to penetrate the atmosphere. However, the\nlevel of classification accuracy of the PE criterion depends on the ability to\nconstrain the value of the input data, retrieved from the fireball observation,\nrequired to derive the PE value. To overcome these uncertainties and achieve a\ngreater classification detail we propose a new formulation using scaling laws\nand dimensionless variables that groups all the input variables into two\nparameters that are directly obtained from the fireball observations. These two\nparameters, ${\\alpha}$ and ${\\beta}$, represent the drag and the mass loss\nrates along the luminous part of the trajectory, respectively, and are linked\nto the shape, strength, ablation efficiency, mineralogical nature of the\nprojectile, and duration of the fireball. Thus, the new formulation relies on a\nphysical basis. This work shows the mathematical equivalence between the PE\ncriterion and the logarithm of $2{\\alpha}{\\beta}$ under the same PE-criterion\nassumptions. We demonstrate that $log(2{\\alpha}{\\beta})$ offers a more general\nformulation which does not require any preliminary constraint on the meteor\nflight scenario and discuss the suitability of the new formulation for\nexpanding the classification beyond fully disintegrating fireballs to larger\nimpactors including meteorite-dropping fireballs.

In many applications, linearised form\nof the interaction is used, which allows for the system dynamics to be fully\ndescribed using a Lyapunov equation for the covariance matrix of the Wigner\nfunction. This approach, however, is problematic in situations where the\nHamiltonian becomes time dependent as is the case for systems driven at\nmultiple frequencies simultaneously. This scenario is highly relevant as it\nleads to dissipative preparation of mechanical states or backaction-evading\nmeasurements of mechanical motion. The time-dependent dynamics can be solved\nwith Floquet techniques whose application is, nevertheless, not\nstraightforward. Here, we describe a general method for combining the Lyapunov\napproach with Floquet techniques that enables us to transform the initial\ntime-dependent problem into a time-independent one, albeit in a larger Hilbert\nspace. We show how the lengthy process of applying the Floquet formalism to the\noriginal equations of motion and deriving a Lyapunov equation from their\ntime-independent form can be simplified with the use of properly defined\nFourier components of the drift matrix of the original time-dependent system.\nWe then use our formalism to comprehensively analyse dissipative generation of\nmechanical squeezing beyond the rotating wave approximation.

Such methods aim at accelerating the\nconvergence of any fixed-point iteration method by combining several iterates\nin order to generate the next one at each step. This extrapolation process is\ncharacterised by its \\emph{depth}, i.e. the number of previous iterates stored,\nwhich is a crucial parameter for the efficiency of the method. It is generally\nfixed to an empirical value. In the present work, we consider two\nparameter-driven mechanisms to let the depth vary along the iterations. In the\nfirst one, the depth grows until a certain nondegeneracy condition is no longer\nsatisfied; then the stored iterates (save for the last one) are discarded and\nthe method \"restarts\". In the second one, we adapt the depth continuously by\neliminating at each step some of the oldest, less relevant, iterates. In an\nabstract and general setting, we prove under natural assumptions the local\nconvergence and acceleration of these two adaptive Anderson--Pulay methods, and\nwe show that one can theoretically achieve a superlinear convergence rate with\neach of them. We then investigate their behaviour in quantum chemistry\ncalculations. These numerical experiments show that both adaptive variants\nexhibit a faster convergence than a standard fixed-depth scheme, and require on\naverage less computational effort per iteration.

However, there is no experimental technique which can measure phonon\nspectrum in highly-compressed near-room-temperature (NRT) superconductors to\ndate. In this paper we propose to advance McMillan's approach (1968 Phys Rev\n167 331) which utilizes the Debye temperature, T$_{\\theta}$ (an integrated\nparameter of full phonon spectrum), that we deduced by the fit of\nexperimentally measured temperature-dependent resistance data, R(T), to\nBloch-Gruneisen equation for highly-compressed black phosphorous, boron, GeAs,\nSiH$_4$, H$_x$S, D$_y$S, LaH$_x$ and LaD$_y$. By utilizing relations between\nT$_c$, Debye temperature and electron-phonon coupling strength constant,\n$\\lambda_{e-ph}$ it is possible to affirm/disprove the electron-phonon\nmechanism in given superconductors. We show that computed $\\lambda_{e-ph}$ for\nhighly-compressed black phosphorous, boron, GeAs, SiH$_4$ and for one sample of\nLaH$_{10}$ are in a good agreement with $\\lambda_{e-ph}$ values deduced from\nexperimental data.

In order to start producing sound\ntranslations and provide a meaningful training signal to each other, existing\napproaches rely on either a separate machine translation system to warm up the\niterative procedure, or some form of pre-training to initialize the weights of\nthe model. In this paper, we analyze the role that such initialization plays in\niterative back-translation. Is the behavior of the final system heavily\ndependent on it? Or does iterative back-translation converge to a similar\nsolution given any reasonable initialization? Through a series of empirical\nexperiments over a diverse set of warmup systems, we show that, although the\nquality of the initial system does affect final performance, its effect is\nrelatively small, as iterative back-translation has a strong tendency to\nconvergence to a similar solution. As such, the margin of improvement left for\nthe initialization method is narrow, suggesting that future research should\nfocus more on improving the iterative mechanism itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

Third, the (time- and space-)\nalgorithmic complexity of each iteration does not increase with the order of\nthe approximation, allowing for higher precision computations.

The quantum reservoir\neffectively transforms the single-qubit operators into complicated multi-qubit\nones which contain essential information of the system, so that the classical\nmachine learning unit may decode them appropriately. The number of runs for\nquantum computers is saved by training only the classical machine learning\nunit, and the whole model requires modest resources of quantum hardware that\nmay be implemented in current experiments.

We suggest that this flip happens if the MC's mass-to-flux\nratio, $\\mu$, is close to or below the critical value of 1. This corresponds to\na field strength around 3 - 5 $\\mu$G. In 2D, we use the Projected Rayleigh\nStatistics (PRS) to study the orientation of $\\bf{B}$. If present, the flip in\norientation occurs at $N_\\text{trans}$ $\\simeq$ 10$^{21 - 21.5}$ cm$^{-2}$,\nsimilar to the observed transition value from sub- to supercritical magnetic\nfields in the ISM. However, projection effects can reduce the power of the PRS\nmethod: Depending on the MC or LOS, the projected maps of the SILCC-Zoom\nsimulations do not always show the flip, although expected from the 3D\nmorphology. Such projection effects can explain the variety of recently\nobserved field configurations, in particular within a single MC.

Using a standard model, we\nshow that three factors can shift the Beveridge curve: reduced-form matching\nefficiency, changes in the job separation rate, and out-of-steady-state\ndynamics. We find that the shift in the Beveridge curve during and after the\nGreat Recession was due to all three factors, and each factor taken separately\nhad a large effect. Comparing the pre-2010 period to the post-2010 period, a\nfall in matching efficiency and out-of-steady-state dynamics both pushed the\ncurve upward, while the changes in the separation rate pushed the curve\ndownward. The net effect was the observed upward shift in vacancies given\nunemployment. In previous recessions changes in matching efficiency were\nrelatively unimportant, while dynamics and the separation rate had more impact.\nThus, the unusual feature of the Great Recession was the deterioration in\nmatching efficiency, while separations and dynamics have played significant,\npartially offsetting roles in most downturns. The importance of these latter\ntwo margins contrasts with much of the literature, which abstracts from one or\nboth of them. We show that these factors affect the slope of the empirical\nBeveridge curve, an important quantity in recent welfare analyses estimating\nthe natural rate of unemployment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 19:20:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

Given the\nrecent trend to outsource databases and query evaluation, and due to the\nproprietary and sometimes highly sensitivity nature of the data (e.g., in\nhealthcare), it is essential to evaluate skylines on encrypted datasets.\nSeveral research efforts acknowledged the importance of secure skyline\ncomputation, but existing solutions suffer from at least one of the following\nshortcomings: (i) they only provide ad-hoc security; (ii) they are\nprohibitively expensive; or (iii) they rely on unrealistic assumptions, such as\nthe presence of multiple non-colluding parties in the protocol.\n  Inspired from solutions for secure nearest-neighbors (NN) computation, we\nconjecture that the most secure and efficient way to compute skylines is\nthrough result materialization. However, this approach is significantly more\nchallenging for skylines than for NN queries. We exhaustively study and provide\nalgorithms for pre-computation of skyline results, and we perform an in-depth\ntheoretical analysis of this process.

Unlike previous approaches that use a\nparametric human model like skinned multi-person linear model (SMPL), and\nattempt to regress the model parameters, nonparametric approaches relax the\nheavy reliance on the parametric space. However, existing nonparametric methods\nrequire ground truth meshes as their regression target for each vertex, and\nobtaining ground truth mesh labels is very expensive. In this paper, we propose\na novel approach to learn human mesh reconstruction without any ground truth\nmeshes. This is made possible by introducing two new terms into the loss\nfunction of a graph convolutional neural network (Graph CNN). The first term is\nthe Laplacian prior that acts as a regularizer on the reconstructed mesh. The\nsecond term is the part segmentation loss that forces the projected region of\nthe reconstructed mesh to match the part segmentation. Experimental results on\nmultiple public datasets show that without using 3D ground truth meshes, the\nproposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches that\nrequire ground truth meshes for training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 20:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

To address these challenges, we\ndeveloped an inexpensive, easy-to-don sleeve that can record robust and\nrepeatable surface electromyography from 32 embedded monopolar electrodes.\nEmbedded grommets are used to consistently align the sleeve with natural skin\nmarkings (e.g., moles, freckles, scars). The sleeve can be manufactured in a\nfew hours for less than $60. Data from seven intact participants show the\nsleeve provides a signal-to-noise ratio of 14, a don-time under 11 seconds, and\nsub-centimeter precision for electrode placement. Furthermore, in a case study\nwith one intact participant, we use the sleeve to demonstrate that neural\nnetworks can provide simultaneous and proportional control of six degrees of\nfreedom, even 263 days after initial algorithm training. We also highlight that\nconsistent recordings, accumulated over time to establish a large dataset,\nsignificantly improve dexterity. These results suggest that deep learning with\na 74-layer neural network can substantially improve the dexterity and stability\nof myoelectric prosthetic control, and that deep-learning techniques can be\nreadily instantiated and further validated through inexpensive sleeves/sockets\nwith consistent recording locations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 21:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

Our learned-threshold pruning (LTP) method\nlearns per-layer thresholds via gradient descent, unlike conventional methods\nwhere they are set as input. Making thresholds trainable also makes LTP\ncomputationally efficient, hence scalable to deeper networks. For example, it\ntakes $30$ epochs for LTP to prune ResNet50 on ImageNet by a factor of $9.1$.\nThis is in contrast to other methods that search for per-layer thresholds via a\ncomputationally intensive iterative pruning and fine-tuning process.\nAdditionally, with a novel differentiable $L_0$ regularization, LTP is able to\noperate effectively on architectures with batch-normalization. This is\nimportant since $L_1$ and $L_2$ penalties lose their regularizing effect in\nnetworks with batch-normalization. Finally, LTP generates a trail of\nprogressively sparser networks from which the desired pruned network can be\npicked based on sparsity and performance requirements. These features allow LTP\nto achieve competitive compression rates on ImageNet networks such as AlexNet\n($26.4\\times$ compression with $79.1\\%$ Top-5 accuracy) and ResNet50\n($9.1\\times$ compression with $92.0\\%$ Top-5 accuracy).

In this work, we use simulations of galaxies and their GC systems\nfrom the E-MOSAICS project to explore how the present-day orbital properties of\nGCs are related to the properties of their progenitor galaxies.

Earlier mergers and larger galaxy\nmasses deposit GCs at smaller median apocentres and lower total orbital energy.\nThe orbital properties of accreted groups of GCs can therefore be used to infer\nthe properties of their progenitor galaxy, though there exists a degeneracy\nbetween galaxy mass and accretion time. Combining GC orbits with other tracers\n(GC ages, metallicities) will help to break the galaxy mass/accretion time\ndegeneracy, enabling stronger constraints on the properties of their progenitor\ngalaxy. In situ GCs generally orbit at lower energies (small apocentres) than\naccreted GCs, however they exhibit a large tail to high energies and even\nretrograde orbits (relative to the present-day disc), showing significant\noverlap with accreted GCs.

The size-luminosity correlation known for protoplanetary disks is\nrecovered for the inner disks as well, consistent with radial drift.

This constitutes a superlattice transition ($T_s$) that lowers the\nsymmetry from the high temperature centrosymmetric P4/nmm to the\nnon-centrosymmetric P$\\overline4$m2. In crystals with a large MR, a close to\nroom temperature $T_s$ is observed with $q_1$ appearing first, followed by\n$q_2$.

Finding small min-cuts for a network is essential for\nensuring the quality of service and reliability. Throughout this thesis, we use\nthe CONGEST model which is a typical message passing model used to design and\nanalyze algorithms in distributed networks. We survey various algorithmic\ntechniques in the CONGEST model and give an overview of the recent results to\nfind cuts. We also describe elegant graph theoretic ideas like cut spaces and\ncycle spaces that provide useful intuition upon which our work is built.\n  Our contribution is a novel fast algorith to find small cuts. Our algorithm\nrelies on a new characterization of trees and cuts introduced in this thesis.\nOur algorithm is built upon several new algorithmic ideas that, when coupled\nwith our characterization of trees and cuts, help us to find the required\nmin-cuts. Our novel techniques include a tree restricted semigroup function\n(TRSF), a novel sketching technique, and a layered algorithm. TRSF is defined\nwith respect to a spanning tree and is based on a commutative semigroup. This\nsimple yet powerful technique helps us to deterministically find min-cuts of\nsize one (bridges) and min-cuts of size two optimally. Our sketching technique\nsamples a small but relevant vertex set which is enough to find small min-cuts\nin certain cases. Our layered algorithm finds min-cuts in smaller sub-graphs\npivoted by nodes at different levels in a spanning tree and uses them to make\nthe decision about the min-cuts in the complete graph. This is interesting\nbecause it enables us to show that even for a global property like finding\nmin-cuts, local information can be exploited in a coordinated manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 22:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

Combining $\\tau$ with\neither $t$ or $b$ enlarges the viable parameter space owing to cancellations in\nthe EDM and in either Higgs production times decay or the total Higgs width,\nrespectively. Interestingly, in such a scenario there exists a region in\nparameter space where the SMEFT contributions to the electron EDM cancel and\ncollider signal strengths are precisely SM-like, while producing sufficient\nbaryon asymmetry. Measuring $CP$ violation in Higgs decays to $\\tau$ leptons is\nthe smoking gun for this scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 22:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

One of\nits new signatures is a large negative thermal Hall conductivity $\\kappa_{\\rm\nxy}$, which appears for dopings $p$ below the pseudogap critical doping $p^*$,\nbut whose origin is as yet unknown. Because this large $\\kappa_{\\rm xy}$ is\nobserved even in the undoped Mott insulator La$_2$CuO$_4$, it cannot come from\ncharge carriers, these being localized at $p = 0$. Here we show that the\nthermal Hall conductivity of La$_2$CuO$_4$ is roughly isotropic, being nearly\nthe same for heat transport parallel and normal to the CuO$_2$ planes, i.e.\n$\\kappa_{\\rm zy}(T) \\approx \\kappa_{\\rm xy} (T)$.

To assess the connection between features\nof a patient and this outcome, it is common to assume a proportional hazards\nmodel, and fit a proportional hazards regression (or Cox regression). To fit\nthis model, a log-concave objective function known as the ``partial\nlikelihood'' is maximized. For moderate-sized datasets, an efficient\nNewton-Raphson algorithm that leverages the structure of the objective can be\nemployed. However, in large datasets this approach has two issues: 1) The\ncomputational tricks that leverage structure can also lead to computational\ninstability; 2) The objective does not naturally decouple: Thus, if the dataset\ndoes not fit in memory, the model can be very computationally expensive to fit.\nThis additionally means that the objective is not directly amenable to\nstochastic gradient-based optimization methods.

Adversarial\nautoencoders are shown to be able to implicitly learn a robust,\nlocality-preserving hash function that generates balanced and high-quality hash\ncodes. However, the existing adversarial hashing methods are inefficient to be\nemployed for large-scale image retrieval applications. Specifically, they\nrequire an exponential number of samples to be able to generate optimal hash\ncodes and a significantly high computational cost to train. In this paper, we\nshow that the high sample-complexity requirement often results in sub-optimal\nretrieval performance of the adversarial hashing methods. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a new adversarial-autoencoder hashing approach that has a\nmuch lower sample requirement and computational cost. Specifically, by\nexploiting the desired properties of the hash function in the low-dimensional,\ndiscrete space, our method efficiently estimates a better variant of\nWasserstein distance by averaging a set of easy-to-compute one-dimensional\nWasserstein distances. The resulting hashing approach has an order-of-magnitude\nbetter sample complexity, thus better generalization property, compared to the\nother adversarial hashing methods. In addition, the computational cost is\nsignificantly reduced using our approach. We conduct experiments on several\nreal-world datasets and show that the proposed method outperforms the competing\nhashing methods, achieving up to 10% improvement over the current\nstate-of-the-art image hashing methods.

In this note, we conduct a preliminary measurement\nstudy on the latency variability of DNNs for mobile inference.

More interestingly, unlike the common belief that the\nrelative performance superiority of DNNs on one device can carry over to\nanother device and/or another level of resource contention, we highlight that a\nDNN model with a better latency performance than another model can become\noutperformed by the other model when resource contention be more severe or\nrunning on another device.

Deep quantization, which\nreduces the bitwidth of the operations (below 8 bits), offers a unique\nopportunity as it can reduce both the storage and compute requirements of the\nnetwork super-linearly. However, if not employed with diligence, this can lead\nto significant accuracy loss. Due to the strong inter-dependence between layers\nand exhibiting different characteristics across the same network, choosing an\noptimal bitwidth per layer granularity is not a straight forward. As such, deep\nquantization opens a large hyper-parameter space, the exploration of which is a\nmajor challenge.

Such a hardware constraint, known as the constant\namplitude (CA) constraint, severely limits the system performance. In this\nwork, we propose a digital and analog hybrid beamforming design that completely\neliminates the SI while substantially minimizing the losses imposed by the CA\nconstraint. Further, we develop a fully-digital beamforming design and derive\nthe upper bound for the spectral efficiency as benchmarking tools to quantify\nthe losses of our proposed hybrid design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Feb 2020 01:23:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 21:59:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 16:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

We begin by showing that exact eigenstates cannot\nbe efficiently used to extract the localisation length. We then provide a\ncomprehensive review of known LLT, and confirm that the Hamiltonian with the\neffective potential of LLT has very similar low energy eigenstates to that with\nthe physical potential. Next, we use LLT to compute the localisation length for\nvery low-energy, maximally localised eigenstates and test our method against\nexact diagonalisation. Furthermore, we propose a transmission experiment that\noptimally detects Anderson localisation, and demonstrate how one may extract a\nlength scale which is correlated with (and in general smaller than) the\nlocalisation length. In addition, we study the dimensional crossover from one\nto two dimensions, providing a new explanation to the established trends. The\nprediction of a mobility edge coming from LLT is tested by direct Schr\\\"odinger\ntime evolution and is found to be unphysical. Moreover, we investigate\nexpanding wavepackets, to find that these can be useful in detecting and\nquantifying Anderson localisation in a transmission experiment, with the only\ndisadvantage being the inability to resolve the energy dependence of the\nlocalisation length. Then, we utilise LLT to uncover a connection between the\nAnderson model for discrete disordered lattices and continuous two-dimensional\ndisordered systems, which provides powerful new insights.

While being simpler\nthan the bounding-box or pixel-level annotation, obtaining this annotation is\nstill labor-intensive and time-consuming especially for images with highly\ncrowded scenes. On the other hand, weaker annotations that only know the total\ncount of objects can be almost effortless in many practical scenarios. Thus, it\nis desirable to develop a learning method that can effectively train models\nfrom count-level annotations. To this end, this paper studies the problem of\nweakly-supervised crowd counting which learns a model from only a small amount\nof location-level annotations (fully-supervised) but a large amount of\ncount-level annotations (weakly-supervised).

However, most detection\nschemes can only detect dangling pointers and invalid them, but not provide a\ntolerance mechanism to repair the errors at runtime. Also, these techniques\nobtain and manage the metadata inefficiently with complex structures and too\nmuch scan (sweep). The goal of this paper is to use compiler instrumentation to\neliminate dangling pointers automatically and efficiently. In this paper, we\nobserve that most techniques lack accurate efficient pointer graph metadata\nmaintaining methods, so they need to scan the log to reduce the redundancy and\nsweep the whole address space to find dangling pointers. Also, they lack a\ndirect, efficiently obtaining metadata approach. The key insight of this paper\nis that a unique identifier can be used as a key to a hash or direct-map\nalgorithm. Thus, this paper maintains the same implicit identifier with each\nmemory object and its corresponding referent. Associating the unique ID with\nmetadata for memory objects, obtaining and managing the pointer graph metadata\ncan be efficiently. Therefore, with the delayed free technique adopted into\nC/C++, we present the DangKiller as a novel and lightweight dangling pointer\nelimination solution. We first demonstrate the MinFat Pointer, which can\ncalculate unique implicit ID for each object and pointer quickly, and use hash\nalgorithm to obtain metadata. Secondly, we propose the Log Cache and Log\nCompression mechanism based on the ID to decrease the redundancy of dangling\npointer candidates.

The second framework uses local\nmodification, and leads to a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate data structure for\ndynamic interval hitting set in $\\mathbb{R}^1$ with\n$\\widetilde{O}(1/\\varepsilon)$ amortized update time; in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, it\ngives $O(1)$-approximate data structures for unit-square (and quadrant) set\ncover and hitting set in the \\textit{partially} dynamic settings with\n$\\widetilde{O}(1)$ amortized update time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Feb 2020 07:47:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

However, conventional person\nre-identification can only handle RGB color images, which will fail at dark\nconditions. Thus RGB-infrared ReID (also known as Infrared-Visible ReID or\nVisible-Thermal ReID) is proposed. Apart from appearance discrepancy in\ntraditional ReID caused by illumination, pose variations and viewpoint changes,\nmodality discrepancy produced by cameras of the different spectrum also exists,\nwhich makes RGB-infrared ReID more difficult. To address this problem, we focus\non extracting the shared cross-spectrum features of different modalities. In\nthis paper, a novel multi-spectrum image generation method is proposed and the\ngenerated samples are utilized to help the network to find discriminative\ninformation for re-identifying the same person across modalities. Another\nchallenge of RGB-infrared ReID is that the intra-person (images from the same\nperson) discrepancy is often larger than the inter-person (images from\ndifferent persons) discrepancy, so a dual-subspace pairing strategy is proposed\nto alleviate this problem. Combining those two parts together, we also design a\none-stream neural network combining the aforementioned methods to extract\ncompact representations of person images, called Cross-spectrum Dual-subspace\nPairing (CDP) model. Furthermore, during the training process, we also propose\na Dynamic Hard Spectrum Mining method to automatically mine more hard samples\nfrom hard spectrum based on the current model state to further boost the\nperformance.

We consider the two most widespread methods for degrading the\neavesdropper's channel, the nullspace artificial noise (NS-AN) and random\nartificial noise (R-AN). Then, we present a lower bound on the secrecy rate and\nasymptotic performance, considering zero-forcing beamforming (ZF-BF) and\nmaximum-ratio transmission beamforming (MRT-BF). Our results reveal that even\nwhen the eavesdropper is close enough to the intercepted user, a positive\nsecrecy rate --which tends to saturation with increasing the number of BS\nantennas $N$---is possible, as long as the transmit power of eavesdropper is\nless than that of the legitimate user during channel training.

Different from mean field approaches,\nthe model explicitly conserves spatial correlations by considering stochastic\ntransitions between the channel's occupation states. The interparticle\ninteractions determine the Brownian ratchet like rectifying forces, which these\nspecies exert mutually on each other. Perfect coupling of transport emerges by\nan attractive empty channel and strong repulsive forces between particles of\nthe same species. Stochastic transitions are then confined to a subspace with\ncircular topology, which makes channel flows of both species become equivalent.\nFor opposing concentration gradients, this makes the species with the stronger\ngradient the driving, positive entropy producing one, the other is driven and\nproduces negative entropy. A differential interaction with less repulsive\nforces within particles of one species, but maintenance of this interaction for\nthe other species, adds a bypass path to this circular subspace. On this path a\nleak flow of the species with less repulsive interparticle interaction emerges,\nwhich is directed parallel to its concentration gradient, and, hence, produces\npositive entropy. Now, appropriate strong opposing concentration gradients may\nsimultaneously parallelize flow of their respective species, which makes each\nspecies produce positive entropy. The rectifying potential of the species with\nthe bypass option is diminished, which implies the existence of a gradient of\nthe other species, above which its flow and gradient are always parallel.\nConversely flow of the less coupled species may always be turned anti-parallel\nto its gradient by a sufficient strong opposing gradient of the other one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Feb 2020 13:23:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 11:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-23"}

As modern processing is\ndigital, it operates on sampled versions of the CT signals. When sampling is\napplied to a CT WSCS process, the statistics of the resulting discrete-time\n(DT) process depends on the relationship between the sampling interval and the\nperiod of the statistics of the CT process: When these two parameters have a\ncommon integer factor, then the DT process is WSCS. This situation is referred\nto as synchronous sampling. When this is not the case, which is referred to as\nasynchronous sampling, the resulting DT process is wide-sense almost\ncyclostationary (WSACS). In this work, we study the fundamental tradeoff of\nsources codes applied to sampled CT WSCS processes, namely, their\nrate-distortion function (RDF). We note that RDF characterization for the case\nof synchronous sampling directly follows from classic information-theoretic\ntools utilizing ergodicity and the law of large numbers; however, when sampling\nis asynchronous, the resulting process is not information stable. In such\ncases, commonly used information-theoretic tools are inapplicable to RDF\nanalysis, which poses a major challenge. Using the information spectrum\nframework, we show that the RDF for asynchronous sampling in the low distortion\nregime can be expressed as the limit superior of a sequence of RDFs in which\neach element corresponds to the RDF of a synchronously sampled WSCS process\n(but their limit is not guaranteed to exist). The resulting characterization\nallows us to introduce novel insights on the relationship between sampling\nsynchronization and RDF. For example, we demonstrate that, differently from\nstationary processes, small differences in the sampling rate and the sampling\ntime offset can notably affect the RDF of sampled CT WSCS processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Feb 2020 14:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Until recently, attempts to create local learning rules that avoid\nweight transport have typically failed in the large-scale learning scenarios\nwhere backpropagation shines, e.g. ImageNet categorization with deep\nconvolutional networks. Here, we investigate a recently proposed local learning\nrule that yields competitive performance with backpropagation and find that it\nis highly sensitive to metaparameter choices, requiring laborious tuning that\ndoes not transfer across network architecture. Our analysis indicates the\nunderlying mathematical reason for this instability, allowing us to identify a\nmore robust local learning rule that better transfers without metaparameter\ntuning. Nonetheless, we find a performance and stability gap between this local\nrule and backpropagation that widens with increasing model depth. We then\ninvestigate several non-local learning rules that relax the need for\ninstantaneous weight transport into a more biologically-plausible \"weight\nestimation\" process, showing that these rules match state-of-the-art\nperformance on deep networks and operate effectively in the presence of noisy\nupdates.

In order to avoid linear dependencies of localized\norbitals, the existing localization methods either constrain orbital\ntransformations to be unitary, that is, metric preserving, or, in the case of\nvariable-metric methods, fix the centers of nonorthogonal localized orbitals.\nHere, we developed a different approach to orbital localization, in which these\nconstraints are replaced with a single restriction that specifies the maximum\nallowed deviation from the orthogonality for the final set of localized\norbitals. This reformulation, which can be viewed as a generalization of\nexisting localization methods, enables one to choose the desired balance\nbetween the orthogonality and locality of the orbitals. Furthermore, the\napproach is conceptually and practically simple as it obviates the necessity in\nunitary transformations and allows to determine optimal positions of the\ncenters of nonorthogonal orbitals in a unconstrained and straightforward\nminimization procedure. It is demonstrated to produce well-localized orthogonal\nand nonorthogonal orbitals with the Berghold and Pipek-Mezey localization\nfunctions for a variety of molecules and periodic materials including large\nsystems with non-trivial bonding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Feb 2020 00:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

Automation is essential for\nenabling platforms to respond rapidly to disinformation. In this work, we\nexplore a new direction for automated detection of disinformation websites:\ninfrastructure features. Our hypothesis is that while disinformation websites\nmay be perceptually similar to authentic news websites, there may also be\nsignificant non-perceptual differences in the domain registrations, TLS/SSL\ncertificates, and web hosting configurations. Infrastructure features are\nparticularly valuable for detecting disinformation websites because they are\navailable before content goes live and reaches readers, enabling early\ndetection. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a large corpus of\nlabeled website snapshots.

Our approach uses features in pre-trained vision models with\nminimal additional processing to predict common properties transformed by\naugmentation (scale, aspect ratio, hue, saturation, contrast, and brightness).\nSurprisingly, neural network features not only predict data augmentation\ntransformations, but they predict many transformations with high accuracy.\nAfter validating that neural networks encode features corresponding to\naugmentation transformations, we show that these features are encoded in the\nearly layers of modern CNNs, though the augmentation signal fades in deeper\nlayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Feb 2020 00:42:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 18:02:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 23:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

The idea of proposing this algorithm belongs to the hunting\nbehavior of the humpback whale. However, WOA suffers from poor performance in\nthe exploitation phase and stagnates in the local best solution. Grey Wolf\nOptimization (GWO) is a very competitive algorithm comparing to other common\nmetaheuristic algorithms as it has a super performance in the exploitation\nphase while it is tested on unimodal benchmark functions. Therefore, the aim of\nthis paper is to hybridize GWO with WOA to overcome the problems. GWO can\nperform well in exploiting optimal solutions. In this paper, a hybridized WOA\nwith GWO which is called WOAGWO is presented. The proposed hybridized model\nconsists of two steps. Firstly, the hunting mechanism of GWO is embedded into\nthe WOA exploitation phase with a new condition which is related to GWO.\nSecondly, a new technique is added to the exploration phase to improve the\nsolution after each iteration. Experimentations are tested on three different\nstandard test functions which are called benchmark functions: 23 common\nfunctions, 25 CEC2005 functions and 10 CEC2019 functions. The proposed WOAGWO\nis also evaluated against original WOA, GWO and three other commonly used\nalgorithms. Results show that WOAGWO outperforms other algorithms depending on\nthe Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Finally, WOAGWO is likewise applied to solve an\nengineering problem such as pressure vessel design. Then the results prove that\nWOAGWO achieves optimum solution which is better than WOA and Fitness Dependent\nOptimizer (FDO).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 21:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}
