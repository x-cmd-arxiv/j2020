The Hilbert space of the narrow bands is\nconstructed from a pair of hybrid Wannier states with opposite Chern numbers.\nDepending on the parameters in the BM model, the DMRG in this basis determines\nthe ground state at one particle per unit cell to be either QAH state or a\nstate with no Hall effect which is nearly a product state. Based on this form,\nwe then apply the variational method to study their competition, thus\nidentifying three states: the QAH, a gapless $C_2T$ symmetric nematic, and a\ngapped $C_2T$ symmetric stripe. All three states are nearly degenerate at the\nrealistic parameters of the BM model. The single particle spectrum of the\nnematic contains either a quadratic node or two close Dirac nodes near\n$\\Gamma$. Motivated by the Landau level degeneracy found in this state, we\npropose it to be the state observed at the charge neutrality point once spin\nand valley degeneracies are restored. The optimal period for the $C_2T$ stripe\nstate is found to be $2$ unit cells. In addition, using the fact that the\ntopological charge of the nodes in the $C_2T$ nematic phase is no longer\ndescribed simply by their winding numbers once the translation symmetry is\nbroken, but rather by certain elements of a non-Abelian group that was recently\npointed out, we identify the mechanism of the gap opening within the $C_2T$\nstripe state. Although the nodes at the Fermi energy are locally stable, they\ncan be annihilated after braiding with other nodes connecting them to adjacent\n(folded) bands. Therefore, if the translation symmetry is broken, the gap at\none particle per unit cell can open even if the system preserves the $C_2T$ and\nvalley $U(1)$ symmetries, and the gap to remote bands remains open.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 16:41:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 16:54:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 12:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

For a\nhomogeneous condensate, the long-range interaction drastically alters the\ndispersion relation of the excitation, supporting both roton and maxon modes.\nRotons are typically responsible for the creation of supersolids, while maxons\nare normally dynamically unstable in BECs with dipolar interactions. We show\nthat maxon modes in the Rydberg-dressed condensate, on the contrary, are\ndynamically stable. We find that the maxon modes can be excited through an\ninteraction quench, i.e. turning on the soft-core interaction instantaneously.\nThe emergence of the maxon modes is accompanied by oscillations at high\nfrequencies in the quantum depletion, while rotons lead to much slower\noscillations. The dynamically stable excitation of the roton and maxon modes\nleads to persistent oscillations in the quantum depletion. Through a\nself-consistent Bogoliubov approach, we identify the dependence of the maxon\nmode on the soft-core interaction. Our study shows that maxon and roton modes\ncan be excited dynamically and simultaneously by quenching Rydberg-dressed\nlong-range interactions.

This raises the question of how to overcome the gap between\nsymbolic and sub-symbolic artificial intelligence. We propose a semantic world\nmodeling approach based on bottom-up object anchoring using an object-centered\nrepresentation of the world. Perceptual anchoring processes continuous\nperceptual sensor data and maintains a correspondence to a symbolic\nrepresentation. We extend the definitions of anchoring to handle multi-modal\nprobability distributions and we couple the resulting symbol anchoring system\nto a probabilistic logic reasoner for performing inference. Furthermore, we use\nstatistical relational learning to enable the anchoring framework to learn\nsymbolic knowledge in the form of a set of probabilistic logic rules of the\nworld from noisy and sub-symbolic sensor input. The resulting framework, which\ncombines perceptual anchoring and statistical relational learning, is able to\nmaintain a semantic world model of all the objects that have been perceived\nover time, while still exploiting the expressiveness of logical rules to reason\nabout the state of objects which are not directly observed through sensory\ninput data. To validate our approach we demonstrate, on the one hand, the\nability of our system to perform probabilistic reasoning over multi-modal\nprobability distributions, and on the other hand, the learning of probabilistic\nlogical rules from anchored objects produced by perceptual observations. The\nlearned logical rules are, subsequently, used to assess our proposed\nprobabilistic anchoring procedure.

Furthermore, we derived an\nexpression that relates the properties of the wave-induced cloud structures to\nobservable parameters in order to deduce the atmospheric density.\n  Numerical simulations show that the $\\rho, p, T$ variations caused by gravity\nwaves lead to an increase of the nucleation rate by up to a factor 20, and an\nincrease of the mantle growth rate by up to a factor 1.6, compared to their\nequilibrium values. An exploration of the wider parameter space shows that in\nabsolute terms, the increase in nucleation due to IGW is stronger in cooler (T\ndwarfs) and TiO2-rich sub-stellar atmospheres. The relative increase, however,\nis greater in warmer (L dwarf) and TiO2-poor atmospheres due to conditions less\nsuited for efficient nucleation at equilibrium. These variations lead to banded\nareas in which dust formation is much more pronounced, similar to the cloud\nstructures observed on Earth.\n  We show that IGW in the atmosphere of sub-stellar objects can produce banded\nclouds structures similar to that observed on Earth.

To protect a system,\na defender proactively changes the system configurations to limit the exposure\nof security vulnerabilities to potential attackers. In doing so, the defender\ncreates asymmetric uncertainty and complexity for the attackers, making it much\nharder for them to compromise the system. In practice, the defender incurs a\nswitching cost for each migration of the system configurations. The switching\ncost usually depends on both the current configuration and the following\nconfiguration. Besides, different system configurations typically require a\ndifferent amount of time for an attacker to exploit and attack. Therefore, a\ndefender must simultaneously decide both the optimal sequences of system\nconfigurations and the optimal timing for switching. In this paper, we propose\na Markov Stackelberg Game framework to precisely characterize the defender's\nspatial and temporal decision-making in the face of advanced attackers.

In this\npaper, we close this gap and show that SGD without replacement achieves a rate\nof $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{T^2}+\\frac{n^2}{T^3}\\right)$ when the sum of the\nfunctions is a quadratic, and offer a new lower bound of\n$\\Omega\\left(\\frac{n}{T^2}\\right)$ for strongly convex functions that are sums\nof smooth functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 17:37:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 18:32:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 00:11:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 17:37:19 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 01:26:54 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 14:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

In the case of\nChern-Simons axion $F(R)$ gravity there exist spin-0, spin-2 and spin-1 modes.\nAs we demonstrate, from all the gravitational waves modes of the Chern-Simons\naxion $F(R)$ gravity, only the two tensor modes are affected, while the spin-0\nand spin-1 modes are not affected at all. With regard to the two tensor modes,\nwe show that these modes propagate in a non-equivalent way, so the resulting\ntensor modes are chiral. Notably, with regard to the propagation of the spin-2\ngraviton modes, the structure of the dispersion relations becomes more\ncomplicated in comparison with the Einstein gravity with the Chern-Simons\naxion, but the resulting qualitative features of the propagating modes are not\nchanged. With regard to the spin-0 and spin-1 modes, the Chern-Simons axion\n$F(R)$ gravity contains two spin-0 modes and no vector spin-1 mode at all. We\nalso find that for the very high energy mode, both the group velocity and the\nphase velocity are proportional to the inverse of the square root of the wave\nnumber, and therefore the velocities become smaller for larger wave numbers or\neven vanish in the limit that the wave number goes to infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 17:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

It is shown that particles do not modify the building-up\nand the decay of the superfluid Kolmogorov turbulent regime. It is observed\nthat almost the totality of particles remains trapped inside quantum vortices,\nalthough they are occasionally detached and recaptured. The statistics of this\nprocess are presented and discussed. The particle Lagrangian dynamics is also\nstudied. At large time scales, the velocity spectrum of particles is\nreminiscent of a classical Lagrangian turbulent behavior.

We apply this study to the class of\nunimodal maps that give rise to equivalent bifurcation diagrams. We use the\nclassical logistic map to illustrate the main results of this paper: there are\nvisibility patterns in each cascade of the bifurcation diagram, converging at\nthe onset of chaos.\n  The visibility pattern of a periodic time series is generated from elementary\nblocks of visibility in a recursive way. This rule of recurrence applies to all\nperiodic-doubling cascades. Within a particular window, as the growth parameter\n$r$ varies and each period doubles, these blocks are recurrently embedded\nforming the visibility pattern for each period. In the limit, at the onset of\nchaos, an infinite pattern of visibility appears containing all visibility\npatterns of the periodic time series of the cascade.\n  We have seen that these visibility patterns have specific properties: (i) the\nsize of the elementary blocks depends on the period of the time series, (ii)\ncertain time series sharing the same periodicity can have different elementary\nblocks and, therefore, different visibility patterns, (iii) since the 2-period\nand 3-period windows are unique, the respective elementary blocks, $ \\{2\\} $\nand $ \\{2 \\, 3\\}$, are also unique and thus, their visibility patterns.

This work\nintroduces the concept of intentional nonlocality as a fundamental mechanism to\ndesign passive elastic metasurfaces capable of an exceptionally broadband\noperating range. The nonlocal behavior is achieved by exploiting nonlocal\nforces, conceptually akin to long-range interactions in nonlocal material\nmicrostructures, between subsets of resonant unit cells forming the\nmetasurface. These long-range forces are obtained via carefully crafted\nflexible elements whose specific geometry and local dynamics are designed to\ncreate remarkably complex transfer functions between multiple units. The\nresulting nonlocal coupling forces enable achieving phase gradient profiles\nthat are function of the wavenumber of the incident wave.The identification of\nrelevant design parameters and the assessment of their impact on performance\nare explored via a combination of semi-analytical and numerical models. The\nnonlocal metasurface concept is tested, both numerically and experimentally, by\nembedding a total-internal-reflection design in a thin plate waveguide.

However, GAN training presents many\nchallenges, notably it can be very resource-intensive. A potential weakness in\nGANs is that it requires a lot of data for successful training and data\ncollection can be an expensive process. Typically, the corrective feedback from\ndiscriminator DNNs to generator DNNs (namely, the discriminator's assessment of\nthe generated example) is calculated using only one real-numbered value (loss).\nBy contrast, we propose a new class of GAN we refer to as xAI-GAN that\nleverages recent advances in explainable AI (xAI) systems to provide a \"richer\"\nform of corrective feedback from discriminators to generators. Specifically, we\nmodify the gradient descent process using xAI systems that specify the reason\nas to why the discriminator made the classification it did, thus providing the\n\"richer\" corrective feedback that helps the generator to better fool the\ndiscriminator. Using our approach, we observe xAI-GANs provide an improvement\nof up to 23.18% in the quality of generated images on both MNIST and FMNIST\ndatasets over standard GANs as measured by Frechet Inception Distance (FID). We\nfurther compare xAI-GAN trained on 20% of the data with standard GAN trained on\n100% of data on the CIFAR10 dataset and find that xAI-GAN still shows an\nimprovement in FID score. Further, we compare our work with Differentiable\nAugmentation - which has been shown to make GANs data-efficient - and show that\nxAI-GANs outperform GANs trained on Differentiable Augmentation. Moreover, both\ntechniques can be combined to produce even better results. Finally, we argue\nthat xAI-GAN enables users greater control over how models learn than standard\nGANs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 18:38:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 17:14:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 15:59:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

In this work, we aim to study the benefits associated with such a\nco-location using large-eddy simulation (LES) and analytical wake models. In\nthis regard, small-scale vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) in triangular\nclusters are deployed within a finite-size wind farm consisting of\nhorizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs). Wake flow within the wind farm and the\neffect of VAWTs on the overall wind-farm efficiency are investigated and\nquantified. The results show that the optimal deployment of small-scale VAWTs\nhas a negligible impact on the performance of HAWT arrays while increasing the\ntotal power production. For the particular cases considered here, the power\noutput of the co-located wind farm increases up to 21% compared to the baseline\ncase in which only the HAWTs are present. Also, by comparing to the LES\nresults, it is shown that the analytical framework proposed here is able to\naccurately predict the power production of wind farms including both HAWTs and\nVAWTs. Next, as a real-world application, potential benefits of deploying\nsmall-scale VAWTs inside the Horns Rev 1 wind farm are explored for various\nwind directions using the calibrated wake model. The results show potential for\nabout an 18% increase in the wind-farm power production, averaged over all wind\ndirections, for a particular VAWT layout investigated in this study.

However, due to the cancellation of opposite\nfield polarities, polarimetry captures only a tiny fraction of the magnetic\nflux and cannot assess the overall stellar surface magnetic field if it is\ndominated by a small-scale component. Analysis of Zeeman broadening in\nhigh-resolution intensity spectra can reveal these hidden complex magnetic\nfields. Historically, there were very few attempts to obtain such measurements\nfor G dwarf stars due to the difficulty of disentangling Zeeman effect from\nother broadening mechanisms affecting spectral lines. Here we developed a new\nmagnetic field diagnostic method based on relative Zeeman intensification of\noptical atomic lines with different magnetic sensitivity. Using this technique\nwe obtained 78 field strength measurements for 15 Sun-like stars, including\nsome of the best-studied young solar twins. We find that the average magnetic\nfield strength $Bf$ drops from 1.3-2.0 kG in stars younger than about 120 Myr\nto 0.2-0.8 kG in older stars. The mean field strength shows a clear correlation\nwith the Rossby number and with the coronal and chromospheric emission\nindicators. Our results suggest that magnetic regions have roughly the same\nlocal field strength $B\\approx3.2$ kG in all stars, with the filling factor $f$\nof these regions systematically increasing with stellar activity. Comparing our\nresults with the spectropolarimetric analyses of global magnetic fields in the\nsame stars, we find that ZDI recovers about 1% of the total magnetic field\nenergy in the most active stars.

Even though it is one of the key problems in Bioinformatics,\nit is generally lacking major theoretical advances. Its hardness stems both\nfrom practical issues (size and errors of real data), and from the fact that\nproblem formulations inherently admit multiple solutions. Given these, at their\ncore, most state-of-the-art assemblers are based on finding non-branching paths\n(unitigs) in an assembly graph. If one defines a genome assembly solution as a\nclosed arc-covering walk of the graph, then unitigs appear in all solutions,\nbeing thus safe partial solutions. All all such safe walks were recently\ncharacterized as omnitigs, leading to the first safe and complete genome\nassembly algorithm. Even if omnitig finding was improved to quadratic time, it\nremained open whether the crucial linear-time feature of finding unitigs can be\nattained with omnitigs.\n  We describe a surprising $O(m)$-time algorithm to identify all maximal\nomnitigs of a graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ arcs, notwithstanding the existence\nof families of graphs with $\\Theta(mn)$ total maximal omnitig size. This is\nbased on the discovery of a family of walks (macrotigs) with the property that\nall the non-trivial omnitigs are univocal extensions of subwalks of a macrotig,\nwith two consequences: (1) A linear-time output-sensitive algorithm enumerating\nall maximal omnitigs. (2) A compact $O(m)$ representation of all maximal\nomnitigs, which allows, e.g., for $O(m)$-time computation of various statistics\non them.\n  Our results close a long-standing theoretical question inspired by practical\ngenome assemblers, originating with the use of unitigs in 1995.

The\nanalysis holds even when a quadratic time algorithm is used to sort the keys in\neach bucket. We show how to obtain linear time guarantees on the running time\nof Bucket Sort that hold with very high probability. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the asymptotic behavior of the exponent in the upper tail\nprobability of the running time of Bucket Sort. We consider large additive\ndeviations from the expectation, of the form $cn$ for large enough (constant)\n$c$, where $n$ is the number of keys that are sorted.\n  Our analysis shows a profound difference between variants of Bucket Sort that\nuse a quadratic time algorithm within each bucket and variants that use a\n$\\Theta(b\\log b)$ time algorithm for sorting $b$ keys in a bucket.

It is not yet fully clear how to\nlink density fluctuations with interactions in a disordered hyperuniform\nsystem. Interactions between superconducting vortices are very sensitive to\nvortex pinning, to the crystal structure of the superconductor and to the value\nof the magnetic field. This creates lattices with different degrees of\ndisorder.

Passive prostheses to replace the\nossicular chain mainly rely on piston-like titanium and/or hydroxyapatite\ndevices, which in the long term suffer from extrusion. Although the basic shape\nof such devices always consists of a base for contact with the eardrum and a\nstem to have mechanical connection with the residual bony structures, a\nplethora of topologies have been proposed, mainly to help surgical positioning.\nIn this work, we optimize the topology of a total ossicular replacement\nprosthesis, by maximizing the global stiffness and under the smallest possible\nvolume constraint that ensures material continuity. This investigation\noptimizes the prosthesis topology in response to static displacement loads with\namplitudes that normally occur during sound stimulation in a frequency range\nbetween 100 Hz and 10 kHz. Following earlier studies, we discuss how the\npresence and arrangement of holes on the surface of the prosthesis plate in\ncontact with the umbo affect the overall geometry. Finally, we validate the\ndesigns through a finite-element model, in which we assess the prosthesis\nperformance upon dynamic sound pressure loads by considering four different\nconstitutive materials: titanium, cortical bone, silk, and\ncollagen/hydroxyapatite. The results show that the selected prostheses present,\nalmost independently of their constitutive material, a vibroacustic behavior\nclose to that of the native ossicular chain, with a slight almost constant\npositive shift that reaches a maximum of 5 dB close to 1 kHz.

We consider two different criteria for the\nconnectivity constraint of the aerial vehicle which leads to two different\nscenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that the maximum continuous time\nduration that the aerial vehicle is out of the coverage of the ground base\nstations (GBSs) is limited to a given threshold. In the second scenario,\nhowever, we assume that the total time periods that the aerial vehicle is not\ncovered by the GBSs is restricted. Based on these two constraints, we formulate\ntwo trajectory optimization problems. To solve these non-convex problems, we\nuse an approach based on the double Q-learning method which is a model-free\nreinforcement learning technique and unlike the existing algorithms does not\nneed perfect knowledge of the environment.

Simulation results show that although\nour algorithm does not require prior information of the environment, it works\nwell and shows near optimal performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 22:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

In particular, a channel\nestimation approach is developed to measure the channel state information (CSI)\nin real-time. First, for a perfect CSI scenario, the precoding transmission of\nthe BS and the reflection coefficient of the IR are jointly optimized, via an\niterative approach, so as to maximize the sum of downlink rates towards\nmultiple users. Next, in the imperfect CSI scenario, a distributional\nreinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed to learn the optimal IR\nreflection and maximize the expectation of downlink capacity. In order to model\nthe transmission rate's probability distribution, a learning algorithm, based\non quantile regression (QR), is developed, and the proposed QR-DRL method is\nproved to converge to a stable distribution of downlink transmission rate.\nSimulation results show that, in the error-free CSI scenario, the proposed\napproach yields over 30% and 2-fold increase in the downlink sum-rate, compared\nwith a fixed IR reflection scheme and direct transmission scheme, respectively.\nSimulation results also show that by deploying more IR elements, the downlink\nsum-rate can be significantly improved. However, as the number of IR components\nincreases, more time is required for channel estimation, and the slope of\nincrease in the IR-aided transmission rate will become smaller. Furthermore,\nunder limited knowledge of CSI, simulation results show that the proposed\nQR-DRL method, which learns a full distribution of the downlink rate, yields a\nbetter prediction accuracy and improves the downlink rate by 10% for online\ndeployments, compared with a Q-learning baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 22:18:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 04:43:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2021 20:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

Additionally, a large number of cycle-cut nodes and the\niterative nature of MB-DPOP further exacerbate the pathology. As a result,\nMB-DPOP could suffer from huge coordination overheads and cannot scale up well.\nTherefore, we present RMB-DPOP which incorporates several novel mechanisms to\nreduce redundant inferences and improve the scalability of MB-DPOP. First,\nusing the independence among the cycle-cut nodes in different branches, we\ndistribute the enumeration of instantiations into different branches whereby\nthe number of nonconcurrent instantiations reduces significantly and each\nbranch can perform memory bounded inference asynchronously. Then, taking the\ntopology into the consideration, we propose an iterative allocation mechanism\nto choose the cycle-cut nodes that cover a maximum of active nodes in a cluster\nand break ties according to their relative positions in a pseudo-tree. Finally,\na caching mechanism is proposed to further reduce unnecessary inferences when\nthe historical results are compatible with the current instantiations.

A promising explanation for\nthese puzzles is the distorting effects of magnetic activity and starspots on\nthe structure of active stars. To assist the community in evaluating this\nhypothesis, we present the Stellar Parameters Of Tracks with Starspots (SPOTS)\nmodels, a grid of solar-metallicity stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones\nwhich include a treatment of the structural effects of starspots. The models\nrange from 0.1-1.3\\msun and from spot-less to a surface covering fraction of\n85\\%, and are evolved from the pre-main sequence to the red giant branch (or\n15~Gyr). We also produce two-temperature synthetic colors for our models using\nempirically-calibrated color tables. We describe the physical ingredients\nincluded in the SPOTS models and compare their predictions to other modern\nevolution codes. Finally, we apply these models to several open questions in\nthe field of active stars, including the radii of young eclipsing binaries, the\ncolor scale of pre-main sequence stars, and the existence of sub-subgiants,\ndemonstrating that our models can explain many peculiar features of active\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 03:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

LoRaWAN\nadoption is driven by its simplified network architecture, air interface, and\nmedium access. The physical layer, known as LoRa, provides quasi-orthogonal\nvirtual channels through spreading factors (SFs) and time-power capture gains.\nHowever, the adopted pure ALOHA access mechanism suffers, in terms of\nscalability, under the same-channel same-SF transmissions from a large number\nof devices. In this paper, our objective is to explore access mechanisms\nbeyond-ALOHA for LoRaWAN. Using recent results on time- and power-capture\neffects of LoRa, we develop a unified model for the comparative study of other\nchoices, i.e., slotted ALOHA and carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA). The\nmodel includes the necessary design parameters of these access mechanisms, such\nas guard time and synchronization accuracy for slotted ALOHA, carrier sensing\nthreshold for CSMA. It also accounts for the spatial interaction of devices in\nannular-shaped regions, characteristic of LoRa, for CSMA. The performance\nderived from the model in terms of coverage probability, channel throughput,\nand energy efficiency are validated using Monte-Carlo simulations. Our analysis\nshows that slotted ALOHA indeed has higher reliability than pure ALOHA but at\nthe cost of lower energy efficiency for low device densities. Whereas, CSMA\noutperforms slotted ALOHA at smaller SFs in terms of reliability and energy\nefficiency, with its performance degrading to pure ALOHA at higher SFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 08:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

While\nthe former policy (i.e. target policy) is rewarding but in-expressive (in most\ncases, deterministic), doing well in the latter task, in contrast, requires an\nexpressive policy (i.e. behavior policy) that offers guided and effective\nexploration. Contrary to most methods that make a trade-off between optimality\nand expressiveness, disentangled frameworks explicitly decouple the two\nobjectives, which each is dealt with by a distinct separate policy. Although\nbeing able to freely design and optimize the two policies with respect to their\nown objectives, naively disentangling them can lead to inefficient learning or\nstability issues. To mitigate this problem, our proposed method Analogous\nDisentangled Actor-Critic (ADAC) designs analogous pairs of actors and critics.\nSpecifically, ADAC leverages a key property about Stein variational gradient\ndescent (SVGD) to constraint the expressive energy-based behavior policy with\nrespect to the target one for effective exploration.

However, besides up-sampling degradation, the\nvarious artifacts brought from compression make super-resolution problem more\ndifficult to solve. The straightforward solution is to integrate the artifact\nremoval techniques before super-resolution. However, some helpful features may\nbe removed together, degrading the super-resolution performance. To address\nthis problem, we proposed an end-to-end restoration-reconstruction deep neural\nnetwork (RR-DnCNN) using the degradation-aware technique, which entirely solves\ndegradation from compression and sub-sampling. Besides, we proved that the\ncompression degradation produced by Random Access configuration is rich enough\nto cover other degradation types, such as Low Delay P and All Intra, for\ntraining. Since the straightforward network RR-DnCNN with many layers as a\nchain has poor learning capability suffering from the gradient vanishing\nproblem, we redesign the network architecture to let reconstruction leverages\nthe captured features from restoration using up-sampling skip connections.

This operation is often realized by\nflooding, where the source nodes send a message containing the information to\nall neighbors. Each node receiving the message for the first time forwards it\nto all other neighbors. A stateless variant of flooding for synchronous systems\nis called amnesiac flooding. In this case, every time a node receives a\nmessage, it forwards it to those neighbors, from which it did not receive the\nmessage in the current round. The algorithm is oblivious and therefore scales\nvery well. Stateless protocols are advantageous in high volume applications,\nincreasing performance by removing the load caused by retention of session\ninformation and by providing crash tolerance. In this paper we analyze the\ntermination time of amnesiac flooding. We define the (k,c)-flooding problem,\nwhich aims at finding a set $S$ of size $k$, such that amnesiac flooding when\nstarted concurrently by all nodes of $S$ terminates in a minimal number of\nrounds. We prove that this problem is NP-complete. We provide sharp upper and\nlower bounds for the time complexity of amnesiac flooding and reveal a\ndiscrepancy between bipartite and non-bipartite graphs. All results are based\non the insight, that for every non-bipartite graph there exists a bipartite\ngraph such that the execution of amnesiac flooding on both graphs is strongly\ncorrelated. This construction considerably simplifies existing proofs for\namnesiac flooding and allows to analyze the (k,c)-flooding problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 09:11:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 08:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 09:47:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 15:03:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

Our discussion is based on the decentralized parallel\nstochastic gradient descent (D-PSGD), which is one of the state-of-the-art\nalgorithms for decentralized learning. The main contribution of this paper is\nto raise a novel open question for decentralized learning on wireless systems:\nthere is a possibility that the density of a network topology significantly\ninfluences the runtime performance of D-PSGD. In general, it is difficult to\nguarantee delay-free communications without any communication deterioration in\nreal wireless network systems because of path loss and multi-path fading. These\nfactors significantly degrade the runtime performance of D-PSGD. To alleviate\nsuch problems, we first analyze the runtime performance of D-PSGD by\nconsidering real wireless systems. This analysis yields the key insights that\ndense network topology (1) does not significantly gain the training accuracy of\nD-PSGD compared to sparse one, and (2) strongly degrades the runtime\nperformance because this setting generally requires to utilize a low-rate\ntransmission. Based on these findings, we propose a novel communication\nstrategy, in which each node estimates optimal transmission rates such that\ncommunication time during the D-PSGD optimization is minimized under the\nconstraint of network density, which is characterized by radio propagation\nproperty. The proposed strategy enables to improve the runtime performance of\nD-PSGD in wireless systems. Numerical simulations reveal that the proposed\nstrategy is capable of enhancing the runtime performance of D-PSGD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 09:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

In this study, we propose a label-guided learning framework\nLguidedLearn for text representation and classification. Our method is novel\nbut simple that we only insert a label-guided encoding layer into the commonly\nused text representation learning schemas. That label-guided layer performs\nlabel-based attentive encoding to map the universal text embedding (encoded by\na contextual information learner) into different label spaces, resulting in\nlabel-wise embeddings. In our proposed framework, the label-guided layer can be\neasily and directly applied with a contextual encoding method to perform\njointly learning. Text information is encoded based on both the local\ncontextual information and the global label clues. Therefore, the obtained text\nembeddings are more robust and discriminative for text classification.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets to illustrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 10:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

Our aim is to obtain new regularity indicators for problems in 2D\nand apply them to a class of ``adaptive filtered'' schemes for first order\nevolutive Hamilton-Jacobi equations. According to the usual procedure, filtered\nschemes are obtained by a simple coupling of a high-order scheme and a monotone\nscheme. The mixture is governed by a filter function $F$ and by a switching\nparameter $\\varepsilon^n=\\varepsilon^n({\\Delta t,\\Delta x})>0$ which goes to 0\nas $(\\Delta t,\\Delta x)$ is going to 0. The adaptivity is related to the\nsmoothness indicators and allows to tune automatically the switching parameter\n$\\varepsilon^n_j$ in time and space. Several numerical tests on critical\nsituations in 1D and 2D are presented and confirm the effectiveness of the\nproposed indicators and the efficiency of our scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 10:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

To remain competitive, logistics and e-commerce companies are\nexploring new modes as supplements to traditional home delivery, one of which\nis the self-service parcel locker. This paper studies a parcel locker location\nproblem where a company plans to introduce the locker service by locating\nlocker facilities to attract customers. The objective is to maximize the\nprofit, accounting for the revenue and the cost of facilities. To estimate the\nrevenue, we use the threshold Luce model (TLM) to predict customers' likelihood\nof using the locker service. We then propose a combinatorial optimization model\nand develop exact solution methodologies that are practically implementable\naccording to our extensive computational experiments. In effect, our modeling\nframework generalizes the traditional facility location problems based on the\nbinomial logit model (BNL) and the multinomial logit model (MNL), both of which\nimpose strong and strict assumptions on the customer's choice sets. That is,\nthey assume that the choice sets will either contain only one facility or all\nfacilities. In our numerical experiment, we demonstrate that using the BNL and\nthe MNL in the locker location problem could lead to, respectively, pessimistic\nand optimistic revenue estimation. Consequently, the suggested location\ndecisions will be either conservative or aggressive. Our proposed model, by\ncontrast, can effectively relax these assumptions. Our results also reveal that\nthe aggressive decision due to the use of the MNL will incur an unnecessarily\nhigh facility cost that cannot be compensated by the additional revenue,\nleading to profit loss that can be significant in various scenarios.

We\ndevelop a compact routing scheme for $DG(V)$. The routing scheme preprocesses\n$DG(V)$ by assigning a label $l(v)$ to every site $v$ in $V$. After that, for\nany two sites $s$ and $t$, the scheme must be able to route a packet from $s$\nto $t$ as follows: given the label of a current vertex $r$ (initially, $r=s$)\nand the label of the target vertex $t$, the scheme determines a neighbor $r'$\nof $r$. Then, the packet is forwarded to $r'$, and the process continues until\nthe packet reaches its desired target $t$. The resulting path between the\nsource $s$ and the target $t$ is called the routing path of $s$ and $t$. The\nstretch of the routing scheme is the maximum ratio of the total Euclidean\nlength of the routing path and of the shortest path in $DG(V)$, between any two\nsites $s, t \\in V$. We show that for any given $\\varepsilon>0$, we can\nconstruct a routing scheme for $DG(V)$ with diameter $D$ that achieves stretch\n$1+\\varepsilon$ and label size $O(\\log D\\log^3n/\\log\\log n)$ (the constant in\nthe $O$-Notation depends on $\\varepsilon$). In the past, several routing\nschemes for unit disk graphs have been proposed. Our scheme is the first one to\nachieve poly-logarithmic label size and arbitrarily small stretch without\nstoring any additional information in the packet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 13:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

Split graphs are graphs that\nadmit a partition of the vertex set into cliques that can be arranged in a star\nstructure, the leaves of which are of size one. Well-partitioned chordal graphs\nare a generalization of this concept in the following two ways. First, the\ncliques in the partition can be arranged in a tree structure, and second, each\nclique is of arbitrary size. We provide a characterization of well-partitioned\nchordal graphs by forbidden induced subgraphs, and give a polynomial-time\nalgorithm that given any graph, either finds an obstruction, or outputs a\npartition of its vertex set that asserts that the graph is well-partitioned\nchordal. We demonstrate the algorithmic use of this graph class by showing that\ntwo variants of the problem of finding pairwise disjoint paths between k given\npairs of vertices is in FPT parameterized by k on well-partitioned chordal\ngraphs, while on chordal graphs, these problems are only known to be in XP.\nFrom the other end, we observe that there are problems that are polynomial-time\nsolvable on split graphs, but become NP-complete on well-partitioned chordal\ngraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 14:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

Fast and efficient semantic\nsegmentation methods are needed to match the strong computational and temporal\nrestrictions of many of these real-world applications.\n  This work presents 3D-MiniNet, a novel approach for LIDAR semantic\nsegmentation that combines 3D and 2D learning layers. It first learns a 2D\nrepresentation from the raw points through a novel projection which extracts\nlocal and global information from the 3D data. This representation is fed to an\nefficient 2D Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) that produces a 2D\nsemantic segmentation.

Such variations have been extensively studied for the Sun. Recent\nplanet-hunting space telescopes allowed measuring brightness variations in\nhundred thousands of other stars. The new data posed the question of how\ntypical is the Sun as a variable star. Putting solar variability into the\nstellar context suffers, however, from the bias of solar observations being\nmade from its near-equatorial plane, whereas stars are observed at all possible\ninclinations. We model solar brightness variations at timescales from days to\nyears as they would be observed at different inclinations. In particular, we\nconsider the effect of the inclination on the power spectrum of solar\nbrightness variations. The variations are calculated in several passbands\nroutinely used for stellar measurements. We employ the Surface Flux Transport\nModel (SFTM) to simulate the time-dependent spatial distribution of magnetic\nfeatures on both near- and far-sides of the Sun. This distribution is then used\nto calculate solar brightness variations following the SATIRE (Spectral And\nTotal Irradiance REconstruction) approach. We have quantified the effect of the\ninclination on solar brightness variability at timescales down to a day. Thus,\nour results allow making solar brightness records directly comparable to those\nobtained by the planet-hunting space telescopes.

We consider a general concurrency language\nmodel, where concurrent objects interact by asynchronous method calls and\nfutures.

The approach is based on the notion of a security wrapper, which\nencloses an object or a component and controls its interactions with the\nenvironment. A wrapper is a mechanism added by the run-time system to provide\nprotection of an insecure component according to some security policies. The\nsecurity policies of a wrapper are formalized based on a notion of security\nlevels. At run-time, future components will be wrapped upon need, while only\nobjects of unsafe classes will be wrapped, using static checking to limit the\nnumber of unsafe classes and thereby reducing run-time overhead.

We\ndiscuss a general formalism which allows rocket-free maneuvers to be understood\nwithout constructing detailed interior models. A spacecraft's interior is\nabstracted to the specification of a quadrupole moment, and in some cases, it\nis only a single eigenvalue of that moment which is relevant. For orbits around\na spherically-symmetric mass, we show that appropriately varying the relevant\neigenvalue allows the energy and eccentricity of an orbit to be increased or\ndecreased and its apsides to be rotated arbitrarily. Strategies are identified\nwhich optimize these maneuvers. In other contexts, we show that extended-body\neffects can be used to stabilize orbits which would otherwise be unstable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 14:54:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 10:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

Furthermore, we introduce the scaled dot-product between values in the\nself-attention module as the new deep self-attention knowledge, in addition to\nthe attention distributions (i.e., the scaled dot-product of queries and keys)\nthat have been used in existing works. Moreover, we show that introducing a\nteacher assistant (Mirzadeh et al., 2019) also helps the distillation of large\npre-trained Transformer models. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nmonolingual model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different parameter\nsize of student models. In particular, it retains more than 99% accuracy on\nSQuAD 2.0 and several GLUE benchmark tasks using 50% of the Transformer\nparameters and computations of the teacher model. We also obtain competitive\nresults in applying deep self-attention distillation to multilingual\npre-trained models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 15:21:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 02:53:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

Designing trials to reduce treatment duration is important in\nseveral therapeutic areas, including TB and antibiotics. We recently proposed a\nnew randomised trial design to overcome some of the limitations of standard\ntwo-arm non-inferiority trials. This DURATIONS design involves randomising\npatients to a number of duration arms, and modelling the so-called\nduration-response curve. This article investigates the operating\ncharacteristics (type-1 and type-2 errors) of different statistical methods of\ndrawing inference from the estimated curve. Methods. Our first estimation\ntarget is the shortest duration non-inferior to the control (maximum) duration\nwithin a specific risk difference margin. We compare different methods of\nestimating this quantity, including using model confidence bands, the delta\nmethod and bootstrap. We then explore the generalisability of results to\nestimation targets which focus on absolute event rates, risk ratio and gradient\nof the curve. Results. We show through simulations that, in most scenarios and\nfor most of the estimation targets, using the bootstrap to estimate variability\naround the target duration leads to good results for DURATIONS\ndesign-appropriate quantities analogous to power and type-1 error. Using model\nconfidence bands is not recommended, while the delta method leads to inflated\ntype-1 error in some scenarios, particularly when the optimal duration is very\nclose to one of the randomised durations. Conclusions. Using the bootstrap to\nestimate the optimal duration in a DURATIONS design has good operating\ncharacteristics in a wide range of scenarios, and can be used with confidence\nby researchers wishing to design a DURATIONS trial to reduce treatment\nduration. Uncertainty around several different targets can be estimated with\nthis bootstrap approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 15:28:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

Secondly, to enhance detailed representation for each semantic\nregion, the \"Semantic Adversarial Branch\" is designed to learn from dynamically\ngenerated semantic-occluded samples during training. Meanwhile, we introduce\n\"Semantic Fusion Branch\" to filter out irrelevant noises by selectively fusing\nsemantic region information sequentially. To further improve feature diversity,\nwe introduce a novel loss function \"Semantic Diversity Loss\" to remove\nredundant overlaps across learned semantic representations. State-of-the-art\nperformance has been achieved on three benchmarks by large margins.\nSpecifically, the mAP score is improved by 6% and 5% on the most challenging\nCUHK03-L and CUHK03-D benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 15:43:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 02:37:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 May 2020 07:48:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 02:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

Two sharp transitions at TN1 ~ 42 K and TN2 ~ 36 K have\nbeen observed in the static and dynamic magnetization measurements, coinciding\nwith the heat capacity data. In order to confirm the origin of the observed\nphase transitions and the magnetic ground state, microscopic evidences are\npresented here. An initial indication of long-range magnetic ordering comes\nfrom a sharp drop in the muon initial asymmetry and a peak in the relaxation\nrate near TN1. NPD confirms that the magnetic ground state of Sr2YbRuO6\nconsists of an antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure with interpenetrating lattices\nof parallel Yb3+ and Ru5+ moments lying in the ab-plane and adopting a A-type\nAFM structure. Intriguingly, a small but remarkable change is observed in the\nlong-range ordering parameters at TN2 confirming the presence of a weak spin\nreorientation (i.e. change in spin configuration) transition of Ru and Yb\nmoments, as well as a change in the magnetic moment evolution of the Yb3+ spins\nat TN2. The temperature dependent behaviour of the Yb3+ and Ru5+ moments\nsuggests that the 4d-electrons of Ru5+ play a dominating role in stabilizing\nthe long range ordered magnetic ground state in the double perovskite Sr2YbRuO6\nwhereas only the Yb3+ moments show an arrest at TN2. The observed magnetic\nstructure and the presence of a ferromagnetic interaction between Ru- and Yb-\nions are explained with use of the Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson (GKA) rules.\nPossible reasons for the presence of the second magnetic phase transition and\nof a compensation point in the magnetization data are linked to competing\nmechanisms of magnetic anisotropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 15:50:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 17:08:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 21:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

For Prandtl numbers from 1--5 we find\nthat the longest-lived rings occur for intermediate Prandtl numbers, with a\nRossby number dependence. Finally, we find that the constant evaporative\nheat-flux conditions imposed in the experiments are essential in sustaining the\nrings and in maintaining the vortices that form in consequence of the ring\nbreakdown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 20:06:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 10:31:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

It serves as a prototypical example of a chaotic system and has\nnumerous applications in astrophysics. Generically, the motion is\nnon-integrable and susceptible to disintegration, and for negative total energy\nthe decay outcome is a free body flying apart from a binary. Since Poincar\\'e,\nthe problem is known to be chaotic and is believed to lack a general\ndeterministic solution. Instead, decades ago a statistical solution was marked\nas a goal. Yet, despite considerable progress, all extant approaches display\ntwo flaws. First, probability was equated with phase space volume, thereby\nignoring the fact that significant regions of phase space describe regular\nmotion, including post-decay motion. Secondly and relatedly, an adjustable\nparameter, the strong interaction region, which is a sort of cutoff, was a\ncentral ingredient of the theory.\n  This paper introduces remedies and presents for the first time a statistical\nprediction of decay rates, in addition to outcomes. Based on an analogy with a\nparticle moving within a leaky container, the statistical distribution is\npresented in an exactly factorized form. One factor is the flux of phase-space\nvolume, rather than the volume itself, and it is given in a cutoff-independent\nclosed-form. The other factors are the chaotic absorptivity and the regularized\nphase space volume. The situation is analogous to Kirchhoff's law of thermal\nradiation, also known as greybody radiation. In addition, an equation system\nfor the time evolution of the statistical distribution is introduced; it\ndescribes the decay rate statistics while accounting for sub-escape excursions.\nEarly numerical tests indicate a leap in accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 23:51:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2020 09:26:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 15:52:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 21:04:40 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 15:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

The proposed framework employs a nonlinear model-based state\nobserver, which combines a nonlinear finite element model of a building and\nglobal acceleration measurements to estimate the time history of seismic\nresponse at all degrees of freedom of the model. This includes displacements,\nelement forces, and plastic deformations in all structural members. The\nestimated seismic response is then used to 1) estimate inter-story drifts and\ndetermine the post-earthquake re-occupancy classification of the building based\non performance-based criteria, 2) compare the estimated demands with code-based\ncapacity and reconstruct element-by-element demand-to-capacity ratios and 3)\nreconstruct element-level normalized energy dissipation and ductility.

Notably, the state-of-the-art projected\ngradient descent (PGD)-based training method has been shown to be universally\nand reliably effective in defending against adversarial inputs. This robustness\napproach uses PGD as a reliable and universal \"first-order adversary\". However,\nthe behaviour of such optimisation has not been studied in the light of a\nfundamentally different class of attacks called backdoors. In this paper, we\nstudy how to inject and defend against backdoor attacks for robust models\ntrained using PGD-based robust optimisation. We demonstrate that these models\nare susceptible to backdoor attacks. Subsequently, we observe that backdoors\nare reflected in the feature representation of such models. Then, this\nobservation is leveraged to detect such backdoor-infected models via a\ndetection technique called AEGIS. Specifically, given a robust Deep Neural\nNetwork (DNN) that is trained using PGD-based first-order adversarial training\napproach, AEGIS uses feature clustering to effectively detect whether such DNNs\nare backdoor-infected or clean.\n  In our evaluation of several visible and hidden backdoor triggers on major\nclassification tasks using CIFAR-10, MNIST and FMNIST datasets, AEGIS\neffectively detects PGD-trained robust DNNs infected with backdoors. AEGIS\ndetects such backdoor-infected models with 91.6% accuracy (11 out of 12 tested\nmodels), without any false positives. Furthermore, AEGIS detects the targeted\nclass in the backdoor-infected model with a reasonably low (11.1%) false\npositive rate.

In a white-box\nattack, these perturbations are generally learned for deep models that operate\non RGB images and, hence, the perturbations are equally distributed in the RGB\ncolor space. In this paper, we show that the adversarial perturbations prevail\nin the Y-channel of the YCbCr space. Our finding is motivated from the fact\nthat the human vision and deep models are more responsive to shape and texture\nrather than color. Based on our finding, we propose a defense against\nadversarial images. Our defence, coined ResUpNet, removes perturbations only\nfrom the Y-channel by exploiting ResNet features in an upsampling framework\nwithout the need for a bottleneck. At the final stage, the untouched\nCbCr-channels are combined with the refined Y-channel to restore the clean\nimage. Note that ResUpNet is model agnostic as it does not modify the DNN\nstructure. ResUpNet is trained end-to-end in Pytorch and the results are\ncompared to existing defence techniques in the input transformation category.\nOur results show that our approach achieves the best balance between defence\nagainst adversarial attacks such as FGSM, PGD and DDN and maintaining the\noriginal accuracies of VGG-16, ResNet50 and DenseNet121 on clean images.
