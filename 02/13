In agreement with\nprevious studies, we find that for carbon-oxygen core masses 28Msun<\nM_CO<30.5Msun the explosions are not strong enough to affect the surface. With\nincreasing mass, they first cause large radial expansion\n(30.5Msun<M_CO<31.4Msun), and finally, also mass ejection episodes\n(M_CO>31.4Msun).

We show by experiments that the TT-MMK method is usually more\nreliable computationally, less sensitive to tuning parameters, and gives higher\nprediction accuracy in the SVM classification when benchmarked against other\nstate-of-the-art techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 16:35:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 16:33:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 16:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

One of those tasks is called Visual Question Answering (VQA). A VQA\nsystem must take an image and a free-form, open-ended natural language question\nabout the image, and produce a natural language answer as the output. Such a\ntask has drawn great attention from the scientific community, which generated a\nplethora of approaches that aim to improve the VQA predictive accuracy. Most of\nthem comprise three major components: (i) independent representation learning\nof images and questions; (ii) feature fusion so the model can use information\nfrom both sources to answer visual questions; and (iii) the generation of the\ncorrect answer in natural language. With so many approaches being recently\nintroduced, it became unclear the real contribution of each component for the\nultimate performance of the model. The main goal of this paper is to provide a\ncomprehensive analysis regarding the impact of each component in VQA models.\nOur extensive set of experiments cover both visual and textual elements, as\nwell as the combination of these representations in form of fusion and\nattention mechanisms. Our major contribution is to identify core components for\ntraining VQA models so as to maximize their predictive performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 17:25:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 01:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

Cyclic\ndominance, a non-transitive setup comprising at least three strategies wherein\nthe first strategy overrules the second which overrules the third which, in\nturn, overrules the first strategy, is known to maintain bio-diversity, drive\ncompetition between bacterial strains, and preserve cooperation in social\ndilemmas. Here, we present a novel route to cyclic dominance in voluntary\nsocial dilemmas by adding to the traditional mix of cooperators, defectors, and\nloners, a fourth player type, risk-averse hedgers, who enact tit-for-tat upon\npaying a hedging cost to avoid being exploited. When this cost is sufficiently\nsmall, cooperators, defectors, and hedgers enter a loop of cyclic dominance\nthat preserves cooperation even under the most adverse conditions. In contrast,\nwhen the hedging cost is large, hedgers disappear, consequently reverting to\nthe traditional interplay of cooperators, defectors, and loners. In the interim\nregion of hedging costs, complex evolutionary dynamics ensues, prompting\ntransitions between states with two, three, or four competing strategies. Our\nresults thus reveal that voluntary participation is but one pathway to\nsustained cooperation via cyclic dominance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 17:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-05"}

Dynamic trees are a fundamental building block of a large\nnumber of graph algorithms. Although traditionally studied in the single-update\nsetting, dynamic algorithms capable of supporting batches of updates are\nincreasingly relevant today due to the emergence of rapidly evolving dynamic\ndatasets. Since processing updates on a single processor is often unrealistic\nfor large batches of updates, designing parallel batch-dynamic algorithms that\nachieve provably low span is important for many applications. In this work, we\ndesign the first work-efficient parallel batch-dynamic algorithm for dynamic\ntrees that is capable of supporting both path queries and subtree queries, as\nwell as a variety of non-local queries. To achieve this, we propose a framework\nfor algorithmically dynamizing static round-synchronous algorithms that allows\nus to obtain parallel batch-dynamic algorithms with good bounds on their work\nand span. In our framework, the algorithm designer can apply the technique to\nany suitably defined static algorithm. We then obtain theoretical guarantees\nfor algorithms in our framework by defining the notion of a computation\ndistance between two executions of the underlying algorithm.\n  Our dynamic trees algorithm is obtained by applying our dynamization\nframework to the parallel tree contraction algorithm of Miller and Reif, and\nthen performing a novel analysis of the computation distance of this algorithm\nunder batch updates.

While it is often possible to approximate the input-output\nrelations of deep neural networks with a few human-understandable rules, the\ndiscovery of the double descent phenomena suggests that such approximations do\nnot accurately capture the mechanism by which deep neural networks work. Double\ndescent indicates that deep neural networks typically operate by smoothly\ninterpolating between data points rather than by extracting a few high level\nrules. As a result, neural networks trained on complex real world data are\ninherently hard to interpret and prone to failure if asked to extrapolate. To\nshow how we might be able to trust AI despite these problems we introduce the\nconcept of self-explaining AI.

Recent work has determined the correct inner boundary in\nEulerian simulations. But in quasi-Lagrangian simulations (e.g., SPH, moving\nmesh, and mesh-less), where the inner boundary is modeled by removing mass\nwithin a finite zone, the inner density profile typically becomes anomalously\ndepleted.

It produces no\nspurious density depletions and is independent of the mass removal rate,\nprovided that the disk is adequately resolved and that the mass removal rate is\nnot so extreme as to trigger instabilities. This \"torque-free\" mass removal\ntechnique permits the use of quasi-Lagrangian codes to simulate viscously\nevolving disks, while including a variety of additional effects.

We investigate the two fundamental\nassumptions of the turbulence in obtaining grain collisional velocities -- the\nkinetic energy spectrum and the turbulence autocorrelation time -- in the\ncontext of the turbulence generated by the magneto-rotational instability\n(MRI). We carry out numerical simulations of the MRI as well as driven\nturbulence, for a range of physical and numerical parameters. We find that the\nconvergence of the turbulence $\\alpha$-parameter does not necessarily imply the\nconvergence of the energy spectrum. The MRI turbulence is largely solenoidal,\nfor which we observe a persistent kinetic energy spectrum of $k^{-4/3}$. The\nsame is obtained for solenoidal driven turbulence with and without magnetic\nfield, over more than 1 dex near the dissipation scale. This power-law slope\nappears to be converged in terms of numerical resolution, and to be due to the\nbottleneck effect. The kinetic energy in the MRI turbulence peaks at the\nfastest growing mode of the MRI. In contrast, the magnetic energy peaks at the\ndissipation scale. The magnetic energy spectrum in the MRI turbulence does not\nshow a clear power-law range, and is almost constant over approximately 1 dex\nnear the dissipation scale. The turbulence autocorrelation time is nearly\nconstant at large scales, limited by the shearing timescale, and shows a\npower-law drop close to $k^{-1}$ at small scales, with a slope steeper than\nthat of the eddy crossing time.

In the Standard Model, the\nHiggs vacuum expectation value (vev) vanishes and electroweak symmetry gets\nrestored at temperatures above $\\sim 160$ GeV due to the Higgs field\ninteractions with the high-temperature plasma. It was however shown that new\nlight singlet scalar fields may change this behaviour. The key feature is the\nnon-standard dependence on the Higgs vev of the new particles mass which can\nvanish at large Higgs vev, inducing a negative correction to the Higgs thermal\nmass, leading to electroweak symmetry non-restoration at high temperature. We\nshow that such an effect can also be induced by new singlet fermions which on\nthe other hand have the advantage of not producing unstable directions in the\nscalar potential at tree level, nor bringing additional severe hierarchy\nproblems.

For\nsome specific highly structured quantum codes, Bombin has shown that\nsingle-shot fault-tolerant quantum error correction is possible using only r\nmeasurements. In this work, we demonstrate that fault-tolerant quantum error\ncorrection can be achieved using $O(d \\log(d))$ measurements for any code with\ndistance $d \\geq \\Omega(n^\\alpha)$ for some constant $\\alpha > 0$. Moreover, we\nprove the existence of a sub-single-shot fault-tolerant quantum error\ncorrection scheme using fewer than r measurements. In some cases, the number of\nparity check measurements required for fault-tolerant quantum error correction\nis exponentially smaller than the number of parity checks defining the code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 19:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Therefore, the development of new techniques to reduce\nthe nasty effects of label noise in semi-supervised learning is a vital issue.\nRecently, a graph-based semi-supervised learning approach based on Particle\ncompetition and cooperation was developed. In this model, particles walk in the\ngraphs constructed from the data sets. Competition takes place among particles\nrepresenting different class labels, while the cooperation occurs among\nparticles with the same label. This paper presents a new particle competition\nand cooperation algorithm, specifically designed to increase the robustness to\nthe presence of label noise, improving its label noise tolerance. Different\nfrom other methods, the proposed one does not require a separate technique to\ndeal with label noise. It performs classification of unlabeled nodes and\nreclassification of the nodes affected by label noise in a unique process.\nComputer simulations show the classification accuracy of the proposed method\nwhen applied to some artificial and real-world data sets, in which we introduce\nincreasing amounts of label noise. The classification accuracy is compared to\nthose achieved by previous particle competition and cooperation algorithms and\nother representative graph-based semi-supervised learning methods using the\nsame scenarios.

This is quintessentially captured in\nthe attractive Hubbard model, a simple theoretical model where the competition\ncan be directly tuned. In previous studies by the current authors, it has been\nsuggested that the Hubbard model maps to an $SO(3)$ non-linear sigma model,\nwhere the phase competition becomes manifest. In this article, we rigorously\ndemonstrate this mapping and use it to study thermal disordering of a\nsupersolid. Starting with the attractive Hubbard model in the presence of an\norbital field, we take the limit of strong coupling where a pseudospin\ndescription emerges. The in-plane pseudospin components represent\nsuperconducting pairing while the out-of-plane component encodes charge density\nwave order. We obtain an effective spin-$1/2$ Hamiltonian with ferromagnetic\nin-plane couplings and antiferromagnetic z-z couplings. In addition, the\norbital field gives rise to a textured Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that\nhas the same periodicity as the magnetic unit cell. In order to examine the\nnature of ordering in this spin model, we consider it in the classical limit.\nWe assume slowly varying fields, leading to the $SO(3)$ non-linear sigma model\ndescription. As an application of these ideas, we study the nature of ordering\nusing simulated annealing and classical Monte Carlo simulations. The ground\nstate represents a supersolid with coexisting superconductivity and charge\norder. It can be viewed as a `meron crystal', a regular arrangement of\nsuperconducting vortices with charge-ordered cores. The coherent overlap of\ncore regions gives rise to coherent long-ranged charge order. As the\ntemperature is raised, this charge order is lost via a sharp phase transition\nin the Ising universality class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 20:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

In this work, we employ our developed large-scale\nparallel, first-principles simulation tool (ArchNLO) to explore second-order\nnonlinear optical properties of a typical family of organic-inorganic hybrid\nhalide perovskites, CH3NH3MX3 (M= Ge, Sn, Pb; X=Cl, Br, I). We find that these\nhybrid perovskites exhibit second harmonic generation and linear electro-optic\neffect. The nonlinear optical effects are strongly influenced by the types and\npositions of cations/anions and corresponding band gaps. Particularly, the\ndistorted cubic phase, which is essentially triclinic, of CH3NH3SnI3 shows\nsignificant second harmonic generation and electro-optic effect, which are\ncomparable with those widely used materials, such as GaAs. These second-order\noptical properties of organic-inorganic hybrid halide perovskites and their\nlow-temperature, solution-based fabrication pave the way for achieving and\nimplementing nonlinear optical devices with low cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 20:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-14"}

This mechanism takes into full account the\ncurrent state of the system as represented by the graph, and builds upon a\ndiffusion process that captures how the information flows on the graph. The\ngraph topology is not assumed to be known a priori, but depends dynamically on\nthe agents' observations, and is learnt concurrently with the attention\nmechanism and policy in an end-to-end fashion. Our empirical results show that\nCDC is able to learn effective collaborative policies and can over-perform\ncompeting learning algorithms on cooperative navigation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 20:58:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 20:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 2021 13:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 16:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

Injected Ar pellets are observed to ablate more intensely and\npromptly as Te rises. At high Te, the observed ablation exceeds predictions\nfrom published thermal ablation models. Simultaneously, the thermal quench (TQ)\nis observed to significantly shorten with increasing Te -- a surprising result.\nWhile the reason for the shorter TQ is not yet understood, candidate mechanisms\ninclude: insufficiently accurate thermal ablation models, enhanced ablation\ndriven by the seed RE population, or significant parallel heat transport along\nstochastic fields. Kinetic modeling that self-consistently treats the plasma\ncooling via radiation, the induced electric field, and the formation of the\nseed RE is performed. Including the combined effect of the inherent dependence\nof hot-tail RE seeding on Te together with the shortened TQ, modeling recovers\nthe progression towards near-complete conversion of the pre-disruption current\nto RE current as Te rises. Measurement of the HXR spectrum during the early\ncurrent quench (CQ) reveals a trend of decreasing energy with pre-disruption\nTe. At the very highest Te ($\\approx$ 12 keV), $\\approx$ 100% conversion of the\nthermal current to runaway current is found.

In a geometric context, it provides a way\nto measure the contribution of a geometric object in a set towards some\nfunction on the set. Recently, Cabello and Chan (SoCG 2019) presented\nalgorithms for computing Shapley values for a number of functions for point\nsets in the plane. More formally, a coalition game consists of a set of players\n$N$ and a characteristic function $v: 2^N \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with $v(\\emptyset) =\n0$. Let $\\pi$ be a uniformly random permutation of $N$, and $P_N(\\pi, i)$ be\nthe set of players in $N$ that appear before player $i$ in the permutation\n$\\pi$. The Shapley value of the game is defined to be $\\phi(i) =\n\\mathbb{E}_\\pi[v(P_N(\\pi, i) \\cup \\{i\\}) - v(P_N(\\pi, i))]$. More intuitively,\nthe Shapley value represents the impact of player $i$'s appearance over all\ninsertion orders. We present an algorithm to compute Shapley values in 3-D,\nwhere we treat points as players and use the mean width of the convex hull as\nthe characteristic function. Our algorithm runs in $O(n^3\\log^2{n})$ time and\n$O(n)$ space. Our approach is based on a new data structure for a variant of\nthe dynamic convolution problem $(u, v, p)$, where we want to answer $u\\cdot v$\ndynamically. Our data structure supports updating $u$ at position $p$,\nincrementing and decrementing $p$ and rotating $v$ by $1$. We present a data\nstructure that supports $n$ operations in $O(n\\log^2{n})$ time and $O(n)$\nspace. Moreover, the same approach can be used to compute the Shapley values\nfor the mean volume of the convex hull projection onto a uniformly random $(d -\n2)$-subspace in $O(n^d\\log^2{n})$ time and $O(n)$ space for a point set in\n$d$-dimensional space ($d \\geq 3$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 21:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-14"}

For coupled Van der\nPol oscillators (and in fact, other oscillators as well) the delay can produce\ntransitions from amplitude death(AD) or oscillation death (OD) to Hopf\nbifurcation-induced periodic behavior, with the delayed limit cycle shrinking\nor growing as the delay is varied towards or away from the bifurcation point\nrespectively. The transition from AD to OD is mediated here via a pitchfork\nbifurcation, as seen earlier for other couplings as well. Also, the cyclically\ncoupled undelayed van der Pol system here is already in a state of AD/OD, and\nintroducing the delay allows both oscillations and AD/OD as the delay parameter\nis varied. This is in contrast to other limit cycle systems, where diffusive\ncoupling alone does not result in the onset of AD/OD. For systems where the\nindividual oscillators are chaotic, such as a Sprott oscillator system or a\ncoupled van der Pol-Rayleigh system with parametric forcing, the delay may\nproduce AD/OD (as in the Sprott case), with the AD to OD transition now\noccurring via a transcritical bifurcation instead. However, this may not be\npossible, and the delay might just vary the attractor shape. In either of these\nsituations however, increased delay strength tends to cause the system to have\nsimpler behavior, streamlining the shape of the attractor, or shrinking it in\ncases with oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 23:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-14"}

Epoch-GD) proposed by Hazan and Kale\n(2011) was deemed a breakthrough for stochastic strongly convex minimization,\nwhich achieves the optimal convergence rate of $O(1/T)$ with $T$ iterative\nupdates for the {\\it objective gap}. However, its extension to solving\nstochastic min-max problems with strong convexity and strong concavity still\nremains open, and it is still unclear whether a fast rate of $O(1/T)$ for the\n{\\it duality gap} is achievable for stochastic min-max optimization under\nstrong convexity and strong concavity. Although some recent studies have\nproposed stochastic algorithms with fast convergence rates for min-max\nproblems, they require additional assumptions about the problem, e.g.,\nsmoothness, bi-linear structure, etc. In this paper, we bridge this gap by\nproviding a sharp analysis of epoch-wise stochastic gradient descent ascent\nmethod (referred to as Epoch-GDA) for solving strongly convex strongly concave\n(SCSC) min-max problems, without imposing any additional assumption about\nsmoothness or the function's structure. To the best of our knowledge, our\nresult is the first one that shows Epoch-GDA can achieve the optimal rate of\n$O(1/T)$ for the duality gap of general SCSC min-max problems. We emphasize\nthat such generalization of Epoch-GD for strongly convex minimization problems\nto Epoch-GDA for SCSC min-max problems is non-trivial and requires novel\ntechnical analysis. Moreover, we notice that the key lemma can also be used for\nproving the convergence of Epoch-GDA for weakly-convex strongly-concave min-max\nproblems, leading to a nearly optimal complexity without resorting to\nsmoothness or other structural conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 02:16:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 09:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-18"}

Linear stability analysis of the systems and conditions\nfor Hopf bifurcation which initiates oscillations are investigated, including\nderiving the normal form at bifurcation, and deducing the stability of the\nresulting limit cycle attractor. The value of the delay parameter $a=a_{Hopf}$\nat Hopf bifurcation picks out the onset of Amplitude Death(AD) in all three\nsystems, with oscillations at larger values (corresponding to weaker delay). In\nthe Landau-Stuart system, the Hopf-generated limit cycles for $a>a_{Hopf}$ turn\nout to be remarkably stable under very large variations of all other system\nparameters beyond the Hopf bifurcation point, and do not undergo further\nsymmetry breaking, cyclic-fold, flip, transcritical or Neimark-Sacker\nbifurcations.

However,\nplanning an efficient, dynamic, and 3D deployment of UAVs in adaptation to\ndynamically and spatially varying ground users is a highly complicated problem\ndue to the complexity in air-to-ground channels and interference among UAVs. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel distributed 3D deployment method for UAV-BSs in\na downlink network for on-demand coverage. Our method consists mainly of the\nfollowing two parts: sensing-aided crowd density estimation and distributed\npush-sum algorithm. The first part estimates the ground user density from its\nobservation through on-ground sensors, thereby allowing us to avoid the\ncomputationally intensive process of obtaining the positions of all the ground\nusers. On the basis of the estimated user density, in the second part, each UAV\ndynamically updates its 3D position in collaboration with its neighboring UAVs\nfor maximizing the total coverage. We prove the convergence of our distributed\nalgorithm by employing a distributed push-sum algorithm framework. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that our method can improve the overall coverage with a\nlimited number of ground sensors.

Our model\nsuccessfully reproduces the observed dust mass function at redshift z = 0 and\nthe observed scaling relations for dust across a wide range of redshifts. We\nfind that the dust mass content in the present Universe is mainly produced via\ngrain growth in the interstellar medium (ISM).

The shift of the significant production channel for dust\ncharacterises the scaling relations of dust-to-gas (DTG) and dust-to-metal\n(DTM) ratios. In galaxies where the grain growth dominates, we find positive\ncorrelations for DTG and DTM ratios with both metallicity and stellar mass. On\nthe other hand, in galaxies where dust is produced primarily via condensation,\nwe find negative or no correlation for DTM and DTG ratios with either\nmetallicity or stellar mass.

In order\nto overcome the above problem, we propose a novel hypergraph optimization based\nmodel fitting (HOMF) method to construct a simple but effective hypergraph.\nSpecifically, HOMF includes two main parts: an adaptive inlier estimation\nalgorithm for vertex optimization and an iterative hyperedge optimization\nalgorithm for hyperedge optimization. The proposed method is highly efficient,\nand it can obtain accurate model fitting results within a few iterations.\nMoreover, HOMF can then directly apply spectral clustering, to achieve good\nfitting performance. Extensive experimental results show that HOMF outperforms\nseveral state-of-the-art model fitting methods on both synthetic data and real\nimages, especially in sampling efficiency and in handling data with severe\noutliers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 05:07:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-14"}

Various mathematical techniques allow\nus to generate knowledge regarding individual behaviour, which can be analysed\nto obtain predictions about the ultimate survival or extinction of the\npopulation. A common model employed to describe population dynamics is the\nlattice-based random walk model with crowding (exclusion). This model can\nincorporate behaviour such as birth, death and movement, while including\nnatural phenomena such as finite size effects. Performing sufficiently many\nrealisations of the random walk model to extract representative population\nbehaviour is computationally intensive. Therefore, continuum approximations of\nrandom walk models are routinely employed. However, standard continuum\napproximations are notoriously incapable of making accurate predictions about\npopulation extinction. Here, we develop a new continuum approximation, the\nstate space diffusion approximation, which explicitly accounts for population\nextinction. Predictions from our approximation faithfully capture the behaviour\nin the random walk model, and provides additional information compared to\nstandard approximations.

This paper introduces a general such approach, called\nEvolutionary Surrogate-Assisted Prescription, or ESP. The surrogate is, for\nexample, a random forest or a neural network trained with gradient descent, and\nthe strategy is a neural network that is evolved to maximize the predictions of\nthe surrogate model. ESP is further extended in this paper to sequential\ndecision-making tasks, which makes it possible to evaluate the framework in\nreinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks. Because the majority of evaluations are\ndone on the surrogate, ESP is more sample efficient, has lower variance, and\nlower regret than standard RL approaches. Surprisingly, its solutions are also\nbetter because both the surrogate and the strategy network regularize the\ndecision-making behavior.

In particular, when\nprocessors communicate by message passing, fake messages may be placed in\ncommunication links by an adversary. When the number of such fake messages is\nunknown, self-stabilization may require huge resources: (a) generic solutions\n(a.k.a. data link protocols) require unbounded resources, which makes them\nunrealistic to deploy and (b) specific solutions (e.g., census or tree\nconstruction) require $O(n\\log n)$ or $O(\\Delta\\log n)$ bits of memory per\nnode, where $n$ denotes the network size and $\\Delta$ its maximum degree, which\nmay prevent scalability.\n  We investigate the possibility of resource efficient self-stabilizing\nprotocols in this context. Specifically, we present a self-stabilizing protocol\nfor $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring in any n-node graph, under the asynchronous\nmessage-passing model. It is deterministic, it converges in $O(k\\Delta n^2\\log\nn)$ message exchanges, where $k$ is the bound of the link capacity in terms of\nnumber of messages, and it uses messages on $O(\\log\\log n+\\log\\Delta)$ bits\nwith a memory of $O(\\Delta\\log\\Delta+\\log\\log n)$ bits at each node. The\nresource consumption of our protocol is thus almost oblivious to the number of\nnodes, enabling scalability. Moreover, a striking property of our protocol is\nthat the nodes do not need to know the number, or any bound on the number of\nmessages initially present in each communication link of the initial\n(potentially corrupted) network configuration. This permits our protocol to\nhandle any future network with unknown message capacity communication links. A\nkey building block of our coloring scheme is a spanning directed acyclic graph\nconstruction, that is of independent interest, and can serve as a useful tool\nfor solving other tasks in this challenging setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 08:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-14"}

Using this result it is shown that within the electroweak model large\namplitude variations of $A_{\\mu}$ for fixed $Z_{\\mu}$ in a superposition of\nthese fields cancel the $AAAA$ and $AAAZ$ graphs, thereby removing an apparent\nobstacle to the model's non-perturbative quantization. A negative paramagnetic\nterm in the remainder opposes the effective action's growth for such\nvariations. Its calculation requires knowledge of the degeneracy of the bound\nstates of a charged fermion in the four-dimensional magnetic fields generated\nby the functional measure of $A_{\\mu}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 08:19:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

A range of physical effects can be\ntransferred to the realms of photonics by creating artificial photonic lattices\nemulating these two-dimensional materials. Here, exciton-polaritons in\nsemiconductor microcavities offer an exciting opportunity to study a\npart-light, part-matter quantum fluid of light in a complex lattice potential.\nIn this paper, we study exciton-polaritons in a two-dimensional Lieb lattice of\nburied optical traps. The $S$ and $P_{xy}$ photonic orbitals of such a Lieb\nlattice give rise to the formation of two flatbands which are of greatest\ninterest for the distortion-free storage of compact localized states. By using\na well controlled etch-and-overgrowth technique, we manage to control the\ntrapping as well as the site couplings with great precision. This allows us to\nspectroscopically monitor the flatness of the flatbands across the full\nBrillouin zone. Furthermore, we demonstrate experimentally that these flatbands\ncan be directly populated by condensation under non-resonant laser excitation.\nFinally, using this advanced device approach we demonstrate resonant and\ndeterministic excitation of flatband modes in transmission geometry. Our\nfindings establish the exciton-polariton systems as a highly controllable,\noptical many-body system to study flatband effects and for distortion-free\nstorage of compact localized states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 09:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Since\nkeyphrase extraction is able to facilitate the management, categorization, and\nretrieval of information, it has received much attention in recent years.

Two-step ranking approach is based on feature engineering, which is\nlabor intensive and domain dependent. Sequence labeling is not able to tackle\noverlapping phrases.

While the temporal evolution of the population size\nis a simple birth-death process, observing the lifetime and trajectories of all\nindividuals calls for a new paradigm. To formalise this framework, we introduce\nspatial birth-death-move processes, where the birth and death dynamics depends\non the current spatial configuration of the population and where individuals\ncan move during their lifetime according to a continuous Markov process with\npossible interactions.We consider non-parametric kernel estimators of their\nbirth and death intensity functions.

Among the\nvarious processes that contribute to the removal of `old-polarity' toroidal\nmagnetic flux is the emergence of flux loops forming bipolar regions at the\nsolar surface. We quantify the loss of subsurface net toroidal flux by this\nprocess. To this end, we determine the contribution of an individual emerging\nbipolar loop and show that it is unaffected by surface flux transport after\nemergence. Together with the linearity of the diffusion process this means that\nthe total flux loss can be obtained by adding the contributions of all emerging\nbipolar magnetic regions. The resulting total loss rate of net toroidal flux\namounts to 1.3 X 10^{15} Mx/s during activity maxima and 6.1 X 10^{14} Mx/s\nduring activity minima, to which ephemeral regions contribute about 90% and\n97%, respectively. This rate is consistent with the observationally inferred\nloss rate of toroidal flux into interplanetary space and corresponds to a decay\ntime of the subsurface toroidal flux of about 12 years, also consistent with a\nsimple estimate based on turbulent diffusivity. Consequently, toroidal flux\nloss by flux emergence is a relevant contribution to the budget of net toroidal\nflux in the solar convection zone.

Through different models, it has been demonstrated\nthat adopting a variety in the magnitude of the step lengths can greatly\nimprove the search efficiency. However, the precise connection between the\nsearch efficiency and the number of step lengths in the repertoire of the\nsearcher has not been identified. Motivated by biological examples in\none-dimensional terrains, a recent paper studied the best cover time on an\nn-node cycle that can be achieved by a random walk process that uses k step\nlengths. By tuning the lengths and corresponding probabilities the authors\ntherein showed that the best cover time is roughly n 1+$\\Theta$(1/k). While\nthis bound is useful for large values of k, it is hardly informative for small\nk values, which are of interest in biology. In this paper, we provide a tight\nbound for the cover time of such a walk, for every integer k > 1. Specifically,\nup to lower order polylogarithmic factors, the upper bound on the cover time is\na polynomial in n of exponent 1+ 1/(2k--1).

However, in the single-pass\nstreaming model, where the elements arrive one by one and an algorithm can\nstore only a small fraction of input elements, there is much gap in our\nknowledge, even though several approximation algorithms have been proposed in\nthe literature.\n  In this work, we present the first lower bound on the approximation ratios\nfor cardinality and matroid constraints that beat $1-\\frac{1}{e}$ in the\nsingle-pass streaming model. Let $n$ be the number of elements in the stream.\nThen, we prove that any (randomized) streaming algorithm for a cardinality\nconstraint with approximation ratio $\\frac{2}{2+\\sqrt{2}}+\\varepsilon$ requires\n$\\Omega\\left(\\frac{n}{K^2}\\right)$ space for any $\\varepsilon>0$, where $K$ is\nthe size limit of the output set.

Specifically,\nwe show weak-oracle streaming algorithms for cardinality and matroid\nconstraints with approximation ratios $\\frac{K}{2K-1}$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$,\nrespectively, whose space complexity is exponential in $K$ but is independent\nof $n$. The former one exactly matches the known inapproximability result for a\ncardinality constraint in the weak oracle model.\n  The latter one almost matches our lower bound of $\\frac{K}{2K-1}$ for a\nmatroid constraint, which almost settles the approximation ratio for a matroid\nconstraint that can be obtained by a streaming algorithm whose space complexity\nis independent of $n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 12:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-14"}

Low-mass protostars drive powerful molecular outflows that can be\nobserved with mm and sub-mm telescopes. Various sulfuretted species are known\nto be bright in shocks and could be used to infer the physical and chemical\nconditions throughout the observed outflows. Aims. The evolution of sulfur\nchemistry is studied along the outflows driven by the NGC1333-IRAS4A\nprotobinary system located in the Perseus cloud to constrain the physical and\nchemical processes at work in shocks. Methods. We observed various transitions\nfrom OCS, CS, SO, and SO$_2$ towards NGC1333-IRAS4A in the 1.3, 2, and 3mm\nbands using the IRAM NOEMA array and we interpreted the observations through\nthe use of the Paris-Durham shock model. Results. The targeted species clearly\nshow different spatial emission along the two outflows driven by IRAS4A. OCS is\nbrighter on small and large scales along the south outflow driven by IRAS4A1,\nwhereas SO$_2$ is detected rather along the outflow driven by IRAS4A2 that is\nextended along the north east - south west (NE-SW) direction. Column density\nratio maps estimated from a rotational diagram analysis allowed us to confirm a\nclear gradient of the OCS/SO$_2$ column density ratio between the IRAS4A1 and\nIRAS4A2 outflows. SO is detected at extremely high radial velocity up to 25\nkm/s relative to the source velocity, clearly allowing us to distinguish the\ntwo outflows on small scales. Conclusions. The observed chemical\ndifferentiation between the two outflows of the IRAS4A system could be\nexplained by a different chemical history. The outflow driven by IRAS4A1 is\nlikely younger and more enriched in species initially formed in interstellar\nices, such as OCS, and recently sputtered into the shock gas. In contrast, the\nlonger and likely older outflow triggered by IRAS4A2 is more enriched in\nspecies that have a gas phase origin, such as SO$_2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 12:38:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 10:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

It is a\nfundamental issue for many computer vision and image analysis techniques and it\nis still a challenging task to artificial visual systems. Chaotic phase\nsynchronization takes place in cases involving almost identical dynamical\nsystems and it means that the phase difference between the systems is kept\nbounded over the time, while their amplitudes remain chaotic and may be\nuncorrelated. Instead of complete synchronization, phase synchronization is\nbelieved to be a mechanism for neural integration in brain. In this paper, an\nobject selection model is proposed. Oscillators in the network representing the\nsalient object in a given scene are phase synchronized, while no phase\nsynchronization occurs for background objects. In this way, the salient object\ncan be extracted. In this model, a shift mechanism is also introduced to change\nattention from one object to another. Computer simulations show that the model\nproduces some results similar to those observed in natural vision systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 13:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-14"}

Considering this\nmodel, we propose a novel discrete rate based minimum length scheduling problem\nto determine the optimal power control, rate adaptation and transmission\nschedule subject to data, energy causality and maximum transmit power\nconstraints. The proposed optimization problem is proven to be NP-hard which\nrequires exponential-time algorithms to solve for the global optimum. As a\nsolution strategy, first, we demonstrate that the power control and rate\nadaptation, and scheduling problems can be solved separately in the optimal\nsolution. For the power control and rate adaptation problem, we derive the\noptimal solution based on the proposed minimum length scheduling slot\ndefinition. For the scheduling, we classify the problem based on the\ndistribution of minimum length scheduling slots of the users over time. For the\nnon-overlapping slots scenario, we present the optimal scheduling algorithm.\nFor the overlapping scenario, we propose a polynomial-time heuristic scheduling\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 14:31:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Classical results show that a natural random walk, Langevin\ndiffusion, mixes rapidly when f is convex. Unfortunately, even in simple\nexamples, the applications listed above will entail working with functions f\nthat are nonconvex -- for which sampling from p may in general require an\nexponential number of queries.\n  In this paper, we focus on an aspect of nonconvexity relevant for modern\nmachine learning applications: existence of invariances (symmetries) in the\nfunction f, as a result of which the distribution p will have manifolds of\npoints with equal probability.

Answering questions about why things\nare happening or how to take optimal actions to improve metrics are relegated\nto niche fields of research and generally neglected in industry data science\nanalysis. We survey technical methods to answer these other important\nquestions, describe areas in which some of these methods are being applied, and\nprovide a practical example of how to apply our methodology and selected\nmethods to a real business use case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 21:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

However, the\nimages can be captured in such scenarios using Near-Infrared (NIR) and Thermal\n(THM) cameras. The NIR and THM images contain the limited details. Thus, there\nis a need to transform the images from THM/NIR to VIS for better understanding.\nHowever, it is non-trivial task due to the large domain discrepancies and lack\nof abundant datasets. Nowadays, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is able to\ntransform the images from one domain to another domain. Most of the available\nGAN based methods use the combination of the adversarial and the pixel-wise\nlosses (like $L_1$ or $L_2$) as the objective function for training. The\nquality of transformed images in case of THM/NIR to VIS transformation is still\nnot up to the mark using such objective function. Thus, better objective\nfunctions are needed to improve the quality, fine details and realism of the\ntransformed images. A new model for THM/NIR to VIS image transformation called\nPerceptual Cyclic-Synthesized Generative Adversarial Network (PCSGAN) is\nintroduced to address these issues. The PCSGAN uses the combination of the\nperceptual (i.e., feature based) losses along with the pixel-wise and the\nadversarial losses. Both the quantitative and qualitative measures are used to\njudge the performance of the PCSGAN model over the WHU-IIP face and the RGB-NIR\nscene datasets. The proposed PCSGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art image\ntransformation models, including Pix2pix, DualGAN, CycleGAN, PS2GAN, and PAN in\nterms of the SSIM, MSE, PSNR and LPIPS evaluation measures.

The mean binary mass ratio $1.45\\pm0.07$ we show is\nconsistent with pairs drawn randomly from the mass distribution of black holes\nin our Galaxy. However, BBH masses are concentrated around $\\simeq 30M_\\odot$,\nwhereas black holes in our Galaxy peak at $\\simeq 10M_\\odot$. This mass\ndifference can be reconciled by gravitational lensing magnification which\nallows distant events to be detected with typically $z\\simeq 2$, so the\nwaveform is reduced in frequency by $1+z$, and hence the measured chirp masses\nappear 3 times larger than their intrinsic values. This redshift enhancement\nalso accounts for the dispersion of primary and secondary masses, both of which\nshould increase as $1+z$, thereby appearing to scale with mass, in agreement\nwith the data. Thus the BBH component masses provide independent support for\nlensing, implying most high chirp mass events have intrinsic masses like the\nstellar mass black holes in our Galaxy, coalescing at $z>1$, with only two low\nmass BBH detections, of $\\simeq 10M_\\odot$ as expected for unlensed events in\nthe local Universe, $z\\simeq 0.1$.

Our results show that FU\nOrionis-type stars can be similar to both Class I and Class II systems and may\nbe in a special evolutionary phase between the two classes with their\ninfall-driven episodic eruptions being the main driving force of the\ntransition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 09:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}
