To perform\ncorrect deduction of message semantics or behavior analysis, accurate message\ntype identification is an essential first step. However, identifying message\ntypes is particularly difficult for binary protocols, whose structural features\nare hidden in their densely packed data representation. We leverage the\nintrinsic structural features of binary protocols and propose an accurate\nmethod for discriminating message types.\n  Our approach uses a similarity measure with continuous value range by\ncomparing feature vectors where vector elements correspond to the fields in a\nmessage, rather than discrete byte values. This enables a better recognition of\nstructural patterns, which remain hidden when only exact value matches are\nconsidered. We combine Hirschberg alignment with DBSCAN as cluster algorithm to\nyield a novel inference mechanism. By applying novel autoconfiguration schemes,\nwe do not require manually configured parameters for the analysis of an unknown\nprotocol, as required by earlier approaches.\n  Results of our evaluations show that our approach has considerable advantages\nin message type identification result quality and also execution performance\nover previous approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Feb 2020 16:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 23:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Further, we show that graph embedding for\npredicting enzymatic links improves link prediction by 24% over\nfingerprint-similarity-based approaches. To emphasize the importance of graph\nembedding in the context of biochemical networks, we illustrate how graph\nembedding can also guide visualization.\n  The code and datasets are available through\nhttps://github.com/HassounLab/ELP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Feb 2020 18:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

The underlying mechanism is Bragg resonance -- reflected\nwaves generated via nonlinear resonant interactions between an incident wave\nand a rippled bottom. We theoretically explain the fundamental effect of two\ncounter-propagating Stokes waves on Stokes drift and then perform numerical\nsimulations of Bragg resonance using High-order Spectral method. A\nmonochromatic incident wave on interaction with a patch of bottom ripple yields\na complex interference between the incident and reflected waves. When the\nvelocity induced by the reflected waves exceeds that of the incident, particle\ntrajectories reverse, leading to a backward drift. Lagrangian and\nLagrangian-mean trajectories reveal that surface particles near the up-wave\nside of the patch are either trapped or reflected, implying that the rippled\npatch acts as a non-surface-invasive particle trap or reflector. On increasing\nthe length and amplitude of the rippled patch; reflection, and thus the\neffectiveness of the patch, increases. The inclusion of realistic constant\ncurrent shows noticeable differences between Lagrangian-mean trajectories with\nand without the rippled patch. Theoretical analysis reveals additional terms in\nthe Stokes drift arising from the particular solution due to\nmean-current--bottom-ripple interactions, irrespective of whether Bragg\nresonance condition is met.

Consequently, the\nrotation periods have been successfully determined only for a small fraction of\nthe Sun-like stars observed by transit-based planet-hunting missions, such as\nCoRoT, Kepler, and TESS. This suggests that only a small fraction of such\nsystems have been properly identified as solar-like analogs. We apply a new\nmethod for determining rotation periods of low-activity stars, like the Sun.\nThe method is based on calculating the gradient of the power spectrum (GPS) of\nstellar brightness variations and identifying a tell-tale inflection point in\nthe spectrum. The rotation frequency is then proportional to the frequency of\nthat inflection point. In this paper test this GPS method against available\nphotometric records of the Sun.

In this paper, we first analytically study the throughput\nperformance of NOMA-based random access (RA), namely NOMA-RA. We show that\nwhile increasing the number of power levels in NOMA-RA leads to a further gain\nin maximum throughput, the growth of throughput gain is slower than linear.\nThis is due to the higher-power dominance characteristic in power-domain NOMA\nknown in the literature. We explicitly quantify the throughput gain for the\nvery first time in this paper. With our analytical model, we verify the\nperformance advantage of the proposed NOMA-RA scheme by comparing with the\nbaseline multi-channel slotted ALOHA (MS-ALOHA), with and without capture\neffect. Despite the higher-power dominance effect, the maximum throughput of\nNOMA-RA with four power levels achieves over three times that of the MS-ALOHA.\nHowever, our analytical results also reveal the sensitivity of load on the\nthroughput of NOMA-RA. To cope with the potential bursty traffic in mMTC\nscenarios, we propose adaptive load regulation through a practical user barring\nalgorithm. By estimating the current load based on the observable channel\nfeedback, the algorithm adaptively controls user access to maintain the optimal\nloading of channels to achieve maximum throughput. When the proposed user\nbarring algorithm is applied, simulations demonstrate that the instantaneous\nthroughput of NOMA-RA always remains close to the maximum throughput confirming\nthe effectiveness of our load regulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Feb 2020 21:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

In an attempt to bring computer vision\nalgorithms closer to the capabilities of a human operator, the mechanisms of\nthe human visual system was analyzed in this work. Recent studies show that the\nmechanisms behind the recognition process in the human brain include continuous\ngeneration of predictions based on prior knowledge of the world. These\npredictions enable rapid generation of contextual hypotheses that bias the\noutcome of the recognition process. This mechanism is especially advantageous\nin situations of uncertainty, when visual input is ambiguous.

As a result, although they process massive amounts of\nvisual information during their operation, the information is not transformed\ninto knowledge that can be used to generate contextual predictions and improve\ntheir performance.

Additionally, how exactly cold pools\ninteract is insufficiently known. To better understand this dynamics, we\ndevelop a tracking algorithm for cold pool gust fronts. Rather than tracking\nthermodynamic anomalies, which do not generally coincide with the gust front\nboundaries, our approach tracks the dynamical cold pool outflow. Our algorithm\nfirst determines the locus of the precipitation event. Second, relative to this\norigin and for each azimuthal bin, the steepest gradient in the near-surface\nhorizontal radial velocity $v_r$ is employed to determine the respective locus\nof the cold pool gust front edge. Steepest $v_r$-gradients imply largest\nupdraft velocities, hence strongest dynamical triggering. Results are compared\nto a previous algorithm based on the steepest gradient in temperature ---\nhighlighting the benefit of the method described here in determining\ndynamically active gust front regions. Applying the method to a range of\nnumerical experiments, the algorithm successfully tracks an ensemble of cold\npools.

In such scenarios it is common practice to use\nthe human innate ability to implicitly learn such a relationship and manually\ntune the corresponding controller to achieve the desirable closed loop\nperformance. This approach has its deficiencies because of individual\nvariations due to experience levels and preferences in the absence of an\nexplicit calibration metric. Moreover, as the complexity of the underlying\nsystem and/or the controller increase, in the effort to achieve better\nperformance, so does the tuning time and the associated tuning cost. To reduce\nthe overall tuning cost, a tuning framework is proposed herein, whereby a\nsupervised machine learning is used to extract the human-learned cost function\nand an optimization algorithm that can efficiently deal with a large number of\nvariables, is used for optimizing the extracted cost function.

To generate visually more\nnatural and plausible examples, we further propose the saliency-regularized\nadversarial kernel prediction, where the salient region serves as a moving\nobject, and the predicted kernel is regularized to achieve naturally visual\neffects. Besides, the attack is further enhanced by adaptively tuning the\ntranslations of object and background.

Indeed,\nsubmodularity is inherently related to the notions of diversity, coverage, and\nrepresentativeness. In particular, finding the mode of many popular\nprobabilistic models of diversity, such as determinantal point processes,\nsubmodular probabilistic models, and strongly log-concave distributions,\ninvolves maximization of (regularized) submodular functions. Since a\nregularized function $f$ can potentially take on negative values, the classic\ntheory of submodular maximization, which heavily relies on the non-negativity\nassumption of submodular functions, may not be applicable. To circumvent this\nchallenge, we develop the first one-pass streaming algorithm for maximizing a\nregularized submodular function subject to a $k$-cardinality constraint. It\nreturns a solution $S$ with the guarantee that $f(S)\\geq(\\phi^{-2}-\\epsilon)\n\\cdot g(OPT)-\\ell (OPT)$, where $\\phi$ is the golden ratio. Furthermore, we\ndevelop the first distributed algorithm that returns a solution $S$ with the\nguarantee that $\\mathbb{E}[f(S)] \\geq (1-\\epsilon) [(1-e^{-1}) \\cdot\ng(OPT)-\\ell(OPT)]$ in $O(1/ \\epsilon)$ rounds of MapReduce computation, without\nkeeping multiple copies of the entire dataset in each round (as it is usually\ndone). We should highlight that our result, even for the unregularized case\nwhere the modular term $\\ell$ is zero, improves the memory and communication\ncomplexity of the existing work by a factor of $O(1/ \\epsilon)$ while arguably\nprovides a simpler distributed algorithm and a unifying analysis. We also\nempirically study the performance of our scalable methods on a set of real-life\napplications, including finding the mode of distributions, data summarization,\nand product recommendation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 02:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

The models and\nmethods are illustrated and compared via a novel analysis of a Hemlock lumber\ndataset. Practical usage of the fitted damage models is demonstrated with an\napplication to long-term reliability prediction under stochastic future\nloadings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 04:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

A novel weight learning algorithm is introduced such that neither\nnetwork connectivity nor a sequence of history records is required to achieve\nresilient consensus. The critical idea is to dynamically update the interaction\nweights among neighbors learnt from their credibility measurement. Basically,\nwe define a reward function that is inversely proportional to the distance to\nits neighbor, and then adjust the credibility based on the reward derived at\nthe present step and the previous credibility. In such a way, the interaction\nweights are updated at every step, which integrates the historic information\nand degrades the influences from faulty nodes. Both fixed and stochastic\ntopologies are considered in this paper. Furthermore, we apply this novel\napproach in clock synchronization problem. By updating the logical clock skew\nand offset via the corresponding weight learning algorithms, respectively, the\nlogical clock synchronization is eventually achieved regardless of faulty\nnodes.

Although (Kim et al, 2017) proposed to\ninterpret intermediate layers by quantifying its ability to distinguish a\nuser-defined concept (from random examples), the questions of robustness\n(variation against the choice of random examples) and effectiveness (retrieval\nrate of concept images) remain. We investigate these two properties and propose\nimprovements to make concept activations reliable for practical use.\n  Effectiveness: If the intermediate layer has effectively learned a\nuser-defined concept, it should be able to recall --- at the testing step ---\nmost of the images containing the proposed concept. For instance, we observed\nthat the recall rate of Tiger shark and Great white shark from the ImageNet\ndataset with \"Fins\" as a user-defined concept was only 18.35% for VGG16. To\nincrease the effectiveness of concept learning, we propose A-CAV --- the\nAdversarial Concept Activation Vector --- this results in larger margins\nbetween user concepts and (negative) random examples. This approach improves\nthe aforesaid recall to 76.83% for VGG16.\n  For robustness, we define it as the ability of an intermediate layer to be\nconsistent in its recall rate (the effectiveness) for different random seeds.\nWe observed that TCAV has a large variance in recalling a concept across\ndifferent random seeds. For example, the recall of cat images (from a layer\nlearning the concept of tail) varies from 18% to 86% with 20.85% standard\ndeviation on VGG16.

More specifically, the current\nvalue of the state indicator is determined only by the value of the state\nindicator from the previous period, thus the Markov property, and the\ntransition matrix. The latter characterizes the properties of the Markov\nprocess by determining with what probability each of the states can be visited\nnext period, given the state in the current period. This setup decides on the\ntwo main advantages of the Markov switching models.

The coupling constants are not all independent.\nThe relationships between the coupling constants enable us to obtain a gauge\ninvariant effective action, from which we can see that the masses of the vector\nKK modes depend on all the three extra dimensions. The masses of the scalar\nmodes, however, depend only on two of the three extra dimensions. Then we\ngeneralize the results into branes with codimension $d$ ($d=1, 2...$), and find\nthat $d$ will directly affect the masses of the KK modes. But there is always a\ngauge invariant effective action for the massive vector KK modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 09:07:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 00:07:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 12:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

In this work, we focus on higher order\nstatistics of the weak lensing convergence field, namely its cumulants such as\nskewness and kurtosis and its one-point probability distribution (PDF), and we\nquantify using perturbation theory the corrections coming from post-Born\neffects, meaning beyond the straight-line and independent lenses\napproximations. At first order, two such corrections arise: lens-lens couplings\nand geodesic deviation. Though the corrections are small for low source\nredshifts (below a few percents) and therefore for galaxy lensing, they become\nimportant at higher redshifts, notably in the context of CMB lensing, where the\nnon-gaussianities computed from tree-order perturbation theory are found to be\nof the same order as the signal itself. We include these post-Born corrections\non the skewness into a prediction for the one-point convergence PDF obtained\nwith large deviation theory and successfully test these results against\nnumerical simulations.

Local strain engineering in 2D TMDs is achieved via strained\nwrinkles. Wrinkles on thick layers of TMDs are reported to show interesting\nphotoluminescence enhancement due to bandgap modulation and funneling effect.\nHowever, the wrinkles in ultrathin TMDs have not been investigated because they\ncan easily fall down to form folds in these ultrathin layers of TMDCs.

Additionally\nmodelling the latter, however, is particularly beneficial if the domain of the\ntraining data varies from that of the data to be processed. For this purpose,\nin the present work the idea of probabilistic deep learning is applied to the\ntask of dense stereo matching for the first time. Based on the well-known and\ncommonly employed GC-Net architecture, a novel probabilistic neural network is\npresented, for the task of joint depth and uncertainty estimation from epipolar\nrectified stereo image pairs. Instead of learning the network parameters\ndirectly, the proposed probabilistic neural network learns a probability\ndistribution from which parameters are sampled for every prediction. The\nvariations between multiple such predictions on the same image pair allow to\napproximate the model uncertainty.

Marginal structural models (MSMs), estimated using inverse\nprobability of treatment weighting or the g-formula, are popular for handling\nthis problem. With increasing development of advanced causal inference methods,\nit is important to be able to assess their performance in different scenarios\nto guide their application. Simulation studies are a key tool for this, but\ntheir use to evaluate causal inference methods has been limited. This paper\nfocuses on the use of simulations for evaluations involving MSMs in studies\nwith a time-to-event outcome. In a simulation, it is important to be able to\ngenerate the data in such a way that the correct form of any models to be\nfitted to those data is known. However, this is not straightforward in the\nlongitudinal setting because it is natural for data to be generated in a\nsequential conditional manner, whereas MSMs involve fitting marginal rather\nthan conditional hazard models. We provide general results that enable the form\nof the correctly-specified MSM to be derived based on a conditional data\ngenerating procedure, and show how the results can be applied when the\nconditional hazard model is an Aalen additive hazard or Cox model.

The\nproteins needed to form and maintain flagella are synthesized in the cell body\nand transported to the distal tips. What `rulers' or `timers' a specific type\nof cells use to strike a balance between the outward and inward transport of\nmaterials so as to maintain a particular length of its flagella in the steady\nstate is one of the open questions in cellular self-organization. Even more\ncurious is how the two flagella of biflagellates, like Chlamydomonas\nReinhardtii, communicate through their base to coordinate their lengths. In\nthis paper we develop a stochastic model for flagellar length control based on\na time-of-flight (ToF) mechanism. This ToF mechanism decides whether or not\nstructural proteins are to be loaded onto an intraflagellar transport (IFT)\ntrain just before it begins its motorized journey from the base to the tip of\nthe flagellum. Because of the ongoing turnover, the structural proteins\nreleased from the flagellar tip are transported back to the cell body also by\nIFT trains. We represent the traffic of IFT trains as a totally asymmetric\nsimple exclusion process (TASEP). The ToF mechanism for each flagellum,\ntogether with the TASEP-based description of the IFT trains, combined with a\nscenario of sharing of a common pool of flagellar structural proteins in\nbiflagellates, can account for all key features of experimentally known\nphenomena. These include ciliogenesis, resorption, deflagellation as well as\nregeneration after selective amputation of one of the two flagella. We also\nshow that the experimental observations of Ishikawa and Marshall are consistent\nwith the ToF mechanism of length control if the effects of the mutual exclusion\nof the IFT trains captured by the TASEP are taken into account. Moreover, we\nmake new predictions on the flagellar length fluctuations and the role of the\ncommon pool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 12:20:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 15:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

In addition, most\nmethods predict all facial attributes using the same CNN network architecture,\nwhich ignores the different learning complexities of facial attributes. To\naddress the above problems, we propose a novel deep multi-task multi-label CNN,\ntermed DMM-CNN, for effective FAC. Specifically, DMM-CNN jointly optimizes two\nclosely-related tasks (i.e., facial landmark detection and FAC) to improve the\nperformance of FAC by taking advantage of multi-task learning. To deal with the\ndiverse learning complexities of facial attributes, we divide the attributes\ninto two groups: objective attributes and subjective attributes. Two different\nnetwork architectures are respectively designed to extract features for two\ngroups of attributes, and a novel dynamic weighting scheme is proposed to\nautomatically assign the loss weight to each facial attribute during training.\nFurthermore, an adaptive thresholding strategy is developed to effectively\nalleviate the problem of class imbalance for multi-label learning.

Because of the dramatic\nimpact of this structure on the simulated dynamics, modelers create this\nnetwork for it to match criteria of plausibility (e.g. the small-world\nproperty). Networks are actually created by one network generator compliant\nwith these criteria, like the Watts-Strogatz algorithm in the case of\nsmall-world networks. However, this practice comes to study the model's\ndynamics over the specific networks generated by one algorithm instead of the\ndynamics over the class of networks of interest, possibly inducing a strong\nbias in results. We identify three problematics related to this bias: (i)\nrepresentativity of a network generator to a class of networks, (ii)\nconclusiveness of simulations over a class of networks and (iii) the gain in\nconclusiveness when refining the criteria for network choice. We propose an\nexperimental protocol and instantiate it on small-world networks for epidemics,\nopinion and culture dynamics. We show that (i) Watts-Strogatz networks are not\nrepresentative of small-world networks (ii) simulation results over\nsmall-worlds are arguably inconclusive, and (iii) even small-world networks\nhaving the same size, density, transitivity and average path length do not lead\nto coherent results.

In practice however, local\ndefects added to a normal image can deteriorate the whole reconstruction,\nmaking this segmentation challenging.

In addition, we propose two new sequences that do not provide\nany pseudoprimes up to $10^9$ at all.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 14:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

For these robots, object recognition is a\nchallenging task due to the high demand for accurate and real-time response\nunder changing and unpredictable environmental conditions. Most of the recent\napproaches use either the shape information only and ignore the role of color\ninformation or vice versa. Furthermore, they mainly utilize the $L_n$ Minkowski\nfamily functions to measure the similarity of two object views, while there are\nvarious distance measures that are applicable to compare two object views. In\nthis paper, we explore the importance of shape information, color constancy,\ncolor spaces, and various similarity measures in open-ended 3D object\nrecognition. Towards this goal, we extensively evaluate the performance of\nobject recognition approaches in three different configurations, including\n\\textit{color-only}, \\textit{shape-only}, and \\textit{ combinations of color\nand shape}, in both offline and online settings. Experimental results\nconcerning scalability, memory usage, and object recognition performance show\nthat all of the \\textit{combinations of color and shape} yields significant\nimprovements over the \\textit{shape-only} and \\textit{color-only} approaches.\nThe underlying reason is that color information is an important feature to\ndistinguish objects that have very similar geometric properties with different\ncolors and vice versa. Moreover, by combining color and shape information, we\ndemonstrate that the robot can learn new object categories from very few\ntraining examples in a real-world setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 14:24:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2020 12:18:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

To meet these\nchallenges, the emergence of Elastic Optical Networks (EON) has brought new\nconceptions in the operation of optical networks, improving flexibility and\nefficiency for the next generation core networks. In EON, traffic demands are\ntypically supported by allocating bandwidth-variable optical channels with\nheterogeneous modulation formats in a spectral-efficient manner. Elastic\noptical path networks require the routing, modulation level, and spectrum\nallocation (RMLSA) to efficiently allocate optical spectrum resources to\noptical paths. To address the RMLSA problem, Modulation Scheme approaches have\nrecently been proposed to allow the use of any routing and spectrum assignment\n(RSA) algorithm to solve the RMLSA problem.

We also\ninvestigate the case when a malicious agent is interested in affecting the\nbehavior of the bandit algorithm in a single context (e.g., a specific user).\nWe first provide sufficient conditions for the feasibility of the attack and we\nthen propose an efficient algorithm to perform the attack.

ECG signal is a weak,\nnon-stationary, and nonlinear signal, which indicates the health of a heart in\nterms of temporal variations of electromagnetic pulses from the heart. Abnormal\nfluctuations in ECG signal invokes the possibility of various cardiovascular\ndisorders, which is diagnosed through intuitive analysis of the ECG reports by\nthe medical practitioners. This could be made fast, accurate, and simple by\nimposing advanced nonlinear tools on the recorded ECG signals. In this paper, a\nwell-known nonlinear technique, i.e., Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method\nis adopted to extract the hidden information in the recorded ECG signal. Here,\nwe try to explore the human heart as a dynamic model and perform EMD on ECG\nreports distinguishing arrhythmia from normal data obtained from the widely\nused MIT-BIH database. EMD essentially involves the decomposition of the signal\ninto a finite number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), keeping its original\nproperties unaltered. For analysis, we use the powerful Savitzky-Golay (SG)\nfilter for removing non-stationary noises from the ECG signals. The popular\nnonlinear parameter Hurst Exponent (H) is estimated for every IMF by R/S\ntechnique. We identified a distinct margin of the H of 1st IMFs in between the\nnormal and the arrhythmia affected patients. Our model confirms with 94.92%\ncertainty the chances of occurrence of arrhythmia disease in patients by\ndiagnosing ECG signals without performing other expensive and time-consuming\ntechniques such as Holter test, echocardiogram, and stress test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 15:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

We\ndemonstrate their fabrication from superconducting Nb films and the fabrication\nof superconducting particles from Nb or Pb. We apply finite element modeling\n(FEM) to analyze these two trap architectures in detail with respect to trap\nstability and frequency. Crucially, in FEM we account for the complete\nthree-dimensional geometry of the traps, finite magnetic field penetration into\nthe levitated superconducting particle, demagnetizing effects, and flux\nquantization. We can, thus, analyze trap properties beyond assumptions made in\nanalytical models. We find that realistic AHC traps yield trap frequencies well\nabove 10kHz for levitation of micrometer-sized particles and can be fabricated\nwith a three-layer process, while DL traps enable trap frequencies below 1kHz\nand are simpler to fabricate in a single-layer process. Our numerical results\nguide future experiments aiming at levitating micrometer-sized particles in the\nMeissner state with chip-based superconducting traps. The modeling we use is\nalso applicable in other scenarios using superconductors in the Meissner state,\nsuch as for designing superconducting magnetic shields or for calculating\nfilling factors in superconducting resonators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 15:31:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 22:11:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 19:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

We show that by using a novel\nReinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach called SparseIDS, we can reduce the\nnumber of consumed packets by more than three fourths while keeping\nclassification accuracy high. To minimize the computational expenses of the\nRL-based sampling we show that a shared neural network can be used for both the\nclassifier and the RL logic.

Comparing to various other sampling techniques,\nSparseIDS consistently achieves higher classification accuracy by learning to\nsample only relevant packets. A major novelty of our RL-based approach is that\nit can not only skip up to a predefined maximum number of samples like other\napproaches proposed in the domain of Natural Language Processing but can even\nskip arbitrarily many packets in one step. This enables saving even more\ncomputational resources for long sequences. Inspecting SparseIDS's behavior of\nchoosing packets shows that it adopts different sampling strategies for\ndifferent attack types and network flows. Finally we build an automatic\nsteering mechanism that can guide SparseIDS in deployment to achieve a desired\nlevel of sparsity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 15:38:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 12:18:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 15:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-16"}

Here, we formulate the Discrete Chi-square Method\n(DCM) that can determine the best model for many signals superimposed on\narbitrary polynomial trends. DCM minimizes the Chi-square for the data in the\nmulti-dimensional tested frequency space. The required number of tested\nfrequency combinations remains manageable, because the method test statistic is\nsymmetric in this tested frequency space. With our known tested constant\nfrequency grid values, the non-linear DCM model becomes linear, and all results\nbecome unambiguous. We test DCM with simulated data containing different\nmixtures of signals and trends. DCM gives unambiguous results, if the signal\nfrequencies are not too close to each other, and none of the signals is too\nweak. It relies on brute computational force, because all possible free\nparameter combinations for all reasonable linear models are tested. DCM works\nlike winning a lottery by buying all lottery tickets.

Since a large number of hyperparameters of a deep neural\nnetwork, such as a convolutional neural network, occupy much memory, a\nmemory-inefficient deep learning model is not ideal for real-time Internet of\nThings (IoT) applications on various devices, such as mobile phones. Thus, it\nis necessary to develop fast and memory-efficient Artificial Intelligence of\nThings (AIoT) systems for real-time on-device applications. We created a novel\nwide and shallow 4-layer ANN called \"Pairwise Neural Network\" (\"PairNet\") with\nhigh-speed non-gradient-descent hyperparameter optimization. The PairNet is\ntrained quickly with only one epoch since its hyperparameters are directly\noptimized one-time via simply solving a system of linear equations by using the\nmultivariate least squares fitting method. In addition, an n-input space is\npartitioned into many n-input data subspaces, and a local PairNet is built in a\nlocal n-input subspace. This divide-and-conquer approach can train the local\nPairNet using specific local features to improve model performance. Simulation\nresults indicate that the three PairNets with incremental learning have smaller\naverage prediction mean squared errors, and achieve much higher speeds than\ntraditional ANNs. An important future work is to develop better and faster\nnon-gradient-descent hyperparameter optimization algorithms to generate\neffective, fast, and memory-efficient PairNets with incremental learning on\noptimal subspaces for real-time AIoT on-device applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 02:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

This requires a paradigm shift towards the development of innovative\ntechnologies for next generation wireless systems. One of the key challenges is\nthe scarcity of spectrum, owing to the unprecedented broadband penetration rate\nin recent years. A promising solution is the proposal of visible light\ncommunications (VLC), which explores the unregulated visible light spectrum to\nenable high-speed communications, in addition to efficient lighting. This\nsolution offers a wider bandwidth that can accommodate ubiquitous broadband\nconnectivity to indoor users and offload data traffic from cellular networks.\nAlthough VLC is secure and able to overcome the shortcomings of RF systems, it\nsuffers from several limitations, e.g., limited modulation bandwidth. In this\nrespect, solutions have been proposed recently to overcome this limitation. In\nparticular, most common orthogonal and non-orthogonal multiple access\ntechniques initially proposed for RF systems, e.g., space-division multiple\naccess (SDMA) and NOMA, have been considered in the context of VLC.

Contrary to the existing methods that\nlearn only the representation of a 3D object, our approach simultaneously finds\na representation of the object and its 3D surface. The main idea of our\nHyperCloud method is to build a hyper network that returns weights of a\nparticular neural network (target network) trained to map points from a uniform\nunit ball distribution into a 3D shape. As a consequence, a particular 3D shape\ncan be generated using point-by-point sampling from the assumed prior\ndistribution and transforming sampled points with the target network. Since the\nhyper network is based on an auto-encoder architecture trained to reconstruct\nrealistic 3D shapes, the target network weights can be considered a\nparametrization of the surface of a 3D shape, and not a standard representation\nof point cloud usually returned by competitive approaches. The proposed\narchitecture allows finding mesh-based representation of 3D objects in a\ngenerative manner while providing point clouds en pair in quality with the\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 11:09:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 19:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

Current approaches utilise vocal, facial, and bodily modalities. Of\nthese, the bodily modality is the least investigated, partially due to the\ndifficulty in extracting bodily representations from videos, and partially due\nto the lack of viable datasets. Existing body modality approaches use automatic\ncategorization of expressions to represent body language as a series of\nspecific expressions, much like words within natural language. In this\ndissertation I present a new type of feature, within the body modality, that\nrepresents meta information of gestures, such as speed, and use it to predict a\nnon-clinical depression label. This differs to existing work by representing\noverall behaviour as a small set of aggregated meta features derived from a\nperson's movement. In my method I extract pose estimation from videos, detect\ngestures within body parts, extract meta information from individual gestures,\nand finally aggregate these features to generate a small feature vector for use\nin prediction tasks. I introduce a new dataset of 65 video recordings of\ninterviews with self-evaluated distress, personality, and demographic labels.\nThis dataset enables the development of features utilising the whole body in\ndistress detection tasks. I evaluate my newly introduced meta-features for\npredicting depression, anxiety, perceived stress, somatic stress, five standard\npersonality measures, and gender. A linear regression based classifier using\nthese features achieves a 82.70% F1 score for predicting depression within my\nnovel dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 14:38:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

Recently,\nlight-harvesting complexes (LHC) have been proposed as potential dyes in DSSCs\nbased on their higher light-absorption efficiencies as compared to synthetic\ndyes. In this work, photo-electrochemical hybrid devices were rationally\ndesigned by adding for the first time Leu and Lys tags to heterologously\nexpressed light-harvesting proteins from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, thus\nallowing their proper orientation and immobilization on graphene electrodes.\nThe light-harvesting complex 4 from C. reinhardtii (LHC4) was initially\nexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified via affinity chromatography and\nsubsequently immobilized on plasma-treated thin-film graphene electrodes. A\nphotocurrent density of 40.30 \\pm 9.26 \\mu A/cm2 was measured on devices using\nliquid electrolytes supplemented with a phosphonated viologen to facilitate\ncharge transfer.
