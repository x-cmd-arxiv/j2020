Functional network models often employ rate units that are\ncontinuously coupled by analog signals. Is there a qualitative difference\nimplied by these two forms of signaling? We develop a unified mean-field theory\nfor large random networks to show that first- and second-order statistics in\nrate and binary networks are in fact identical if rate neurons receive the\nright amount of noise. Their response to presented stimuli, however, can be\nradically different. We quantify these differences by studying how nearby state\ntrajectories evolve over time, asking to what extent the dynamics is chaotic.\nChaos in the two models is found to be qualitatively different. In binary\nnetworks we find a network-size-dependent transition to chaos and a chaotic\nsubmanifold whose dimensionality expands stereotypically with time, while rate\nnetworks with matched statistics are nonchaotic. Dimensionality expansion in\nchaotic binary networks aids classification in reservoir computing and optimal\nperformance is reached within about a single activation per neuron; a fast\nmechanism for computation that we demonstrate also in spiking networks. A\ngeneralization of this mechanism extends to rate networks in their respective\nchaotic regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 16:26:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 15:04:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 12:44:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 17:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

By analyzing the most recent Mount Wilson S-index\nCaII data of this star, we found that the chromospheric cycle lasts 2.92 +/-\n0.02 yr, in agreement with past results. From the long-term X-ray lightcurve,\nwe find clear and systematic X-ray variability of our target, consistent with\nthe chromospheric CaII cycle. The average X-ray luminosity results to be 2 x\n10^28 erg/s, with an amplitude that is only a factor 2 throughout the cycle. We\napply a new method to describe the evolution of the coronal emission measure\ndistribution of Epsilon Eridani in terms of solar magnetic structures: active\nregions, cores of active regions and flares covering the stellar surface at\nvarying filling fractions. Combinations of these magnetic structures can\ndescribe the observed X-ray emission measure of Epsilon Eridani only if the\nsolar flare emission measure distribution is restricted to events in the decay\nphase. The interpretation is that flares in the corona of Epsilon Eridani last\nlonger than their solar counterparts. We ascribe this to the lower metallicity\nof Epsilon Eridani. Our analysis revealed also that the X-ray cycle of Epsilon\nEridani is strongly dominated by cores of active regions. The coverage fraction\nof cores throughout the cycle changes by the same factor as the X-ray\nluminosity. The maxima of the cycle are characterized by a high percentage of\ncovering fraction of the flares, consistent with the fact that flaring events\nare seen in the corresponding short-term X-ray lightcurves predominately at the\ncycle maxima. The high X-ray emission throughout the cycle of Epsilon Eridani\nis thus explained by the high percentage of magnetic structures on its surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 16:31:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

This has been tackled by research in Word Sense\nDisambiguation (WSD) in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. Recently,\nWSD and many other NLP tasks have taken advantage of embeddings-based\nrepresentation of words, sentences, and documents. However, when it comes to\nWSD, most embeddings models suffer from ambiguity as they do not capture the\ndifferent possible meanings of the words. Even when they do, the list of\npossible meanings for a word (sense inventory) has to be known in advance at\ntraining time to be included in the embeddings space. Unfortunately, there are\nsituations in which such a sense inventory is not known in advance (e.g., an\nontology selected at run-time), or it evolves with time and its status diverges\nfrom the one at training time. This hampers the use of embeddings models for\nWSD. Furthermore, traditional WSD techniques do not perform well in situations\nin which the available linguistic information is very scarce, such as the case\nof keyword-based queries. In this paper, we propose an approach to keyword\ndisambiguation which grounds on a semantic relatedness between words and senses\nprovided by an external inventory (ontology) that is not known at training\ntime. Building on previous works, we present a semantic relatedness measure\nthat uses word embeddings, and explore different disambiguation algorithms to\nalso exploit both word and sentence representations. Experimental results show\nthat this approach achieves results comparable with the state of the art when\napplied for WSD, without training for a particular domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 16:44:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

It is based on the idea behind an\nartistic technique known as \"string art\" - the representation of an image with\na single thread, tensioned between pins on the flat frame. A discrete\noptimization algorithm has been employed recently to formalize the process of\nfinding a configuration of thread windings that fuses into a given greyscale\nimage. We demonstrate how this algorithm can be employed to approximate the\ntwo-dimensional distribution of isotropic material, computed by a conventional\ntopology optimization algorithm. An optimal composite design is thus found as a\nresult of the following two-stage process. At the first stage, topology\noptimization procedure produces regular grid of greyscale values of stiffness.\nAt the second stage, this distribution is approximated with a polyline,\nrepresenting the stiff reinforcement fiber in a soft matrix, according to\n``string art'' optimization algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed approach\nis illustrated with few simple numerical examples.

Specifically, we\nconduct a library usage analysis (e.g., usage intensity and outdatedness) and a\nlibrary update analysis (e.g., update intensity and delay) using 806\nopen-source projects. The two analyses aim to quantify usage and update\npractices holistically from the perspective of both open-source projects and\nthird-party libraries. Then, we conduct a library risk analysis (e.g.,\npotential risk and developer response) in terms of bugs with 15 popularly-used\nthird-party libraries. This analysis aims to quantify the potential risk of\nusing outdated libraries and the developer response to the risk. Our findings\nfrom the three analyses provide practical insights to developers and\nresearchers on problems and potential solutions in maintaining third-party\nlibraries (e.g., smart alerting and automated updating of outdated libraries).\nTo demonstrate the usefulness of our findings, we propose a bug-driven alerting\nsystem for assisting developers to make confident decisions in updating\nthird-party library versions.

Understanding the dynamics of lying is therefore of crucial importance\nacross different fields of research. While lying has been studied before in\nwell-mixed populations, it is a fact that real interactions are rarely\nwell-mixed. Indeed, they are usually structured and thus best described by\nnetworks. Here we therefore use the Monte Carlo method to study the evolution\nof lying in the sender-receiver game in a one-parameter family of networks,\nsystematically covering complete networks, small-world networks, and\none-dimensional rings. We show that lies which benefit the sender at a cost to\nthe receiver, the so-called black lies, are less likely to proliferate on\nnetworks than they do in well-mixed populations. Honesty is thus more likely to\nevolve, but only when the benefit for the sender is smaller than the cost for\nthe receiver. Moreover, this effect is particularly strong in small-world\nnetworks, but less so in the one-dimensional ring. For lies that favor the\nreceiver at a cost to the sender, the so-called altruistic white lies, we show\nthat honesty is also more likely to evolve than it is in well-mixed\npopulations. But contrary to black lies, this effect is more expressed in the\none-dimensional ring, whereas in small-world networks it is present only when\nthe cost to the sender is greater than the benefit for the receiver. Lastly,\nfor lies that benefit both the sender and the receiver, the so-called Pareto\nwhite lies, we show that the network structure actually favors the evolution of\nlying, but this only when the benefit for the sender is slightly greater than\nthe benefit for the receiver. In this case again the small-world topology acts\nas an amplifier of the effect, while other network topologies fail to do the\nsame.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 17:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

The dependence on the stellar host mass is\nparticularly interesting because, at least in principle, gap opening around low\nmass stars should be possible for lower mass planets, giving us a look into the\nyoung, low mass planet population. Using dusty hydrodynamical simulations, we\nfind however the opposite behaviour, as a result of the fact that discs around\nlow mass stars are geometrically thicker: gap opening around low mass stars can\nrequire more massive planets. Depending on the theoretical isochrone employed\nto predict the relationship between stellar mass and luminosity, the gap\nopening planet mass could also be independent of stellar mass, but in no case\nwe find that gap opening becomes easier around low mass stars.

Our approach is based on an extension of the conventional\nLippmann-Schwinger formalism to systems with a periodically time dependent\nHamiltonian. As a key result, we obtain a systematic perturbation scheme for\nthe Floquet scattering amplitudes that describe the transition of a transport\ncarrier through a periodically driven sample.

In the medium adversary regime,\nwith more training data, the generalization loss exhibits a double descent\ncurve, which implies the existence of an intermediate stage where more training\ndata hurts the generalization.

As training a good model often needs massive high-quality data\nand computation resources, the learned models often have significant business\nvalues. However, these valuable deep models are exposed to a huge risk of\ninfringements. For example, if the attacker has the full information of one\ntarget model including the network structure and weights, the model can be\neasily finetuned on new datasets. Even if the attacker can only access the\noutput of the target model, he/she can still train another similar surrogate\nmodel by generating a large scale of input-output training pairs. How to\nprotect the intellectual property of deep models is a very important but\nseriously under-researched problem. There are a few recent attempts at\nclassification network protection only. In this paper, we propose the first\nmodel watermarking framework for protecting image processing models. To achieve\nthis goal, we leverage the spatial invisible watermarking mechanism.\nSpecifically, given a black-box target model, a unified and invisible watermark\nis hidden into its outputs, which can be regarded as a special task-agnostic\nbarrier. In this way, when the attacker trains one surrogate model by using the\ninput-output pairs of the target model, the hidden watermark will be learned\nand extracted afterward. To enable watermarks from binary bits to\nhigh-resolution images, both traditional and deep spatial invisible\nwatermarking mechanism are considered. Experiments demonstrate the robustness\nof the proposed watermarking mechanism, which can resist surrogate models\nlearned with different network structures and objective functions. Besides deep\nmodels, the proposed method is also easy to be extended to protect data and\ntraditional image processing algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 18:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

We find\nthat our model, without the need of light echoing, can well reproduce the\nobserved UV to X-ray lags and the optical to UV lags simultaneously in four\nlocal Seyfert galaxies, including NGC 4151, NGC 4395, NGC 4593, and NGC 5548.\nIn our scenario, relatively larger UV to X-ray lag is expected for AGN with\nsmaller innermost disk radius and thus more compact corona. Interestingly, for\nthese Seyfert galaxies studied in this work, sources with relatively larger UV\nto X-ray lags do have broader Fe Ka lines, indicative of relativistic\nbroadening due to more compact corona and smaller innermost disk radius. If\nconfirmed with more X-ray and UV monitoring campaigns, this interesting\ndiscovery would provide a new probe to the inner disk/corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

In this work we perform a Hamiltonian\nray tracing study investigating the dynamics of magneto-gravity waves in full\nspherical geometry, using realistic stellar models and magnetic field\nconfigurations. This technique applies in the limit where wavelengths are much\nshorter than scales of background variation. We conduct a comprehensive\nexploration of parameter space, examining the roles of wave frequency,\nspherical harmonic degree, wavevector polarisation, incoming latitude, field\nstrength, field radius, and evolutionary state. We demonstrate that even in the\npresence of a strong field, there exist trajectories where waves remain\npredominantly gravity-like in character, and these are able to undergo\nreflection out of the core much like pure gravity waves. The remaining\ntrajectories are ones where waves acquire significant Alfven character,\nbecoming trapped and eventually dissipated. Orientation effects, i.e.\nwavevector polarisation and incoming latitude, are found to be crucial factors\nin determining the outcome (trapped versus reflected) of individual wave\npackets. The allowance for partial energy return from the core offers a\nsolution to the conundrum faced by the magnetic hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

It has been suggested that this depletion is a signpost of\nplanet formation. The exoplanet statistics are now good enough to show that the\norigin of this depletion does not arise from the sequestration of refractory\nmaterial inside the planets themselves. This conclusion arises because most\nsun-like stars host close-in planetary systems that are on average more massive\nthan the Sun's. Using evolutionary models for the protoplanetary discs that\nsurrounded the young Sun and solar twins we demonstrate that the origin of the\ndepletion likely arises due to the trapping of dust exterior to the orbit of a\nforming giant planet. In this scenario a forming giant planet opens a gap in\nthe gas disc, creating a pressure trap. If the planet forms early enough, while\nthe disc is still massive, the planet can trap $\\gtrsim 100 $M$_\\oplus$ of dust\nexterior to its orbit, preventing the dust from accreting onto the star in\ncontrast to the gas.

Buyers' valuations for an item depend on the\ncontext that describes the item. However, the seller is not aware of the\nrelationship between the context and buyers' valuations, i.e., buyers'\npreferences. The seller's goal is to design a learning policy to set reserve\nprices via observing the past sales data, and her objective is to minimize her\nregret for revenue, where the regret is computed against a clairvoyant policy\nthat knows buyers' heterogeneous preferences. Given the seller's goal,\nutility-maximizing buyers have the incentive to bid untruthfully in order to\nmanipulate the seller's learning policy. We propose learning policies that are\nrobust to such strategic behavior. These policies use the outcomes of the\nauctions, rather than the submitted bids, to estimate the preferences while\ncontrolling the long-term effect of the outcome of each auction on the future\nreserve prices.

Mathematical description within the grand\ncanonical ensemble is illustrated by an example of the Morse interaction\npotential possessing the Fourier transform.

The grand partition function,\nthermodynamic potential, and equation of state of the model near the critical\npoint are derived taking into account the non-Gaussian (quartic) distribution\nof order parameter fluctuations.

To address\nthis challenge, there is a need for tools that can model the functional impact\nof non-idealities on DNN training and inference. Existing efforts towards this\ngoal are either limited to inference, or are too slow to be used for\nlarge-scale DNN training. We propose TxSim, a fast and customizable modeling\nframework to functionally evaluate DNN training on crossbar-based hardware\nconsidering the impact of non-idealities. The key features of TxSim that\ndifferentiate it from prior efforts are: (i) It comprehensively models\nnon-idealities during all training operations (forward propagation, backward\npropagation, and weight update) and (ii) it achieves computational efficiency\nby mapping crossbar evaluations to well-optimized BLAS routines and\nincorporates speedup techniques to further reduce simulation time with minimal\nimpact on accuracy. TxSim achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement in\nsimulation speed over prior works, and thereby makes it feasible to evaluate\ntraining of large-scale DNNs on crossbars. Our experiments using TxSim reveal\nthat the accuracy degradation in DNN training due to non-idealities can be\nsubstantial (3%-10%) for large-scale DNNs, underscoring the need for further\nresearch in mitigation techniques.

In particular, we\nfocus on the Bayesian Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and demonstrate how to adapt\nthe piecewise-constant SBM graphon to the smoothed version.

More importantly, we find\nthat 3D effects lead to a dramatic change in the behaviour of the dynamical\ncorotation torque compared to earlier 2D theory and simulations. Although it\nwas previously shown that the dynamical corotation torque could act to slow and\nessentially stall the inward migration of a low-mass planet, our results in 3D\nshow that the dynamical corotation torque has the complete opposite effect and\nspeeds up inward migration. Our numerical experiments implicate buoyancy\nresonances as the cause. These have two effects: (i) they exert a direct torque\non the planet, whose magnitude relative to the Lindblad torque is measured in\nour simulations to be small; (ii) they torque the gas librating on horseshoe\norbits in the corotation region and drive evolution of its vortensity, leading\nto the negative dynamical corotation torque. This indicates that at low\nturbulent viscosity, the detailed vertical thermal structure of the\nprotoplanetary disc plays an important role in determining the migration\nbehaviour of embedded planets.

Until recently, most FRBs have been detected at frequencies\ngreater than 1 GHz with a few exceptions at 800 MHz. The recent discoveries of\nFRBs at 400 MHz from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)\ntelescope has opened up possibilities for new insights about the progenitors\nwhile many other low frequency surveys in the past have failed to find any\nFRBs. Here, we present results from a FRB survey recently conducted at the\nJodrell Bank Observatory at 332 MHz with the 76-m Lovell telescope for a total\nof 58 days. We did not detect any FRBs in the survey and report a 90$\\%$ upper\nlimit of 5500 FRBs per day per sky for a Euclidean Universe above a fluence\nthreshold of 46 Jy ms. We discuss the possibility of absorption as the main\ncause of non-detections in low frequency (< 800 MHz) searches and invoke\ndifferent absorption models to explain the same. We find that Induced Compton\nScattering alone cannot account for absorption of radio emission and that our\nsimulations favour a combination of Induced Compton Scattering and Free-Free\nAbsorption to explain the non-detections. For a free-free absorption scenario,\nour constraints on the electron density are consistent with those expected in\nthe post-shock region of the ionized ejecta in Super-Luminous SuperNovae\n(SLSNe).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 21:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

We show that, within a nonmagnetic\ndescription of the paramagnetic phase, the MEET gives an overall good\ndescription of the photoemission spectrum at ambient pressure as well as the\nchanges it undergoes by increasing pressure. In particular at ambient pressure\nthe band gap opens between the mixed Fe $t_{2g}$ and O $2p$ states and the Fe\n4s states and, moreover, a $d$-$d$ gap opens, which is compatible with a\nhigh-spin configuration (hence nonzero local magnetic moments as observed in\nexperiment), whereas decreasing pressure the band gap tends to close, $t_{2g}$\nstates tend to become fully occupied and $e_{g}$ fully unoccupied, which is\ncompatible with a low-spin configuration (hence a collapse of the magnetic\nmoments as observed in experiment). This is a remarkable result, since, within\na nonmagnetic description of the paramagnetic phase, the MEET is capable to\ncorrectly describe the photoemission spectrum and the spin configuration at\nambient as well as high pressure. For comparison we report the band gap values\nobtained using density-functional theory with a hybrid functional containing\nscreened exchange (HSE06) and a variant of the $GW$ method (self-consistent\nCOHSEX), which are reliable for the description of the antiferromagnetic phase.\nBoth methods open a gap at ambient pressure, although, by construction, they\ngive a low-spin configuration; increasing pressure they correctly describes the\nband gap closing.

In this paper, an adaptive design of beam training,\ndata transmission and handover is proposed, that learns and exploits these\ntemporal correlations to reduce the beam training overhead and optimally\ntrade-off throughput and power consumption. At each time-slot, the serving base\nstation (BS) decides to perform either beam training, data communication, or\nhandover when blockage is detected, under uncertainty in the system state.

To address the high dimensional optimization, an approximate\nconstrained point-based value iteration (C-PBVI) method is developed, which\nsimultaneously optimizes the primal and dual functions to meet the power\nconstraint. Numerical results demonstrate a good match between the analysis and\na simulation based on 2D mobility and 3D analog beamforming via uniform planar\narrays at both BSs and UE, and reveal that C-PBVI performs near-optimally, and\noutperforms a baseline scheme with periodic beam training by 38% in spectral\nefficiency.

Again, it is unknown how to\nincorporate the expert prior knowledge about the global optimum into Bayesian\noptimization process. To address it, we represent the expert knowledge about\nthe global optimum via placing a prior distribution on it and we then derive\nits posterior distribution. An efficient Bayesian optimization approach has\nbeen proposed via posterior sampling on the posterior distribution of the\nglobal optimum. We theoretically analyze the convergence of the proposed\nalgorithm and discuss the robustness of incorporating expert prior. We evaluate\nthe efficiency of our algorithm by optimizing synthetic functions and tuning\nhyperparameters of classifiers along with a real-world experiment on the\nsynthesis of short polymer fiber. The results clearly demonstrate the\nadvantages of our proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 01:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-27"}

It suggests that merger or strong\ninteraction might be the main driving mechanism of compaction at higher\nredshifts, whereas the disk instability of individual galaxies might play a\nmore important role on the formation of cSFGs at lower redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 03:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

Having access to this graph, which is\nsometimes trivially evident from domain knowledge, provides a better\nrepresentation of the data and facilitates various information processing\ntasks. However, in cases where the underlying graph is unavailable, it needs to\nbe learned from the data itself for data representation, data processing and\ninference purposes. Existing literature on learning graphs from data has mostly\nconsidered arbitrary graphs, whereas the graphs generating real-world data tend\nto have additional structure that can be incorporated in the graph learning\nprocedure. Structure-aware graph learning methods require learning fewer\nparameters and have the potential to reduce computational, memory and sample\ncomplexities. In light of this, the focus of this paper is to devise a method\nto learn structured graphs from data that are given in the form of product\ngraphs. Product graphs arise naturally in many real-world datasets and provide\nan efficient and compact representation of large-scale graphs through several\nsmaller factor graphs. To this end, first the graph learning problem is posed\nas a linear program, which (on average) outperforms the state-of-the-art graph\nlearning algorithms. This formulation is of independent interest itself as it\nshows that graph learning is possible through a simple linear program.\nAfterwards, an alternating minimization-based algorithm aimed at learning\nvarious types of product graphs is proposed, and local convergence guarantees\nto the true solution are established for this algorithm. Finally the\nperformance gains, reduced sample complexity, and inference capabilities of the\nproposed algorithm over existing methods are also validated through numerical\nsimulations on synthetic and real datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 03:25:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 21:16:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

Stellar\nevolution models predict a dearth of BHs both at masses $\\gtrsim 50$ M$_\\odot$\nand $\\lesssim 5$ M$_\\odot$, thus leaving low- and high-mass gaps in the BH mass\nfunction. A natural way to form BHs of these masses is through mergers of\nneutron stars (NSs; for the low-mass gap) or lower-mass BHs (for the high-mass\ngap); the low- or high-mass-gap BH produced as a merger product can then be\ndetected by LIGO-Virgo if it merges again with a new companion. We show that\nthe evolution of a 2+2 quadruple system can naturally lead to BH mergers with\ncomponent masses in the low- or high-mass gaps. In our scenario, the BH in the\nmass gap originates from the merger of two NSs, or two BHs, in one of the two\nbinaries and the merger product is imparted a recoil kick (from anisotropic\ngravitational wave emission), which triggers its interaction with the other\nbinary component of the quadruple system. The outcome of this three-body\ninteraction is usually a new eccentric compact binary containing the BH in the\nmass gap, which can then merge again. The merger rate is $\\sim 10^{-7} -\n10^{-2}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ and $\\sim 10^{-3} - 10^{-2}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$\nfor BHs in the low-mass and high-mass gap, respectively.

In this paper, we simultaneously address these challenges\nby proposing a new Determinantal Point Processes based loss function for\nprobabilistic modeling of diversity and quality. With this new loss function,\nwe develop a variant of the Generative Adversarial Network, named \"Performance\nAugmented Diverse Generative Adversarial Network\" or PaDGAN, which can generate\nnovel high-quality designs with good coverage of the design space. Using three\nsynthetic examples and one real-world airfoil design example, we demonstrate\nthat PaDGAN can generate diverse and high-quality designs. In comparison to a\nvanilla Generative Adversarial Network, on average, it generates samples with a\n28% higher mean quality score with larger diversity and without the mode\ncollapse issue. Unlike typical generative models that usually generate new\ndesigns by interpolating within the boundary of training data, we show that\nPaDGAN expands the design space boundary outside the training data towards\nhigh-quality regions.

The statistical properties of these generators are strong, as\nthey pass BigCrush and PractRand -- the most stringent test suites available.\nIn addition, Romu generators take maximum advantage of instruction-level\nparallelism in modern superscalar processors, giving them an output latency of\nzero clock-cycles when inlined, thus adding no delay to an application.\nScaled-down versions of these generators can be created and tested, enabling\none to estimate the maximum number of values the full-size generators can\nsupply before their randomness declines, ensuring the success of large jobs.\nSuch capacity-estimates are rare for conventional PRNGs. A linear PRNG has a\nsingle cycle of states of known length comprising almost all possible states.\nHowever, a Romu generator computes pseudo-random permutations of those states,\ncreating multiple cycles with pseudo-random lengths which cannot be determined\nby theory. But the ease of creating state-sizes of 128 or more bits allows (1)\nshort cycles to be constrained to vanishingly low probabilities, and (2)\nthousands of parallel streams to be created having infinitesimal probabilities\nof overlap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 07:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-27"}

However,\nthe vanilla gates in RNN (e.g., the input gate in LSTM) suffer from the problem\nof gate undertraining, which can be caused by various factors, such as the\nsaturating activation functions, the gate layouts (e.g., the gate number and\ngating functions), or even the suboptimal memory state etc.. Those may result\nin failures of learning gating switch roles and thus the weak performance. In\nthis paper, we propose a new gating mechanism within general gated recurrent\nneural networks to handle this issue.

The refining mechanism allows enhancing gradient\nback-propagation as well as extending the gating activation scope, which can\nguide RNN to reach possibly deeper minima.

In the puzzle game, the solver often put pieces together in a\nlogical way according to the contextual information of each piece, in order to\narrive at the correct solution.

First, by using the packet-oriented\noperation for the overlap packets when they conflict in a slot interval, we\nintroduce the packet-based polarization transform and prove that this transform\nis independent of the packet's length. Second, guided by the packet-based\npolarization, an SP assignment (SPA) method with the variable slot erasure\nprobability (SEP) and a SPA method with a fixed SEP value are designed for the\nPSA scheme. Then, a packet-oriented successive cancellation (pSC) and a pSC\nlist (pSCL) decoding algorithm are developed.

The correction\nnetwork removes noise and adjusts the kernel of the inputted LR image; then,\nthe corrected clean LR image is upscaled by the SR network. In the training\nphase, the correction network also produces a pseudo-clean LR image from the\ninputted HR image, and then a mapping from the pseudo-clean LR image to the\ninputted HR image is learned by the SR network in a paired manner.

Recent advances in near and far field\nmicroscopy have offered several ways to overcome this limitation; however, they\noften use invasive markers and require intricate equipment with complicated\nimage post-processing. On the other hand, a simple marker-free solution for\nhigh-resolution imaging may be found by exploiting resonant metamaterial lenses\nthat can convert the subwavelength image information contained in the\nnear-field of the object to propagating field components that can reach the far\nfield. Unfortunately, resonant metalenses are inevitably sensitive to\nabsorption losses, which has so far largely hindered their practical\napplications.

The\nlocalization of the target vertebral level (i.e. the position of a vertebra in\na spine) is typically done by back palpation or under X-ray guidance, yielding\neither higher chances of procedure failure or exposure to ionizing radiation.\nPreliminary studies have been conducted in the literature, suggesting that\nultrasound imaging may be a precise and safe alternative to X-ray for spine\nlevel detection. However, ultrasound data are noisy and complicated to\ninterpret. In this study, a robotic-ultrasound approach for automatic vertebral\nlevel detection is introduced. The method relies on the fusion of ultrasound\nand force data, thus providing both \"tactile\" and visual feedback during the\nprocedure, which results in higher performances in presence of data corruption.\nA robotic arm automatically scans the volunteer's back along the spine by using\nforce-ultrasound data to locate vertebral levels. The occurrences of vertebral\nlevels are visible on the force trace as peaks, which are enhanced by properly\ncontrolling the force applied by the robot on the patient back. Ultrasound data\nare processed with a Deep Learning method to extract a 1D signal modelling the\nprobabilities of having a vertebra at each location along the spine. Processed\nforce and ultrasound data are fused using a 1D Convolutional Network to compute\nthe location of the vertebral levels. The method is compared to pure image and\npure force-based methods for vertebral level counting, showing improved\nperformance. In particular, the fusion method is able to correctly classify\n100% of the vertebral levels in the test set, while pure image and pure\nforce-based method could only classify 80% and 90% vertebrae, respectively. The\npotential of the proposed method is evaluated in an exemplary simulated\nclinical application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 10:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-27"}

First, we obtain a strengthening of the\nPPA-hardness result of [Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg, 2019], to the case when\nagents have piecewise uniform valuations with only two blocks. We obtain this\nresult via a new reduction, which is in fact conceptually much simpler than the\ncorresponding one in [Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg, 2019]. Then, we consider the\ncase of single-block (uniform) valuations and provide a parameterized\npolynomial time algorithm for solving $\\varepsilon$-Consensus-Halving for any\n$\\varepsilon$, as well as a polynomial-time algorithm for $\\varepsilon=1/2$.\nFinally, an important application of our new techniques is the first hardness\nresult for a generalization of Consensus-Halving, the Consensus-$1/k$-Division\nproblem [Simmons and Su, 2003]. In particular, we prove that\n$\\varepsilon$-Consensus-$1/3$-Division is PPAD-hard.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 12:43:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 16:24:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 22:43:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 19:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

The {\\em inefficiency} of a deviator\nrule $S$ is the maximum ratio, over all initial profiles $p$, between the\nsocial cost of the worst equilibrium reachable by $S$ from $p$ and the social\ncost of the best equilibrium reachable from $p$.

The superflow in the polar phase is found to be\nstable up to a finite critical velocity $v_{\\rm c}\\approx 0.2\\,$cm/s, despite\nthe zero value of the Landau critical velocity. We suggest that the stability\nof the superflow above $v_{\\mathrm{cL}}$ but below $v_{\\rm c}$ is provided by\nthe accumulation of the flow-induced quasiparticles into pockets in the\nmomentum space, bounded by Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. In the polar phase this\nsurface has non-trivial topology which includes two pseudo-Weyl points.\nVortices forming above the critical velocity are strongly pinned in the\nconfining matrix, used to stabilize the polar phase, and hence stable\nmacroscopic superflow can be maintained even when the external drive is brought\nto zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 14:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 18:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

Often there are no object models, and, especially with cluttered\nirregularly shaped objects, the robot can not create a model of the scene due\nto occlusion. One of our key insights is that based on previous sensory input\nwe are only interested in moving an object out of the disentanglement around\nobstacles. That is, we only need to know where the robot can successfully move\nin order to plan the disentangling. Due to the uncertainty we integrate\ninformation about blocked movements into a probability map. The map defines the\nprobability of the robot successfully moving to a specific configuration. Using\nas cost the failure probability of a sequence of movements we can then plan and\nexecute disentangling iteratively. Since our approach circumvents only\npreviously encountered obstacles, new movements will yield information about\nunknown obstacles that block movement until the robot has learned to circumvent\nall obstacles and disentangling succeeds. In the experiments, we use a special\nprobabilistic version of the Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm for\nplanning and demonstrate successful disentanglement of objects both in 2-D and\n3-D simulation, and, on a KUKA LBR 7-DOF robot.

Prior\ntaxonomies that focus on specific scenarios, e.g., indiscriminate or targeted,\nhave enabled defenses for the corresponding subset of known attacks. Yet, this\nintroduces an inevitable arms race between adversaries and defenders. In this\nwork, we study the feasibility of an attack-agnostic defense relying on\nartifacts that are common to all poisoning attacks. Specifically, we focus on a\ncommon element between all attacks: they modify gradients computed to train the\nmodel. We identify two main artifacts of gradients computed in the presence of\npoison: (1) their $\\ell_2$ norms have significantly higher magnitudes than\nthose of clean gradients, and (2) their orientation differs from clean\ngradients. Based on these observations, we propose the prerequisite for a\ngeneric poisoning defense: it must bound gradient magnitudes and minimize\ndifferences in orientation. We call this gradient shaping. As an exemplar tool\nto evaluate the feasibility of gradient shaping, we use differentially private\nstochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), which clips and perturbs individual\ngradients during training to obtain privacy guarantees. We find that DP-SGD,\neven in configurations that do not result in meaningful privacy guarantees,\nincreases the model's robustness to indiscriminate attacks. It also mitigates\nworst-case targeted attacks and increases the adversary's cost in multi-poison\nscenarios. The only attack we find DP-SGD to be ineffective against is a\nstrong, yet unrealistic, indiscriminate attack. Our results suggest that, while\nwe currently lack a generic poisoning defense, gradient shaping is a promising\ndirection for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 14:04:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-02"}

Both the gas-to-particle\nconversion and droplet-to-particle conversion routes of different solution\nproperties are investigated, together with the population balance model and the\ndroplet drying model. For multi-component droplets without precursors, the\ndroplet combustion is limited by the species diffusion in the liquid phase. The\nmodel can well predict the droplet shrinkage history observed by previous PDA\nmeasurements. For the precursor with a low boiling point than its thermal\ndecomposition temperature, the precursor in the droplet can then transform into\nnanoparticles through the gas-to-particle conversion route. The population\nbalance model reveals that the generated nanoparticle size relies on both the\nprecursor mass fraction and the residence time, which is consistent with the\nvapor-fed aerosol flame synthesis. For the precursor that tends to decompose or\nprecipitate in the liquid, it then undergoes the droplet-to-particle conversion\nroute. The droplet behavior can be classified by the ratio of droplet\nevaporation time and precursor reaction or precipitation time. For small\ndroplets with short evaporation time, the nanoparticle formation obeys the\none-droplet-one-particle rule. For large droplets with long evaporation time,\nthe competition among precipitation, thermal decomposition, and evaporation\ndetermines the final nanoparticle morphology. The single droplet model\nestablished in this study can potentially guide the precursor design and be\ncoupled with the turbulent flame simulation of the whole flame spray pyrolysis\nburner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 14:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-27"}

In this centrosymmetric material, SHG can occur due to constructive\ninterplay of electric dipole and electric quadrupole/magnetic dipole\ntransitions for light propagating along the low-symmetry directions [111] or\n[112]. By application of a magnetic field in Voigt configuration, SHG gets also\nallowed for excitation along the [110]-axis and even the high-symmetry cubic\ndirection [001]. Combining a symmetry analysis and a microscopic theory, we\nuncover the two key contributions to the magnetic-field-induced SHG: the Zeeman\neffect and the magneto-Stark effect. We demonstrate systematic dependencies of\nthe SHG intensity on the linear polarization angles of the ingoing fundamental\nlaser and the outgoing SHG beam.

In this paper, we\nempirically study this phenomenon in the setting of adversarially trained deep\nnetworks, which are trained to minimize the loss under worst-case adversarial\nperturbations. We find that overfitting to the training set does in fact harm\nrobust performance to a very large degree in adversarially robust training\nacross multiple datasets (SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet) and\nperturbation models ($\\ell_\\infty$ and $\\ell_2$). Based upon this observed\neffect, we show that the performance gains of virtually all recent algorithmic\nimprovements upon adversarial training can be matched by simply using early\nstopping. We also show that effects such as the double descent curve do still\noccur in adversarially trained models, yet fail to explain the observed\noverfitting. Finally, we study several classical and modern deep learning\nremedies for overfitting, including regularization and data augmentation, and\nfind that no approach in isolation improves significantly upon the gains\nachieved by early stopping.

Unfortunately, any biases present in the data may be learned by the\nmodel, thereby inappropriately transferring that bias into the decision making\nprocess. We identify the connection between the task of bias reduction and that\nof isolating factors common between domains whilst encouraging domain specific\ninvariance. To isolate the common factors we combine the theory of deep latent\nvariable models with information bottleneck theory for scenarios whereby data\nmay be naturally paired across domains and no additional supervision is\nrequired. The result is the Nested Variational AutoEncoder (NestedVAE). Two\nouter VAEs with shared weights attempt to reconstruct the input and infer a\nlatent space, whilst a nested VAE attempts to reconstruct the latent\nrepresentation of one image, from the latent representation of its paired\nimage. In so doing, the nested VAE isolates the common latent factors/causes\nand becomes invariant to unwanted factors that are not shared between paired\nimages. We also propose a new metric to provide a balanced method of evaluating\nconsistency and classifier performance across domains which we refer to as the\nAdjusted Parity metric. An evaluation of NestedVAE on both domain and attribute\ninvariance, change detection, and learning common factors for the prediction of\nbiological sex demonstrates that NestedVAE significantly outperforms\nalternative methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 15:49:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-27"}

In this paper, we introduce a general two-step methodology for\nmodel-based hierarchical clustering. Considering the integrated classification\nlikelihood criterion as an objective function, this work applies to every\ndiscrete latent variable models (DLVMs) where this quantity is tractable. The\nfirst step of the methodology involves maximizing the criterion with respect to\nthe partition. Addressing the known problem of sub-optimal local maxima found\nby greedy hill climbing heuristics, we introduce a new hybrid algorithm based\non a genetic algorithm efficiently exploring the space of solutions. The\nresulting algorithm carefully combines and merges different solutions, and\nallows the joint inference of the number $K$ of clusters as well as the\nclusters themselves. Starting from this natural partition, the second step of\nthe methodology is based on a bottom-up greedy procedure to extract a hierarchy\nof clusters. In a Bayesian context, this is achieved by considering the\nDirichlet cluster proportion prior parameter $\\alpha$ as a regularization term\ncontrolling the granularity of the clustering. A new approximation of the\ncriterion is derived as a log-linear function of $\\alpha$, enabling a simple\nfunctional form of the merge decision criterion.

Here, we\nfirst study this problem on an arbitrary graph and obtain the closed-form\nformula for calculating the theoretical lower bound of average trapping time\n($ATT$), a quantity that evaluates trapping efficiency of graph in question,\nusing methods from spectral graph theory. The results show that the choice of\nthe trap's location has a significant influence on determining parameter $ATT$.\nAs a result, we consider the problem on star-type graphs, a special graph\nfamily which will be introduced shortly, with a single trap $\\theta$ and then\nderive using probability generating functions the exact solution to quantity\n$ATT$. Our results suggest that all star-type graphs have most optimal trapping\nefficiency by achieving the corresponding theoretical lower bounds of $ATT$.\nMore importantly, we further find that a given graph is most optimal only if\nits underlying structure is star-type when considering the trapping problem. At\nmeantime, we also provide the upper bounds for $ATT$ of several graphs in terms\nof well-known Holder inequality, some of which are sharp. By using all the\nconsequences obtained, one may be able to design better control scheme for\ncomplex networks from respect of trapping efficiency, to some extent, which are\nin well agreement with many other previous thoughts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 06:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-28"}

Starting from trivial entropy that is\ngeneralized by Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, the entropic mass of matter emerges\nnaturally together with Unruh temperature. The key idea is that the cause of\nmass formation comes down to trivial entropy, and mass density is just the\nexternal manifestation of mass. The full Einstein equation with the\ncosmological constant is derived from the requirement that entropic mass and\nproper mass are equivalent. This perspective suggests that trivial entropy that\ncauses mass in gravitation may be the best choice for the origin of space-time\ngeometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 07:31:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 09:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

We used a bi-modal approach by fusing audio and\nvisual features and train a sequence-to-sequence model that is based on Gated\nRecurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. We show\nexperimental results on validation data. The overall accuracy of the proposed\napproach is 41.5 \\%, which is better than the competition baseline of 37\\%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 07:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

To accomplish this, we cast the problem of\nimitation with autonomous improvement into a multi-task setting.

This allows us to leverage the\nrobot's own trials as demonstrations for tasks other than the one that the\nrobot actually attempted. Using an initial dataset of multi-task demonstration\ndata, the robot autonomously collects trials which are only sparsely labeled\nwith a binary indication of whether the trial accomplished any useful task or\nnot.

The core issue is the scale separation acting as a barrier that\nhampers the propagation of the information across model components. We provide\na brief survey of CDA, and then focus on CDA using the ensemble Kalman filter\n(EnKF). We consider first coupled equations with temporal scale difference and\ndeduce that: (i) cross components effects are strong from the slow to the fast\nscale, but, (ii) intra-component effects are much stronger in the fast scale.\nWhile observing the slow scale is desirable and benefits the fast, the latter\nmust be observed with high frequency otherwise the error will affect the slow\nscale. Experiments are performed using the atmosphere-ocean model, MAOOAM. Six\nconfigurations are considered, differing for the strength of the\natmosphere-ocean coupling and/or the number of model modes. A comprehensive\ndynamical characterisation of the model configurations is provided by examining\nthe Lyapunov spectrum, Kolmogorov entropy and Kaplan-Yorke attractor dimension.\nWe also compute the covariant Lyapunov vectors and use them to explain how\nmodel instabilities act on different model's modes according to the coupling\nstrength.

The relation between the ensemble size and the\nunstable subspace dimension has been studied.

As a single level\nsegmentation algorithm, this method avoids over segmentation and retains\ndetails by the same time. It is named because of that it simulates a flooding\nfrom underground destroys dams between water-pools. We treat edge detection\nresults as strengthening structure of a dam if it is on the dam. To simulate a\nflooding from underground, regions are merged by ascending order of the average\ngra-dient inside the region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 04:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

From the image metadata and using computer vision tools, we can\nextract distinct insights for each user to build a personal profile. Using the\nunderlying connection between cuisines and their inherent tastes, we attempt to\ndevelop such a profile for an individual based solely on the images of his\nfood.
