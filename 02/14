Molecules offer transitions which allow tests that are not\npossible in atomic systems. However, usually precision spectroscopy of\nmolecules is challenging due to the lack of cycling transitions for state\npreparation and state detection. For molecular ions, this obstacle can be\novercome by quantum logic spectroscopy, where dissipation for state preparation\nand detection is provided by a co-trapped atomic ion exploiting the shared\neigenstates of motion. Here, we propose a full quantum logic spectroscopy\nscheme for molecular oxygen ions and theoretically investigate the feasibility\nof quantum logic assisted state detection and preparation. Furthermore, we\nprovide coupling rates for a direct single-photon quadrupole excitation of a\nvibrational overtone transition that can serve as a sensitive transition for\ntests of a possible variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 16:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-14"}

This effect is found to be significant. It explains the large\nsensitivity of the fluctuations of longitudinal and spanwise velocities to\nvariations in the Reynolds number in comparison with the sensitivity of the\nmean velocity, the Reynolds stress, and the wall-normal velocity fluctuations.\nThe analysis shows that the variation of the longitudinal velocity fluctuations\nwith the Reynolds number is dominated by the variation of the amplitude and\nwall-normal-scale modulation of the universal mean velocity profile by the\nouter, large-scale, Reynolds-number-dependent motions. The variation of\nspanwise velocity fluctuations is dominated by the fluctuations of the\ndirection of the large-scale component of the wall friction. The Reynolds\nnumber dependence of the other second moments is not dominated by these\nmechanisms because the mean wall-normal velocity and the mean spanwise velocity\nare zero. Explicit relationships between the differences in the second moments\nof velocity in any two high-Reynolds-number near-wall flows were derived.

We looked at\nsorting networks, at how they can improve the speed of sorting few elements,\nand how to implement them in an efficient manner by using conditional moves.\nSince sorting networks need to be implemented explicitly for each set size,\nproviding networks for larger sizes becomes less efficient due to increased\ncode sizes. To also enable the sorting of slightly larger base cases, we\nadapted sample sort to Register Sample Sort, to break down those larger sets\ninto sizes that can in turn be sorted by sorting networks.

This brings the need of designing efficient\nprocedures for comparing rooted trees representing the evolution of mutations\nin tumor phylogenies. Bernardini et al. [CPM 2019] recently introduced a notion\nof the rearrangement distance for fully-labelled trees motivated by this\nnecessity. This notion originates from two operations: one that permutes the\nlabels of the nodes, the other that affects the topology of the tree. Each\noperation alone defines a distance that can be computed in polynomial time,\nwhile the actual rearrangement distance, that combines the two, was proven to\nbe NP-hard.\n  We answer two open question left unanswered by the previous work. First, what\nis the complexity of computing the permutation distance? Second, is there a\nconstant-factor approximation algorithm for estimating the rearrangement\ndistance between two arbitrary trees? We answer the first one by showing, via a\ntwo-way reduction, that calculating the permutation distance between two trees\non $n$ nodes is equivalent, up to polylogarithmic factors, to finding the\nlargest cardinality matching in a sparse bipartite graph. In particular, by\nplugging in the algorithm of Liu and Sidford [ArXiv 2020], we obtain an\n$O(n^{4/3+o(1)})$ time algorithm for computing the permutation distance between\ntwo trees on $n$ nodes.

Correspondingly, we find three distinct types of\ndynamical behavior, namely the sustained chaos, transient chaos and non-chaotic\nregion, as clearly exhibited by different geometrical shapes in the heat map of\nOTOC. To quantify such differences, we look at instantaneous speed (IS), finite\ntime Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) and velocity dependent Lyapunov exponents (VDLE)\nextracted from OTOC.

The evaluation\nprocedure promoted by their authors consists in measuring performance\nindicators for each video separately and to average them hierarchically, within\na category first, then between categories, a procedure which we name\n\"summarization\". While the summarization by averaging performance indicators is\na valuable effort to standardize the evaluation procedure, it has no\ntheoretical justification and it breaks the intrinsic relationships between\nsummarized indicators. This leads to interpretation inconsistencies. In this\npaper, we present a theoretical approach to summarize the performances for\nmultiple videos that preserves the relationships between performance\nindicators. In addition, we give formulas and an algorithm to calculate\nsummarized performances. Finally, we showcase our observations on CDNET 2014.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 17:35:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 15:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

However, traditional methods are often limited due\nto image resolution and artifacts.\n  We propose a Convolutional Neural Regressor (CNR) that provides\ncross-sectional measurement of airway lumen, airway wall thickness, and vessel\nradius. CNR is trained with data created by a generative model of synthetic\nstructures which is used in combination with Simulated and Unsupervised\nGenerative Adversarial Network (SimGAN) to create simulated and refined airways\nand vessels with known ground-truth.\n  For validation, we first use synthetically generated airways and vessels\nproduced by the proposed generative model to compute the relative error and\ndirectly evaluate the accuracy of CNR in comparison with traditional methods.\nThen, in-vivo validation is performed by analyzing the association between the\npercentage of the predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1\\%) and\nthe value of the Pi10 parameter, two well-known measures of lung function and\nairway disease, for airways. For vessels, we assess the correlation between our\nestimate of the small-vessel blood volume and the lungs' diffusing capacity for\ncarbon monoxide (DLCO).\n  The results demonstrate that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) provide a\npromising direction for accurately measuring vessels and airways on chest CT\nimages with physiological correlates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 18:45:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 16:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-13"}

In\norder to meet the basic requirement of traditional learning models, structural\ndata generally have to be converted into fix-length vectors in a handcrafted\nmanner, which is tedious and may even incur information loss. A common form of\nstructured data is what we term \"semantic tree-structures\", corresponding to\ndata where rich semantic information is encoded in a compositional manner, such\nas those expressed in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and eXtensible Markup\nLanguage (XML). For tree-structured data, several learning models have been\nstudied to allow for working directly on raw tree-structure data, However such\nlearning models are limited to either a specific tree-topology or a specific\ntree-structured data format, e.g., synthetic parse trees. In this paper, we\npropose a novel framework for end-to-end learning on generic semantic\ntree-structured data of arbitrary topology and heterogeneous data types, such\nas data expressed in JSON, XML and so on. Motivated by the works in recursive\nand recurrent neural networks, we develop exemplar neural implementations of\nour framework for the JSON format. We evaluate our approach on several UCI\nbenchmark datasets, including ablation and data-efficiency studies, and on a\ntoy reinforcement learning task.

The most significant correlation found is for the FWHM of the line and\nthe UV continuum slope of the galaxy, suggesting that the redder galaxies have\nbroader Lya lines. The generally broad and red line shapes found in the halo\ncomponent suggests that the Lya haloes are powered either by scattering\nprocesses through an outflowing medium, fluorescent emission from outflowing\ncold clumps of gas, or a mix of both.

In this paper, we show that the Page curve\ncan result from a simple dynamical input in the evolution of the black hole,\nbased on a recently proposed signature of quantum chaos, without resorting to\ntypicality. Our argument is based on what we refer to as the \"operator gas\"\napproach, which allows one to understand the evolution of the microstate of the\nblack hole from generic features of the Heisenberg evolution of operators. One\nkey feature which leads to the Page curve is the possibility of dynamical\nprocesses where operators in the \"gas\" can \"jump\" outside the black hole, which\nwe refer to as void formation processes.

If the stars are screened but the surrounding dark matter is not,\nthis leads to asymmetry between leading and trailing streams.

The ratio of the\ncumulative number function of stars in the leading and trailing stream as a\nfunction of longitude from the satellite is computable from simulations,\nmeasurable from the stellar data and can provide a direct test. We forecast\nconstraints for streams at large Galactocentric distances, using the specific\nexample case of Hu-Sawicki gravity. Streams with apocentres between 100 and 200\nkpc provide attainable constraints at the level of $|f_{R0}| = 10^{-7}$.

Dynamic protostellar disks\nfeaturing ejections of gaseous clumps and quiescent protoplanetary disks\nexperiencing a close encounter with an intruder star were modeled using the\nnumerical hydrodynamics code FEOSAD. Both the gas and dust dynamics were taken\ninto account, including dust growth and mutual friction between the gas and\ndust components. Only plane-of-the-disk encounters were considered. Ejected\nclumps produce a unique type of tail that is characterized by a bow-shock\nshape. Such tails originate from the supersonic motion of ejected clumps\nthrough the dense envelope that often surrounds young gravitationally unstable\nprotostellar disks. The ejected clumps either sit at the head of the tail-like\nstructure or disperse if their mass is insufficient to withstand the head wind\nof the envelope. On the other hand, close encounters with quiescent\nprotoplanetary disks produce three types of the tail-like structure; we define\nthese as pre-collisional, post-collisional, and spiral tails. These tails can\nin principle be distinguished from one another by particular features of the\ngas and dust flow in and around them.

The plasmodium of P.\npolycephalum is a single-cell that serves as a prosperous bio-computational\nexample. Consequently, it has been successfully utilized in the past to solve a\nvariety of path problems in graphs and combinatorial problems. In this work,\nthis interesting behaviour is mimicked by a robust unconventional computational\nmodel, drawing inspiration from the notion of Cellular and Learning Automata.\nNamely, we employ principles of Cellular Automata (CAs) enriched with learning\ncapabilities to develop a robust computational model, able of modelling\nappropriately the aforementioned biological substrate and, thus, capturing its\ncomputational capabilities. CAs are very efficient in modelling biological\nsystems and solving scientific problems, owing to their ability of incarnating\nessential properties of a system where global behaviour arises as an effect of\nsimple components, interacting locally. The resulting computational tool, after\ncombining CAs with learning capabilities, should be appropriate for modelling\nthe behaviour of living organisms. Thus, the inherent abilities and\ncomputational characteristics of the proposed bio-inspired model are stressed\ntowards the experimental verification of Physarum's ability to model Logic\nGates, while trying to find minimal paths in properly configured mazes with\nfood sources.

Using WiFi signal as an example, we\ndemonstrate that the channel state information (CSI) obtained at the receiver\ncontains rich information about the propagation environment. Through judicious\npre-processing of the estimated CSI followed by deep learning, reliable\npresence detection can be achieved. Several challenges in passive RF sensing\nare addressed. With presence detection, how to collect training data with human\npresence can have a significant impact on the performance. This is in contrast\nto activity detection when a specific motion pattern is of interest. A second\nchallenge is that RF signals are complex-valued. Handling complex-valued input\nin deep learning requires careful data representation and network architecture\ndesign. Finally, human presence affects CSI variation along multiple\ndimensions; such variation, however, is often masked by system impediments such\nas timing or frequency offset. Addressing these challenges, the proposed\nlearning system uses pre-processing to preserve human motion induced channel\nvariation while insulating against other impairments. A convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) properly trained with both magnitude and phase information is\nthen designed to achieve reliable presence detection. Extensive experiments are\nconducted. Using off-the-shelf WiFi devices, the proposed deep learning based\nRF sensing achieves near perfect presence detection during multiple extended\nperiods of test and exhibits superior performance compared with leading edge\npassive infrared sensors. Comparison with existing RF based human presence\ndetection also demonstrates its robustness in performance, especially when\ndeployed in a completely new environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 20:35:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 16:56:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 01:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

I argue that this 'inter-hemispheric imbalance' model arises\nfrom a fundamental misunderstanding of the roles played by inter-hemispheric\n(callosal) projections in mammalian brains. Drawing upon a large body of\nempirical data, derived largely from animal models, and associated theoretical\nmodeling, it is demonstrated that inter-hemispheric projections perform\ncontrast enhancing and integrative functions via mechanisms such as\nsurround/lateral inhibition. The principal functional unit of callosal\ninfluence comprises a facilitatory centre and a depressing peripheral zone,\nthat together shape the influence of converging inputs to pyramidal neurons.\nInter-hemispheric inhibition is an instance of a more general feature of\nmammalian neural systems, whereby inhibitory interneurons act not simply to\nprevent over-excitation but to sculpt the output of specific circuits. The\nnarrowing of the excitatory focus that occurs through crossed surround\ninhibition is a highly conserved motif of transcallosal interactions in\nmammalian sensory and motor cortices. A case is presented that the notion of\n'inter-hemispheric imbalance' has been sustained, and clinical interventions\nderived from this model promoted, by erroneous assumptions concerning that\nrevealed by investigative techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation\n(TMS). The alternative perspective promoted by the present analysis, also\npermits the basis of positive (e.g. post stroke) associations between the\nstructural integrity of transcallosal projections and motor capability to be\nbetter understood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 20:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

We also examine the variations of circuit complexity\nproduced by the same excitations for the free scalar field theory in a fixed\nAdS background.

As a\nnetwork-based sampling method, RDS is faced with the fundamental problem of\nsampling from population networks where features such as homophily (the\ntendency for individuals with similar traits to share social ties) and\ndifferential activity (the ratio of the average number of connections by\nattribute) are sensitive to the choice of a sampling method. Though not clearly\ndescribed in the RDS literature, many simple methods exist to generate\nsimulated RDS data, with specific levels of network features, where the focus\nis on estimating simple estimands. However, the accuracy of these methods in\ntheir abilities to consistently recover those targeted network features remains\nunclear. This is also motivated by recent findings that some population network\nparameters (e.g.~homophily) cannot be consistently estimated from the RDS data\nalone \\citep{Crawford17}.\n  In this paper, we conduct a simulation study to assess the accuracy of\nexisting RDS simulation methods, in terms of their abilities to generate RDS\nsamples with the desired levels of two network parameters: homophily and\ndifferential activity.

Traditionally, developers rely on hardware description\nlanguages like Verilog or VHDL to specify the hardware behavior at the\nregister-transfer level. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) raises the level of\nabstraction, but still requires FPGA design knowledge. Programmers usually\nwrite pragma-annotated C/C++ programs to define the hardware architecture of an\napplication. However, each hardware vendor extends its own C dialect using its\nown vendor-specific set of pragmas. This prevents portability across different\nvendors. Furthermore, pragmas are not first-class citizens in the language.\nThis makes it hard to use them in a modular way or design proper abstractions.\nIn this paper, we present AnyHLS, an approach to synthesize FPGA designs in a\nmodular and abstract way. AnyHLS is able to raise the abstraction level of\nexisting HLS tools by resorting to programming language features such as types\nand higher-order functions as follows: It relies on partial evaluation to\nspecialize and to optimize the user application based on a library of\nabstractions. Then, vendor-specific HLS code is generated for Intel and Xilinx\nFPGAs. Portability is obtained by avoiding any vendor-specific pragmas at the\nsource code.

In particular, Dyna is an\nelegant model-based architecture integrating learning and planning that\nprovides huge flexibility of using a model. One of the most important\ncomponents in Dyna is called search-control, which refers to the process of\ngenerating state or state-action pairs from which we query the model to acquire\nsimulated experiences. Search-control is critical in improving learning\nefficiency. In this work, we propose a simple and novel search-control strategy\nby searching high frequency regions of the value function. Our main intuition\nis built on Shannon sampling theorem from signal processing, which indicates\nthat a high frequency signal requires more samples to reconstruct. We\nempirically show that a high frequency function is more difficult to\napproximate. This suggests a search-control strategy: we should use states from\nhigh frequency regions of the value function to query the model to acquire more\nsamples. We develop a simple strategy to locally measure the frequency of a\nfunction by gradient and hessian norms, and provide theoretical justification\nfor this approach.

DNN has been widely used for\nestimating a time-frequency~(T-F) mask which enhances a speech signal. One\npopular DNN structure for that is a recurrent neural network~(RNN) owing to its\ncapability of effectively modelling time-sequential data like speech. In\nparticular, the long short-term memory (LSTM) is often used to alleviate the\nvanishing/exploding gradient problem which makes the training of an RNN\ndifficult. However, the number of parameters of LSTM is increased as the price\nof mitigating the difficulty of training, which requires more computational\nresources. For real-time speech enhancement, it is preferable to use a smaller\nnetwork without losing the performance.

Here, we focus on the study\nof rotation curves associated with spherically symmetric configurations. The\nvalues for the post-Newtonian parameters, which help us to classify the\ndifferent metric theories of gravity, are tightly constrained mainly by solar\nsystem experiments [47,48]. However, in recent years, metric theories\ncharacterized by screening mechanisms [4,10,22,25] have become popular, due to\nthe fact that they lead to the possibility of modifications in larger scales\nthan the solar system while retaining the success of GR on it, allowing for\nviolations of the constraints of the Post-Newtonian parameters. In such a\ncontext, we consider here two kinds of solutions for field equations: (i)\nVacuum solutions and (ii) in the presence of a politropic distribution of\nmatter. For the case (i) we find that the post-Newtonian corrections do not\nlead to modifications significant enough to be considered an alternative to the\ndark matter hypothesis.

Under such a novel system, the central\nquestion lies in whether the IRS is able to enhance the network throughput as\nexpected, if the channel estimation overhead is taken into account. In this\npaper, we first show that the favorable propagation property for the\nconventional massive MIMO system without IRS, i.e., the channels of arbitrary\ntwo users are orthogonal, no longer holds for the IRS-assisted massive MIMO\nsystem, due to its special channel property that each IRS element reflects the\nsignals from all the users to the BS via the same channel. As a result, the\nmaximal-ratio combining (MRC) receive beamforming strategy leads to strong\ninter-user interference and thus even lower user rates than those of the\nmassive MIMO system without IRS. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel\nstrategy for zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming design at the BS and reflection\ncoefficients design at the IRS to efficiently null the inter-user interference.\nUnder our proposed strategy, it is rigorously shown that even if the channel\nestimation overhead is considered, the IRS-assisted massive MIMO system can\nalways achieve higher throughput compared to its counterpart without IRS,\ndespite the fact that the favorable propagation property no longer holds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 07:41:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 05:37:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 15:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

The other\nvalence ePES, assingned to H 1s, is deeper bound such that the overall profile\nof the wave function is well approximated by a Gaussian of the width comparable\nto the Li-H bond length. However, a small fraction, less than $10^{-3}$, of the\nprobability density amplitude tunnels out from the bound potential with high\nwave number, and spreads over tens of nm's with parts recombining to the\nmolecule due to the laser field oscillation. This minor portion of the\nelectronic wave function is the major origin of the HHG extending up to 50\nharmonic orders. Nonlinear dynamics within the potential well induced by the\nlaser field oscillation also contributes to the HHG up to 30 harmonic orders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 08:13:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

One way of doing so is by using information about\nthe upcoming driving conditions, known as look-ahead information, in order to\ncoast with a gear engaged or to use freewheeling. Controllers using such\ntechniques today mainly exist for vehicles in highway driving. This paper\ntherefore targets how such control can be applied to vehicles with more\nvariations in their velocity, such as distribution vehicles. The driving\nmission of such a vehicle is here formulated as an optimal control problem. The\ncontrol variables are the tractive force, the braking force, and a Boolean\nvariable representing closed or open powertrain. The problem is solved by a\nModel Predictive Controller, which at each iteration solves a Mixed Integer\nQuadratic Program. The fuel consumption is compared for four different control\npolicies: a benchmark following the reference of the driving cycle, look-ahead\ncontrol without freewheeling, freewheeling with the engine idling, and\nfreewheeling with the engine turned off. Simulations on a driving cycle\ntypically used for testing distribution vehicles show the potential of saving\n10%, 16%, and 20\\% respectively for the control policies compared with the\nbenchmark, in all cases without increasing the trip time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 10:09:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

In Quantum multiparameter\nestimation, such trade-offs occur for the precision achievable for different\nparameters characterizing a density matrix: an uncertainty relation emerges\nbetween the achievable variances of the different estimators. This is in\ncontrast to classical multiparameter estimation, where simultaneous optimal\nprecision is attainable in the asymptotic limit. We study trade-off relations\nthat follow from known tight bounds in quantum multiparameter estimation. We\ncompute trade-off curves and surfaces from Cram\\'er--Rao type bounds which\nprovide a compelling graphical representation of the information encoded in\nsuch bounds, and argue that bounds on simultaneously achievable precision in\nquantum multiparameter estimation should be regarded as measurement uncertainty\nrelations. From the state-dependent bounds on the expected cost in parameter\nestimation, we derive a state independent uncertainty relation between the\nparameters of a qubit system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 10:43:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-16"}

As the\nnetwork deepens, the learning ability of network becomes more and more\npowerful. However, most SISR methods based on CNN do not make full use of\nhierarchical feature and the learning ability of network. These features cannot\nbe extracted directly by subsequent layers, so the previous layer hierarchical\ninformation has little impact on the output and performance of subsequent\nlayers relatively poor. To solve above problem, a novel Multi-Level Feature\nFusion network (MLRN) is proposed, which can take full use of global\nintermediate features. We also introduce Feature Skip Fusion Block (FSFblock)\nas basic module. Each block can be extracted directly to the raw multiscale\nfeature and fusion multi-level feature, then learn feature spatial correlation.\nThe correlation among the features of the holistic approach leads to a\ncontinuous global memory of information mechanism. Extensive experiments on\npublic datasets show that the method proposed by MLRN can be implemented, which\nis favorable performance for the most advanced methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 10:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

Recently, a promising approach to\nthis problem has been to embed KG entities as well as the query into a vector\nspace such that entities that answer the query are embedded close to the query.\nHowever, prior work models queries as single points in the vector space, which\nis problematic because a complex query represents a potentially large set of\nits answer entities, but it is unclear how such a set can be represented as a\nsingle point. Furthermore, prior work can only handle queries that use\nconjunctions ($\\wedge$) and existential quantifiers ($\\exists$). Handling\nqueries with logical disjunctions ($\\vee$) remains an open problem. Here we\npropose query2box, an embedding-based framework for reasoning over arbitrary\nqueries with $\\wedge$, $\\vee$, and $\\exists$ operators in massive and\nincomplete KGs. Our main insight is that queries can be embedded as boxes\n(i.e., hyper-rectangles), where a set of points inside the box corresponds to a\nset of answer entities of the query. We show that conjunctions can be naturally\nrepresented as intersections of boxes and also prove a negative result that\nhandling disjunctions would require embedding with dimension proportional to\nthe number of KG entities.

Unlike the power spectrum for which (in the absence of\ninstrumental effects) there is a window clear of smooth-spectrum foregrounds in\nwhich the 21cm power spectrum may be detectable, there is no such \"EoR window\"\nfor the bispectrum. Instead, on smaller scales EoR structure modulates that of\nthe foregrounds (FG) to alter the EoR+FG bispectrum from that of the\nforegrounds in a complex manner. On larger scales the EoR structures are\ncompletely swamped by those of the foregrounds, and the EoR+FG bispectrum is\nentirely dominated by that of the foregrounds. It is therefore unlikely that\nthe bispectrum will be useful in cases where we are observationally restricted\nto using foreground avoidance techniques.

This is also the case for control problems,\nwhere optimal solutions can degrade in quality or even become infeasible. Thus,\nthere is the need to design methods that can handle uncertainty. In this work,\nwe consider nonlinear multi-objective optimal control problems with uncertainty\non the initial conditions, and in particular their incorporation into a\nfeedback loop via model predictive control (MPC). In multi-objective optimal\ncontrol, an optimal compromise between multiple conflicting criteria has to be\nfound. For such problems, not much has been reported in terms of uncertainties.\nTo address this problem class, we design an offline/online framework to compute\nan approximation of efficient control strategies. This approach is closely\nrelated to explicit MPC for nonlinear systems, where the potentially expensive\noptimization problem is solved in an offline phase in order to enable fast\nsolutions in the online phase. In order to reduce the numerical cost of the\noffline phase, we exploit symmetries in the control problems. Furthermore, in\norder to ensure optimality of the solutions, we include an additional online\noptimization step, which is considerably cheaper than the original\nmulti-objective optimization problem. We test our framework on a car\nmaneuvering problem where safety and speed are the objectives. The\nmulti-objective framework allows for online adaptations of the desired\nobjective. Alternatively, an automatic scalarizing procedure yields very\nefficient feedback controls. Our results show that the method is capable of\ndesigning driving strategies that deal better with uncertainties in the initial\nconditions, which translates into potentially safer and faster driving\nstrategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 12:53:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

We review the\nlong history the measurement of heat production in nerves and provide a new\nanalysis of these findings focusing on the thermodynamics of adiabatic and\nisentropic processes. We begin by considering adiabatic oscillations in gases,\nwaves in layers, oscillations of springs and the reversible (or irreversible)\ncharging and discharging of capacitors. We then apply these ideas to the heat\nsignature of nerve pulses. Finally, we compare the temperature changes expected\nfrom the Hodgkin-Huxley model and the soliton theory for nerves. We demonstrate\nthat heat production in nerves cannot be explained as an irreversible charging\nand discharging of a membrane capacitor as it is proposed in the Hodgkin-Huxley\nmodel. Instead, we conclude that it is consistent with an adiabatic pulse.\nHowever, if the nerve pulse is adiabatic, completely different physics is\nrequired to explain its features. Membrane processes must then be reversible\nand resemble the oscillation of springs more than resembling \"a burning fuse of\ngunpowder\" (quote A. L. Hodgkin).

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the effects of dichotomization of spatially-referenced continuous\noutcome variables on geostatistical inference. Although this issue has been\nextensively studied in other fields, dichotomization is still a common practice\nin epidemiological studies. Furthermore, the effects of this practice in the\ncontext of prevalence mapping have not been fully understood. Here, we\ndemonstrate how spatial correlation affects the loss of information due to\ndichotomization, how linear geostatistical models can be used to map disease\nprevalence and thus avoid dichotomization, and finally, how dichotomization\naffects our predictive inference on prevalence. To pursue these objectives, we\ndevelop a metric, based on the composite likelihood, which can be used to\nquantify the potential loss of information after dichotomization without\nrequiring the fitting of Binomial geostatistical models. Through a simulation\nstudy and two applications on disease mapping in Africa, we show that, as\nthresholds used for dichotomization move further away from the mean of the\nunderlying process, the performance of binomial geostatistical models\ndeteriorates substantially. We also find that dichotomization can lead to the\nloss of fine scale features of disease prevalence and increased uncertainty in\nthe parameter estimates, especially in the presence of a large noise to signal\nratio. These findings strongly support the conclusions from previous studies\nthat dichotomization should be always avoided whenever feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 13:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

In\nhuman society, where the prevalent form of cohabitation is in cities, the\nhighly dynamic and diverse movement of people is fundamental to almost every\naspect of socio-economic life, including social interactions or disease\nspreading, and ultimately is key to the evolution of urban infrastructure,\nproductivity, innovation and technology. However, despite the crucial role of\nthe spatio-temporal structure of movement in cities, the laws that govern the\nvariation of population flows to specific locations have remained elusive. Here\nwe show that behind the apparent complexity of movement a surprisingly simple\nuniversal scaling relation drives the flow of individuals to any specific\nlocation based on both frequency of visitation and distance travelled. We\nderive a first principles argument stating that the number of visiting\nindividuals should decrease as an inverse square of the product of visitation\nfrequency and travel distance; or, equivalently, as a power law with exponent\n$\\approx \\! -$2. Using large-scale data analyses, we demonstrate that\npopulation flows obey this theoretical prediction in virtually all tested areas\nacross the globe, ranging from Europe and America to Asia and Africa,\nregardless of the detailed geographies, cultures or levels of development. The\nrevealed regularity offers unprecedented possibilities for the modelling of\nmobility fluxes at high spatial and temporal resolution, and it places an\nimportant constraint on any theory of movement, spatial organisation and social\ninteraction in cities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 15:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

It will serve as a\nsource for the PRL presenting it's final results, and will be later published\nin a journal, or as a part of the author's PhD thesis. Motivation for the\npresent measurement arises from the recalibration of the D0 flavor-dependent\njet energy corrections. The recalibration was driven by the observation that\nthe corrections for D0 Run IIb differ notably from those of Run IIa. The\nrecalibration analysis was able to show that the Run IIb corrections should\nhave resembled more those of Run IIa. The recalibrated jet energy corrections\nhave an influence on the reconstructed top quarks through the jets that are\nproduced in top quark decays. Hence, a change in the flavor-dependent jet\nenergy corrections implies the need to revise the top mass measurement,\nperformed by D0 in the lepton+jets channel. The D0 top mass average is almost\ncompletely determined by this measurement, and hence it has a direct impact on\nthe top mass world average. A complete revision of the D0 top mass measurement\nis unlikely to occur, and hence this paper demonstrates the resulting top mass\nshift using a lighter methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 15:28:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

Moreover, unlike this previous attack,\nours does not need generic Gr\\\"obner basis algorithms since it only requires to\nsolve a linear system. For a case called overdetermined, this modeling allows\nus to avoid Gr\\\"obner basis computations by going directly to solving a linear\nsystem. For the other case, called underdetermined, we also improve the results\nfrom the previous attack by combining the Ourivski-Johansson modeling together\nwith a new modeling for a generic MinRank instance; the latter modeling allows\nus to refine the analysis of MinRank's complexity given in the paper by Verbel\net al. (PQC19). Finally, since the proposed parameters of ROLLO and RQC are\ncompletely broken by our new attack, we give examples of new parameters for\nROLLO and RQC that make them resistant to our attacks. These new parameters\nshow that these systems remain attractive, with a loss of only about 50\\% in\nterms of key size for ROLLO-I.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 08:06:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 15:23:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 15:41:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 10:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

Hence, the accurate estimation of\nthe residual (e.g. unknown noise) between the observed image and its ideal\nvalue is an important task. To do so, we propose an $\\ell_0$\nregularization-based Fuzzy $C$-Means (FCM) algorithm incorporating a\nmorphological reconstruction operation and a tight wavelet frame transform. To\nachieve a sound trade-off between detail preservation and noise suppression,\nmorphological reconstruction is used to filter an observed image. By combining\nthe observed and filtered images, a weighted sum image is generated. Since a\ntight wavelet frame system has sparse representations of an image, it is\nemployed to decompose the weighted sum image, thus forming its corresponding\nfeature set. Taking it as data for clustering, we present an improved FCM\nalgorithm by imposing an $\\ell_0$ regularization term on the residual between\nthe feature set and its ideal value, which implies that the favorable\nestimation of the residual is obtained and the ideal value participates in\nclustering. Spatial information is also introduced into clustering since it is\nnaturally encountered in image segmentation. Furthermore, it makes the\nestimation of the residual more reliable. To further enhance the segmentation\neffects of the improved FCM algorithm, we also employ the morphological\nreconstruction to smoothen the labels generated by clustering. Finally, based\non the prototypes and smoothed labels, the segmented image is reconstructed by\nusing a tight wavelet frame reconstruction operation. Experimental results\nreported for synthetic, medical, and color images show that the proposed\nalgorithm is effective and efficient, and outperforms other algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 10:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-12"}

Drive-by sensing is a\nform of crowdsensing wherein sensor-equipped vehicles (aka, mobile agents) are\nthe primary data gathering agents. Enhancing the efficacy of drive-by sensing\nposes many challenges, an important one of which is to select non-dedicated\nmobile agents on which a limited number of sensors are to be mounted. This\nproblem, which we refer to as the mobile-agent selection problem, has a\nsignificant impact on the spatio-temporal coverage of the drive-by sensing\nplatforms and the resultant datasets. The challenge here is to achieve maximum\nspatiotemporal coverage while taking the relative importance levels of\ngeographical areas into account. In this paper, we address this problem in the\ncontext of the SCOUTS project, the goal of which is to map and analyze the\nurban heat island phenomenon accurately.\n  Our work makes several major technical contributions. First, we delineate a\nmodel for representing the mobile agents selection problem. This model takes\ninto account the trajectories of the vehicles (public transportation buses in\nour case) and the relative importance of the urban regions, and formulates it\nas an optimization problem. Second, we provide two algorithms that are based\nupon the utility (coverage) values of mobile agents, namely, a hotspot-based\nalgorithm that limits the search space to important sub-regions and a\nutility-aware genetic algorithm that enables the latter algorithm to make\nunbiased selections. Third, we design a highly efficient coverage redundancy\nminimization algorithm that, at each step, chooses the mobile agent, which\nprovides maximal improvement to the spatio-temporal coverage. This paper\nreports a series of experiments on a real-world dataset from Athens, GA, USA,\nto demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 04:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-21"}

A\nwidely used method is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative\nprobabilistic model which models single texts in a collection of texts as\nmixtures of latent topics. The assignments of words to topics rely on initial\nvalues such that generally the outcome of LDA is not fully reproducible. In\naddition, the reassignment via Gibbs Sampling is based on conditional\ndistributions, leading to different results in replicated runs on the same text\ndata. This fact is often neglected in everyday practice. We aim to improve the\nreliability of LDA results. Therefore, we study the stability of LDA by\ncomparing assignments from replicated runs. We propose to quantify the\nsimilarity of two generated topics by a modified Jaccard coefficient. Using\nsuch similarities, topics can be clustered. A new pruning algorithm for\nhierarchical clustering results based on the idea that two LDA runs create\npairs of similar topics is proposed. This approach leads to the new measure\nS-CLOP ({\\bf S}imilarity of multiple sets by {\\bf C}lustering with {\\bf LO}cal\n{\\bf P}runing) for quantifying the stability of LDA models. We discuss some\ncharacteristics of this measure and illustrate it with an application to real\ndata consisting of newspaper articles from \\textit{USA Today}. Our results show\nthat the measure S-CLOP is useful for assessing the stability of LDA models or\nany other topic modeling procedure that characterize its topics by word\ndistributions. Based on the newly proposed measure for LDA stability, we\npropose a method to increase the reliability and hence to improve the\nreproducibility of empirical findings based on topic modeling. This increase in\nreliability is obtained by running the LDA several times and taking as\nprototype the most representative run, that is the LDA run with highest average\nsimilarity to all other runs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 07:10:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-02"}
