A central challenge in this approach is that the feature\nextractor quickly learns to exploit low-level visual features such as color\naberrations or watermarks and then fails to learn useful semantic\nrepresentations. Much work has gone into identifying such \"shortcut\" features\nand hand-designing schemes to reduce their effect. Here, we propose a general\nframework for mitigating the effect shortcut features. Our key assumption is\nthat those features which are the first to be exploited for solving the pretext\ntask may also be the most vulnerable to an adversary trained to make the task\nharder. We show that this assumption holds across common pretext tasks and\ndatasets by training a \"lens\" network to make small image changes that\nmaximally reduce performance in the pretext task. Representations learned with\nthe modified images outperform those learned without in all tested cases.\nAdditionally, the modifications made by the lens reveal how the choice of\npretext task and dataset affects the features learned by self-supervision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 16:00:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 17:31:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 11:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

An incoherent-to-coherent crossover due to the Hund's coupling\ninduced electronic correlation is revealed below the crossover temperature\n$T^*\\sim 75\\pm15\\,\\mathrm{K}$. During the electronic crossover, both the Knight\nshift ($K$) and the bulk magnetic susceptibility ($\\chi$) exhibit a similar\nnonmonotonic temperature dependence, and a so-called Knight shift anomaly is\nalso revealed by a careful $K$-$\\chi$ analysis. Such an electronic crossover\nhas been also observed in heavily hole-doped pnictide superconductors\n\\emph{A}Fe$_2$As$_2$ (\\emph{A} = K, Rb, and Cs), which is ascribed to the\nHund's coupling induced electronic correlation.

The effect of each action is evaluated comparing the\nevolution of the flow with and without the action, gathering statistics over\n1700 repetitions of the experiment for each action. The analysis of the results\nshow that small/short forcings are equally likely to increase or decrease the\nskin friction drag, independently of the sign of the forcing (i.e., towards or\naway from the wall). When the size or the duration of the forcing increases, so\ndoes the probability of increasing the skin friction. Then, an \"a priori\"\nanalysis is performed, evaluating the state of the flow just before the action,\nconditioned to actions that result in a decrease of the skin friction over a\nperiod of one eddy turn-over time. The resulting fields of velocity, wall shear\nstresses and wall pressure are consistent with an opposition control strategy,\nwhere the forcing is opposing the vertical motions near the wall. Finally, a\npreliminary analysis of the performance of actuation triggered by pressure or\nwall shear stresses sensors is evaluated (i.e., \"a posteriori\" analysis).

In this paper, we argue for examining adversarial\nexamples from the perspective of Bayes-Optimal classification. We construct\nrealistic image datasets for which the Bayes-Optimal classifier can be\nefficiently computed and derive analytic conditions on the distributions under\nwhich these classifiers are provably robust against any adversarial attack even\nin high dimensions. Our results show that even when these \"gold standard\"\noptimal classifiers are robust, CNNs trained on the same datasets consistently\nlearn a vulnerable classifier, indicating that adversarial examples are often\nan avoidable \"bug\". We further show that RBF SVMs trained on the same data\nconsistently learn a robust classifier.

However, as an indirect motion, skyrmion ratchet motion speed is\ngenerally low in comparison with the direct motions driven by current. Toward\npractical applications, it is important to ask if there are mechanisms to\nrealize ultrafast ratchet motion of magnetic skyrmions and how such novel\nmotion can be integrated into racetrack-type skyrmion devices. In this work, we\nexplore the effects of defects and edges on the ratchet motion of magnetic\nskyrmions under time-varying magnetic fields in GHz. We demonstrate that the\nratchet motion of skyrmion is not only guided along the defect tracks or edges,\nbut also with a remarkable speed-up (with a factor over ten) compared with that\nin the bulk region. The skyrmion ratchet motion speed reaches 100 m/s along a\nstraight defect track/edge and 10^9 rad/s along a circular edge under a field\nof ~50 mT, comparable to those direct motions driven by currents. Moreover, the\nskyrmion ratchet motion along the defect track/edge can be facilely controlled\nby the field and defect parameters. Analysis based on time-averaged Thiele\nequation of skyrmion verifies that such a speed-up effect is due to the\nincreased time-averaged driving force perpendicular to the skyrmion motion when\nit approaches the defect track or edge, analogous to that discovered in direct\nmotions driven by currents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 17:03:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 14:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-27"}

We show that it is\npossible to focus notions of language similarity into a small number of lens\nparameters given a core universal matrix representation.

In designing a\ncompression method, one aims to communicate as few bits as possible, which\nminimizes the cost per communication round, while at the same time attempting\nto impart as little distortion (variance) to the communicated messages as\npossible, which minimizes the adverse effect of the compression on the overall\nnumber of communication rounds. However, intuitively, these two goals are\nfundamentally in conflict: the more compression we allow, the more distorted\nthe messages become. We formalize this intuition and prove an {\\em uncertainty\nprinciple} for randomized compression operators, thus quantifying this\nlimitation mathematically, and {\\em effectively providing asymptotically tight\nlower bounds on what might be achievable with communication compression}.\nMotivated by these developments, we call for the search for the optimal\ncompression operator.

For example, in the case of Gaussian\nperturbation,\n  \\emph{MaxUp} is asymptotically equivalent to using the gradient norm of the\nloss as a penalty to encourage smoothness. We test \\emph{MaxUp} on a range of\ntasks, including image classification, language modeling, and adversarial\ncertification, on which \\emph{MaxUp} consistently outperforms the existing best\nbaseline methods, without introducing substantial computational overhead. In\nparticular, we improve ImageNet classification from the state-of-the-art top-1\naccuracy $85.5\\%$ without extra data to $85.8\\%$.

However,\nas the first step, the feature point matching between aerial and ground images\nis remarkably difficult, due to the large differences in viewpoint and\nillumination conditions. Previous studies based on geometry-aware image\nrectification have alleviated this problem, but the performance and convenience\nof this strategy is limited by several flaws, e.g. quadratic image pairs,\nsegregated extraction of descriptors and occlusions. To address these problems,\nwe propose a novel approach: leveraging photogrammetric mesh models for\naerial-ground image matching. The methods of this proposed approach have linear\ntime complexity with regard to the number of images, can explicitly handle low\noverlap using multi-view images and can be directly injected into off-the-shelf\nstructure-from-motion (SfM) and multi-view stereo (MVS) solutions. First,\naerial and ground images are reconstructed separately and initially\nco-registered through weak georeferencing data. Second, aerial models are\nrendered to the initial ground views, in which the color, depth and normal\nimages are obtained. Then, the synthesized color images and the corresponding\nground images are matched by comparing the descriptors, filtered by local\ngeometrical information, and then propagated to the aerial views using depth\nimages and patch-based matching. Experimental evaluations using various\ndatasets confirm the superior performance of the proposed methods in\naerial-ground image matching. In addition, incorporation of the existing SfM\nand MVS solutions into these methods enables more complete and accurate models\nto be directly obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 01:47:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 07:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

In particular, we consider scenarios where one file\nincludes covariates and the treatment measured on one set of individuals, and a\nsecond file includes responses measured on another, partially overlapping set\nof individuals. In the absence of error free direct identifiers like social\nsecurity numbers, straightforward merging of separate files is not feasible, so\nthat records must be linked using error-prone variables such as names, birth\ndates, and demographic characteristics. Typical practice in such situations\ngenerally follows a two-stage procedure: first link the two files using a\nprobabilistic linkage technique, then make causal inferences with the linked\ndataset. This does not propagate uncertainty due to imperfect linkages to the\ncausal inference, nor does it leverage relationships among the study variables\nto improve the quality of the linkages.

Such issues raise the question of the existence of Nash\nequilibrium solutions in the GAN zero-sum game.

Different from\ntraditional 2D images and videos, omnidirectional contents can provide\nconsumers with freely changeable viewports and a larger field of view covering\nthe $360^{\\circ}\\times180^{\\circ}$ spherical surface, which makes the objective\nquality assessment of omnidirectional images more challenging. In this paper,\nmotivated by the characteristics of the human vision system (HVS) and the\nviewing process of omnidirectional contents, we propose a novel Viewport\noriented Graph Convolution Network (VGCN) for blind omnidirectional image\nquality assessment (IQA). Generally, observers tend to give the subjective\nrating of a 360-degree image after passing and aggregating different viewports\ninformation when browsing the spherical scenery. Therefore, in order to model\nthe mutual dependency of viewports in the omnidirectional image, we build a\nspatial viewport graph. Specifically, the graph nodes are first defined with\nselected viewports with higher probabilities to be seen, which is inspired by\nthe HVS that human beings are more sensitive to structural information. Then,\nthese nodes are connected by spatial relations to capture interactions among\nthem. Finally, reasoning on the proposed graph is performed via graph\nconvolutional networks. Moreover, we simultaneously obtain global quality using\nthe entire omnidirectional image without viewport sampling to boost the\nperformance according to the viewing experience. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art full-reference\nand no-reference IQA metrics on two public omnidirectional IQA databases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 05:54:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 07:41:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-24"}

Its Bayesian variants can derive posterior\ndistributions of user and item embeddings, and are more robust to sparse\nratings. However, the Bayesian methods are restricted by their update rules for\nthe posterior parameters due to the conjugacy of the priors and the likelihood.\nVariational autoencoders (VAE) can address this issue by capturing complex\nmappings between the posterior parameters and the data. However, current\nresearch on VAEs for collaborative filtering only considers the mappings based\non the explicit data information while the implicit embedding information is\noverlooked. In this paper, we first derive evidence lower bounds (ELBO) for\nBayesian MF models from two viewpoints: user-oriented and item-oriented. Based\non the ELBOs, we propose a VAE-based Bayesian MF framework. It leverages not\nonly the data but also the embedding information to approximate the user-item\njoint distribution. As suggested by the ELBOs, the approximation is iterative\nwith cross feedback of user and item embeddings into each other's encoders.\nMore specifically, user embeddings sampled at the previous iteration are fed to\nthe item-side encoders to estimate the posterior parameters for the item\nembeddings at the current iteration, and vice versa. The estimation also\nattends to the cross-fed embeddings to further exploit useful information.

This\npaper therefore proposes Star Pattern Fragments (SPF), an RDF interface\nenabling a better load balancing between server and client by decomposing\nSPARQL queries into star-shaped subqueries, evaluating them on the server side.\nExperiments using synthetic data (WatDiv), as well as real data (DBpedia), show\nthat SPF does not only significantly reduce network traffic, it is also up to\ntwo orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art interfaces under high\nquery load.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 07:59:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 12:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

Nevertheless, it has been shown in\nGarivier et al.

In this paper, we show that a variant of ETC\nalgorithm can actually achieve the asymptotic optimality for multi-armed bandit\nproblems as UCB-type algorithms do and extend it to the batched bandit setting.\nSpecifically, we propose a double explore-then-commit (DETC) algorithm that has\ntwo exploration and exploitation phases and prove that DETC achieves the\nasymptotically optimal regret bound. To our knowledge, DETC is the first\nnon-fully-sequential algorithm that achieves such asymptotic optimality.

Previous works focused on supervised\nprivacy-enhancing solutions that require privacy-sensitive information about\nindividuals and limit their application to the suppression of single and\npre-defined attributes. Consequently, they do not take into account attributes\nthat are not considered in the training. In this work, we present Negative Face\nRecognition (NFR), a novel face recognition approach that enhances the\nsoft-biometric privacy on the template-level by representing face templates in\na complementary (negative) domain. While ordinary templates characterize facial\nproperties of an individual, negative templates describe facial properties that\ndoes not exist for this individual. This suppresses privacy-sensitive\ninformation from stored templates. Experiments are conducted on two publicly\navailable datasets captured under controlled and uncontrolled scenarios on\nthree privacy-sensitive attributes. The experiments demonstrate that our\nproposed approach reaches higher suppression rates than previous work, while\nmaintaining higher recognition performances as well.

Since there is a\ngrowing need to provide decision-makers understandings about the logic of\npredictions of black boxes, we also explored different techniques that provide\ninterpretations for these classifiers. In one of the techniques, we intercepted\nsome hidden layers of these neural networks and used autoencoders in order to\nlearn what is the representation of the input in the hidden layers. In another,\nwe investigated an interpretable model locally around the random forest's\nprediction.\n  Results show learning an interpretable model locally around the model's\nprediction leads to a higher understanding of why the algorithm is making some\ndecision.

Although many researches have been conducted to tackle this issue, few\nof them have considered the impact of bursty URLLC. The bursty characteristic\nof URLLC traffic may significantly increase the difficulty of RAN slicing on\nthe aspect of ensuring a ultra-low packet blocking probability. To reduce the\npacket blocking probability, we re-visit the structure of physical resource\nblocks (PRBs) orchestrated for bursty URLLC traffic in the time-frequency plane\nbased on our theoretical results. Meanwhile, we formulate the problem of\nslicing a RAN enabling coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmissions for\nmulticast eMBB and bursty URLLC service multiplexing as a multi-timescale\noptimization problem. The goal of this problem is to maximize multicast eMBB\nand bursty URLLC slice utilities, subject to physical resource constraints. To\nmitigate this thorny multi-timescale problem, we transform it into multiple\nsingle timescale problems by exploring the fundamental principle of a sample\naverage approximation (SAA) technique. Next, an iterative algorithm with\nprovable performance guarantees is developed to obtain solutions to these\nsingle timescale problems and aggregate the obtained solutions into those of\nthe multi-timescale problem. We also design a prototype for the CoMP-enabled\nRAN slicing system incorporating with multicast eMBB and bursty URLLC traffic\nand compare the proposed iterative algorithm with the state-of-the-art\nalgorithm to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 09:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-24"}

Our framework adopts the concept of the Faster R-CNN and uses\na modified Resnet-50 as backbone network and a Feature Pyramid Network to\nextract features from images of different astronomical targets. To increase the\ngeneralization ability of our framework, we use both simulated and real\nobservation images to train the neural network. After training, the neural\nnetwork could detect and classify astronomical targets automatically. We test\nthe performance of our framework with simulated data and find that our\nframework has almost the same detection ability as that of the traditional\nmethod for bright and isolated sources and our framework has 2 times better\ndetection ability for dim targets, albeit all celestial objects detected by the\ntraditional method can be classified correctly. We also use our framework to\nprocess real observation data and find that our framework can improve 25 %\ndetection ability than that of the traditional method when the threshold of our\nframework is 0.6.

The energy eigenstates are found by\nstochastic minimization of the variational function for the energy eigenstates\nwhich allows direct optimization of particular energy state without knowledge\nof the lower energy states. This approach combined with numerous tensor network\nor artificial neural network ansatz wavefunctions then allows further insight\ninto quantum phases and phase transitions in various strongly correlated models\nby considering properties of these systems beyond the ground state properties.\nAlso, the method is in general applicable to any dimension and has no sign\ninstability. An example that we consider is the square lattice J1-J2\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. The model is one of the most studied models\nin frustrated quantum magnetism since it is closely related to the\ndisappearance of the antiferromagnetic order in the high-Tc superconducting\nmaterials and there is still no agreement about the properties of the system in\nthe highly frustrated regime near J2/J1 = 0.5. For J1-J2 model we write the\nvariational ansatz in terms of the two site correlators and in the valence bond\nbasis and calculate lowest energy eigenstates in the highly frustrated regime\nnear J2/J1 = 0.5 where the system has a paramagnetic phase. We find that our\nresults are in good agreement with previously obtained results which confirms\napplicability of the method to study frustrated spin systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 12:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

To take\nadvantage of goal imagination, agents must be able to leverage these\ndescriptions to interpret their imagined out-of-distribution goals.

This\ncoupling manifests itself with different effects in different parts of the\nvortex, as has been shown for the ring surrounding the vortex where the pulse\nenergy is maximum, and also in the immediate vicinity of the vortex center. In\nmay applications, however, the ring of maximum energy is not of primary\ninterest, but that where the pulse peak intensity is maximum, which is\nparticularly true in nonlinear optics applications such as the experiments with\nultrafast vortices exciting high harmonics and attosecond pulses carrying also\nOAM. This article describes the effects of the OAM-temporal coupling at the\nring of maximum pulse peak intensity, which does not always coincide with the\nring of maximum pulse energy.

We\nsuggest a time series model for global horizontal irradiation for which it is\neasy to generate an arbitrary number of scenarios and thus allows for\nmultivariate probabilistic forecasts for arbitrary time horizons. In contrast\nto many simplified models that have been considered in the literature so far it\nfeatures several important stylized facts. Sharp time dependent lower and upper\nbounds of global horizontal irradiations are estimated that improve the often\nused physical bounds. The parameters of the beta distributed marginals of the\ntransformed data are allowed to be time dependent. A copula-based time series\nmodel is introduced for the hourly and daily dependence structure based on a\nsimple graphical structure known from the theory of vine copulas.

We first explore the close-in multi-super earth\nsystems $\\lesssim0.1$ au. They are resistant to flybys in that only ones inside\na few au can destabilise a planet or break the resonance between such planets.\nBut these systems may capture giant planets onto wide orbits from the intruding\nstar during distant flybys. If so, the original close-in small planets' orbits\nmay be tilted together through Kozai--Lidov mechanism, forming a ``cold''\nsystem that is significantly inclined against the equator of the central host.\nMoving to the intermediately-placed planets around solar-like stars, we find\nthat the planets' mass gradient governs the systems' long-term evolution\npost-encounter: more massive planets have better chances to survive. Also, a\nsystem's angular momentum deficit, a quantity describing how eccentric/inclined\nthe orbits are, measured immediately after the encounter, closely relates to\nthe longevity of the systems -- whether or not and when the systems turn\nunstable in the ensuing evolution millions of years post-encounter.

In some cases, the outcome\ncan be observed only on an ordinal or dichotomous scale. Then the success of\ntwo therapies is assessed by comparing the outcome of two randomly selected\npatients from the two therapy groups by 'better', 'equal' or 'worse'. These\noutcomes can be described by the probabilities $p^-=P(X<Y)$, $p_0=P(X=Y)$, and\n$p^+ =P(X~>~Y)$. For a clinician, however, these quantities are less intuitive.\nTherefore, Noether (1987) introduced the quantity $\\lambda=p^+ / p^-$ assuming\ncontinuous distributions. The same quantity was used by Pocock et al. (2012)\nand by Wang and Pocock (2016) also for general non-normal outcomes and has been\ncalled 'win-ratio' $\\lambda_{WR}$. Unlike Noether (1987), Wang and Pocock\n(2016) explicitly allowed for ties in the data. It is the aim of this\nmanuscript to investigate the properties of $\\lambda_{WR}$ in case of ties. It\nturns out that it has the strange property of becoming larger if the data are\nobserved less accurately, i.e. include more ties. Thus, in case of ties, the\nwin-ratio looses its appealing property to describe and quantify an intuitive\nand well interpretable treatment effect. Therefore, a slight modification of\n$\\lambda_{WR} = \\theta / (1-\\theta)$ is suggested, namely the so-called\n'success-odds' where $\\theta=p^+ + \\frac12 p_0$ is called a success of a\ntherapy if $\\theta>\\frac12$. In the case of no ties, $\\lambda_{SO}$ is\nidentical to $\\lambda_{WR}$. A test for the hypothesis $\\lambda_{SO}=1$ and\nrange preserving confidence intervals for $\\lambda_{SO}$ are derived. By two\ncounterexamples it is demonstrated that generalizations of both the win-ratio\nand the success-odds to more than two treatments or to stratified designs are\nnot straightforward and need more detailed considerations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 13:31:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-24"}

Here, we explore the implementation of a machine learning\nframework based on Bayesian inference, namely an unscented Kalman filter (UKF),\nfor estimation of phase noise and compare it to a standard reference method.\nExperimental results obtained over a 20 km fibre-optic link indicate that the\nUKF can ensure very low excess noise even at low pilot powers. The measurements\nexhibited low variance and high stability in excess noise over a wide range of\npilot signal to noise ratios. This may enable CV-QKD systems with low\nimplementation complexity which can seamlessly work on diverse transmission\nlines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 14:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}

The algorithm enhances exploration of the state space in the\npresence of metastability by allowing larger proposal moves at the macroscopic\nlevel, on which a conditional accept-reject procedure is applied. Only when the\nmacroscopic proposal is accepted, the full microscopic state is reconstructed\nfrom the newly sampled reaction coordinate value and is subjected to a second\naccept/reject procedure. The computational gain stems from the fact that most\nproposals are rejected at the macroscopic level, at low computational cost,\nwhile microscopic states, once reconstructed, are almost always accepted. We\nanalytically show convergence and discuss the rate of convergence of the\nproposed algorithm, and numerically illustrate its efficiency on a number of\nstandard molecular test cases.

Once a NK or T cell has identified a\ntarget cell, they form a tight contact zone, the immunological synapse (IS).\nOne then observes repolarization of the cell involving the rotation of the\nmicrotubule (MT) cytoskeleton and a movement of the microtubule organizing\ncenter (MTOC) to a position that is just underneath the plasma membrane at the\nIS. Concomitantly a massive relocation of organelles attached to MTs is\nobserved, including the Golgi apparatus, lytic granules and mitochondria. Since\nthe mechanism of this relocation is still elusive we devise a theoretical model\nfor the molecular motor driven motion of the MT cytoskeleton confined between\nmembrane and nucleus. We analyze scenarios currently discussed in the\nliterature, the cortical sliding and the capture-shrinkage mechanisms, and\ncompare quantitative predictions about the spatio-temporal evolution of MTOC\nposition and MT cytoskeleton morphology with experiments. The model predicts\nthe experimentally observed biphasic nature of the process due to an interplay\nbetween MT cytoskeleton geometry and motor forces and confirms the dominance of\nthe capture-shrinkage over the cortical sliding mechanism when MTOC and IS are\ninitially diametrically opposed. We also find that the two mechanisms act\nsynergistically, reducing the resources necessary for repositioning. The\nlocalization of dyneins in the pSMAC facilitates their interaction with the\nMTs. Our model also opens a way to infer details of the dynein distribution\nfrom the experimentally observed features of the MT cytoskeleton dynamics. In a\nsubsequent publication, we will address the issue of general initial\nconfigurations and situations in which the T cell established two immunological\nsynapses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 14:26:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

QRAMs have to be fast, resource efficient and\nfault-tolerant. The latter is often influenced by access speeds, because\nshorter times introduce less exposure of the stored information to noise. The\ntotal execution time of an algorithm depends on the QRAM access time which\nincludes: 1) address translation time, and 2) effective query time. The bucket\nbrigade QRAMs were proposed to achieve faster addressing at the cost of\nexponentially many ancillae. We illustrate a systematic method to significantly\nreduce the effective query time by using Clifford+T gate parallelism. The\nmethod does not introduce any ancillae qubits.

Existing\nserverless platforms isolate functions in ephemeral, stateless containers,\npreventing them from directly sharing memory. This forces users to duplicate\nand serialise data repeatedly, adding unnecessary performance and resource\ncosts. We believe that a new lightweight isolation approach is needed, which\nsupports sharing memory directly between functions and reduces resource\noverheads.\n  We introduce Faaslets, a new isolation abstraction for high-performance\nserverless computing. Faaslets isolate the memory of executed functions using\nsoftware-fault isolation (SFI), as provided by WebAssembly, while allowing\nmemory regions to be shared between functions in the same address space.\nFaaslets can thus avoid expensive data movement when functions are co-located\non the same machine. Our runtime for Faaslets, Faasm, isolates other resources,\ne.g. CPU and network, using standard Linux cgroups, and provides a low-level\nPOSIX host interface for networking, file system access and dynamic loading. To\nreduce initialisation times, Faasm restores Faaslets from already-initialised\nsnapshots. We compare Faasm to a standard container-based platform and show\nthat, when training a machine learning model, it achieves a 2x speed-up with\n10x less memory; for serving machine learning inference, Faasm doubles the\nthroughput and reduces tail latency by 90%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 15:07:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 13:58:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-22"}

Since a link between the accretion properties and the power of the\nproduced jets is expected both from theory and observations, their nature is\nstill debated.

The low accretion rate estimates for FRII-LERGs, from both X-ray and\noptical bands, allow us to firmly reject the hypothesis for that they are the\nhighly obscured counterpart of powerful FRII-HERGs/BLRGs. Therefore, at least\ntwo hypothesis can be invoked to explain the FRII-LERGs nature: (i) they are\nevolving from classical FRIIs because of the depletion of accreting cold gas in\nthe nuclear region, while the extended radio emission is the heritage of a past\nefficiently accreting activity; (ii) they are an intrinsically distinct class\nof objects with respect to classical FRIs/FRIIs.

To achieve a sound trade-off between the segmentation\nperformance and the speed of clustering, we come up with a Kullback-Leibler\n(KL) divergence-based FCM algorithm by incorporating a tight wavelet frame\ntransform and a morphological reconstruction operation. To enhance FCM's\nrobustness, an observed image is first filtered by using the morphological\nreconstruction. A tight wavelet frame system is employed to decompose the\nobserved and filtered images so as to form their feature sets. Considering\nthese feature sets as data of clustering, an modified FCM algorithm is\nproposed, which introduces a KL divergence term in the partition matrix into\nits objective function. The KL divergence term aims to make membership degrees\nof each image pixel closer to those of its neighbors, which brings that the\nmembership partition becomes more suitable and the parameter setting of FCM\nbecomes simplified. On the basis of the obtained partition matrix and\nprototypes, the segmented feature set is reconstructed by minimizing the\ninverse process of the modified objective function. To modify abnormal features\nproduced in the reconstruction process, each reconstructed feature is\nreassigned to the closest prototype. As a result, the segmentation accuracy of\nKL divergence-based FCM is further improved. What's more, the segmented image\nis reconstructed by using a tight wavelet frame reconstruction operation.\nFinally, supporting experiments coping with synthetic, medical and color images\nare reported. Experimental results exhibit that the proposed algorithm works\nwell and comes with better segmentation performance than other comparative\nalgorithms.

In order to\nquantify the error introduced by using these circuits and avoid the expensive\nhardware prototyping, a software emulator of the DNN accelerator is usually\nexecuted on CPU or GPU. However, this emulation is typically two or three\norders of magnitude slower than a software DNN implementation running on CPU or\nGPU and operating with standard floating point arithmetic instructions and\ncommon DNN libraries. The reason is that there is no hardware support for\napproximate arithmetic operations on common CPUs and GPUs and these operations\nhave to be expensively emulated. In order to address this issue, we propose an\nefficient emulation method for approximate circuits utilized in a given DNN\naccelerator which is emulated on GPU.

In\nsuch techniques, an isocontour of a level set field interpolated from nodal\nlevel set values defines a problem's geometry. If the interface is explicitly\ntracked, the intersected elements are typically divided into sub-elements to\nwhich a phase needs to be assigned. Due to loss of information in the\ndiscretization of the level set field, certain geometrical configurations allow\nfor ambiguous phase assignment of sub-elements, and thus ambiguous definition\nof the interface.

In\nthis paper, we present AutoFoley, a fully-automated deep learning tool that can\nbe used to synthesize a representative audio track for videos. AutoFoley can be\nused in the applications where there is either no corresponding audio file\nassociated with the video or in cases where there is a need to identify\ncritical scenarios and provide a synthesized, reinforced soundtrack. An\nimportant performance criterion of the synthesized soundtrack is to be\ntime-synchronized with the input video, which provides for a realistic and\nbelievable portrayal of the synthesized sound. Unlike existing sound prediction\nand generation architectures, our algorithm is capable of precise recognition\nof actions as well as inter-frame relations in fast moving video clips by\nincorporating an interpolation technique and Temporal Relationship Networks\n(TRN).

However, energy consumption of a MEC network depends on volatile\ntasks that induces risk for energy demand estimations. As an energy supplier, a\nmicrogrid can facilitate seamless energy supply. However, the risk associated\nwith energy supply is also increased due to unpredictable energy generation\nfrom renewable and non-renewable sources. Especially, the risk of energy\nshortfall is involved with uncertainties in both energy consumption and\ngeneration. In this paper, we study a risk-aware energy scheduling problem for\na microgrid-powered MEC network. First, we formulate an optimization problem\nconsidering the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) measurement for both energy\nconsumption and generation, where the objective is to minimize the expected\nresidual of scheduled energy for the MEC networks and we show this problem is\nan NP-hard problem. Second, we analyze our formulated problem using a\nmulti-agent stochastic game that ensures the joint policy Nash equilibrium, and\nshow the convergence of the proposed model. Third, we derive the solution by\napplying a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based asynchronous\nadvantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm with shared neural networks. This method\nmitigates the curse of dimensionality of the state space and chooses the best\npolicy among the agents for the proposed problem. Finally, the experimental\nresults establish a significant performance gain by considering CVaR for high\naccuracy energy scheduling of the proposed model than both the single and\nrandom agent models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 02:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 04:17:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 02:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-07"}
