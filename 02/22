However,\nmodels with more than a handful of parameters still generally remain a\nchallenge for the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) based inference. To\nadvance the possibilities for performing likelihood-free inference in higher\ndimensional parameter spaces, we introduce an extension of the popular Bayesian\noptimisation based approach to approximate discrepancy functions in a\nprobabilistic manner which lends itself to an efficient exploration of the\nparameter space. Our approach achieves computational scalability for higher\ndimensional parameter spaces by using separate acquisition functions and\ndiscrepancies for each parameter. The efficient additive acquisition structure\nis combined with exponentiated loss -likelihood to provide a\nmisspecification-robust characterisation of the marginal posterior distribution\nfor all model parameters. The method successfully performs computationally\nefficient inference in a 100-dimensional space on canonical examples and\ncompares favourably to existing modularised ABC methods.

Theoretical progress in the area of slow\nrelaxation dynamics of liquid and glassy systems and in the area of vibrational\nspectra of glasses and liquids is reviewed. After laying down a generic\nmodelling framework to connect vibration and relaxation, the physics of metal\nalloys is considered where the emergence of power-law exponents has been\nidentified both in the vibrational density of states (VDOS) as well as in\ndensity correlations. Also, theoretical frameworks which connect the VDOS to\nthe relaxation behaviour and mechanical viscoelastic response in metallic\nglasses are reviewed. The same generic interpretative framework is then applied\nto the case of molecular glass formers where the emergence of\nstretched-exponential relaxation in dielectric relaxation can be put in\nquantitative relation with the VDOS by means of memory-function approaches.\nFurther connections between relaxation and vibration are provided by the study\nof phonon linewidths in liquids and glasses, where a natural starting point is\ngiven by hydrodynamic theories. Finally, an agenda of outstanding issues\nincluding the appearance of compressed exponential relaxation in the\nintermediate scattering function of experimental and simulated systems (metal\nalloys, colloidal gels, jammed packings) is presented in light of available (or\nyet to be developed) mathematical models, and compared to non-exponential\nbehaviour measured with macroscopic means such as mechanical\nspectroscopy/rheology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 16:26:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 09:46:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)\nare used to model a priori causal assumptions and inform variable selection\nstrategies for causal questions. Although tools originally designed for\nprediction are finding applications in causal inference, the counterpart has\nremained largely unexplored. The aim of this theoretical and simulation-based\nstudy is to assess the potential benefit of using DAGs in clinical risk\nprediction modeling.\n  Methods and Findings: We explore how incorporating knowledge about the\nunderlying causal structure can provide insights about the transportability of\ndiagnostic clinical risk prediction models to different settings. A\nsingle-predictor model in the causal direction is likely to have better\ntransportability than one in the anticausal direction.

Furthermore, using DAGs to identify Markov Blanket\nvariables may be a useful, efficient strategy to select predictors in clinical\nrisk prediction models if strong knowledge of the underlying causal structure\nexists or can be learned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 17:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

The motion induces changes of aggregate\ngeometry and hence modifies exciton states. Under certain conditions,\nexcitation energy can thus be transported by the aggregate adiabatically,\nfollowing a certain exciton eigenstate. While such transport is always slower\nthan direct migration through dipole-dipole interactions, we show that\ntransport through motion can yield higher transport efficiencies in the\npresence of on-site energy disorder than the static counterpart. For this we\nconsider two simple models of molecular motion: (i) longitudinal vibrations of\nthe monomers along the aggregation direction within their inter-molecular\nbinding potential and (ii) torsional motion of planar monomers in a plane\northogonal to the aggregation direction. The parameters and potential shapes\nused are relevant to dye-molecule aggregates. We employ a quantum-classical\nmethod, in which molecules move through simplified classical molecular\ndynamics, while the excitation transport is treated quantum mechanically using\nSchr\\\"odinger's equation. For both models we find parameter regimes in which\nthe motion enhances excitation transport, however these are more realistic for\nthe torsional scenario, due to the limited motional range in a typical Morse\ntype inter-molecular potential.

Alternatively, robust bounds in Wasserstein\ndistance are often easier to obtain, thanks to a coupling argument. Our work is\nconcerned with the implication of such convergence results, in particular, do\nthey lead to CLTs of the corresponding Markov chains? One indirect and\ntypically non-trivial way is to first convert Wasserstein bounds into total\nvariation bounds. Alternatively, we provide two CLTs that directly depend on\n(sub-geometric) convergence rates in Wasserstein distance. Our CLTs hold for\nLipschitz functions under certain moment conditions. Finally, we apply these\nCLTs to four sets of Markov chain examples including a class of nonlinear\nautoregressive processes, an exponential integrator version of the metropolis\nadjusted Langevin algorithm (EI-MALA), an unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA),\nand a special autoregressive model that generates reducible chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 17:18:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 21:45:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 02:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

We perform\nphase-field simulations of coarsening via each mechanism in a two-phase mixture\nat nominal volume fractions of 50%-50% and 36%-64%, and the simulated\nstructures are characterized in terms of topology (genus density), the\ninterfacial shape distribution, structure factor, and autocorrelations of phase\nand mean curvature. We observe self-similar evolution of morphology and\ntopology and agreement with the expected power laws for dynamic scaling, in\nwhich the characteristic length scale increases over time proportionally to\n$t^{1/4}$ for surface diffusion and $t^{1/3}$ for bulk diffusion. While we\nobserve the expected difference in the coarsening kinetics, we find that\ndifferences in self-similar morphology due to coarsening mechanism are\nrelatively small, although typically they are larger at 36% volume fraction\nthan at 50% volume fraction.

Specifically, we focus on the setting where there exists\na good \\emph{common representation} between source and target, and our goal is\nto understand how much of a sample size reduction is possible. First, we study\nthe setting where this common representation is low-dimensional and provide a\nfast rate of $O\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{C}\\left(\\Phi\\right)}{n_1T} +\n\\frac{k}{n_2}\\right)$; here, $\\Phi$ is the representation function class,\n$\\mathcal{C}\\left(\\Phi\\right)$ is its complexity measure, and $k$ is the\ndimension of the representation. When specialized to linear representation\nfunctions, this rate becomes $O\\left(\\frac{dk}{n_1T} + \\frac{k}{n_2}\\right)$\nwhere $d (\\gg k)$ is the ambient input dimension, which is a substantial\nimprovement over the rate without using representation learning, i.e. over the\nrate of $O\\left(\\frac{d}{n_2}\\right)$.

In\nconventional data-driven frameworks which use machine learning or statistical\nmodels, structural damage diagnosis models are often constructed using\nsupervised learning. The supervised learning requires historical structural\nresponse data and corresponding damage states (i.e., labels) for each building\nto learn the building-specific damage diagnosis model. However, in\npost-earthquake scenarios, historical data with labels are often not available\nfor many buildings in the affected area. This makes it difficult to construct a\ndamage diagnosis model. Further, directly using the historical data from other\nbuildings to construct a damage diagnosis model for the target building would\nlead to inaccurate results. This is because each building has unique physical\nproperties and thus unique data distribution. To this end, we introduce a new\nframework to transfer the model learned from other buildings to diagnose\nstructural damage states in the target building without any labels. This\nframework is based on an adversarial domain adaptation approach that extracts\ndomain-invariant feature representations of data from different buildings. The\nfeature extraction function is trained in an adversarial way, which ensures\nthat the extracted feature distributions are robust to changes in structures\nwhile being predictive of the damage states. With the extracted\ndomain-invariant feature representations, the data distributions become\nconsistent across different buildings.

MMSB assumes that the membership distributions of\nthe nodes are independently drawn from a Dirichlet distribution, which limits\nits capability to model highly correlated graph structures that exist in\nreal-world networks. In this paper, we present a flexible richly structured\nMMSB model, \\textit{Struct-MMSB}, that uses a recently developed statistical\nrelational learning model, hinge-loss Markov random fields (HL-MRFs), as a\nstructured prior to model complex dependencies among node attributes,\nmulti-relational links, and their relationship with mixed-membership\ndistributions.

We\npresent an expectation-maximization based inference algorithm that learns\nlatent variables and parameters iteratively, a scalable stochastic variation of\nthe inference algorithm, and a method to learn the weights of HL-MRF structured\npriors.

Although there are many\nmethods to measure the Frank constants in the nematic phase, little is known\nabout the elastic constants of the chiral version of the nematic, the so-called\ncholesteric liquid crystal, since the helicoidal structure of the cholesteric\nrenders these methods inadequate.

In particular, chiral\nmixtures that contain the flexible dimer 1'',7''-bis(4-cyanobiphenyl-4'-yl)\nheptane (CB7CB) and rod-like molecules such as pentylcyanobiphenyl (5CB) show a\n$K_{33}$ value that is 5 times smaller than $K_{33}$ of pure CB7CB or of\nmixtures of CB7CB with chiral dopants. Furthermore, $K_{33}$ in CB11CB doped\nwith a chiral agent is noticeably smaller than $K_{33}$ in a similarly doped\nCB7CB which is explained by the longer flexible link in CB11CB.

This technology consists of hundreds of\nantennas that are capable of sending and receiving simultaneously a huge amount\nof data. One of the main challenges when using this technology is the necessity\nof an efficient decoding framework. The latter must guarantee both a low\ncomplexity and a good signal detection accuracy. The Sphere Decoder (SD)\nalgorithm represents one of the promising decoding algorithms in terms of\ndetection accuracy. However, it is inefficient for dealing with large MIMO\nsystems due to its prohibitive complexity. To overcome this drawback, we\npropose to revisit the sequential SD algorithm and implement several variants\nthat aim at finding appropriate trade-offs between complexity and performance.\nThen, we propose an efficient high-level parallel SD scheme based on the\nmaster/worker paradigm, which permits multiple SD instances to simultaneously\nexplore the search space, while mitigating the overheads from load imbalance.\nThe results of our parallel SD implementation outperform the state-of-the-art\nby more than 5x using similar MIMO configuration systems, and show a\nsuper-linear speedup on multicore platforms. Moreover, this paper presents a\nnew hybrid implementation that combines the strengths of SD and K-best\nalgorithms, i.e., maintaining the detection accuracy of SD, while reducing the\ncomplexity using the K-best way of pruning search space. The hybrid approach\nextends our parallel SD implementation: the master contains the SD search tree,\nand the workers use the K-best algorithm to accelerate its exploration. The\nresulting hybrid approach enhances the diversification gain, and therefore,\nlowers the overall complexity. Our synergistic hybrid approach permits to deal\nwith large MIMO configurations up to 100x100, without sacrificing the accuracy\nand complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 21:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

To combat these adversarial attacks, we developed UnMask, an adversarial\ndetection and defense framework based on robust feature alignment. The core\nidea behind UnMask is to protect these models by verifying that an image's\npredicted class (\"bird\") contains the expected robust features (e.g., beak,\nwings, eyes). For example, if an image is classified as \"bird\", but the\nextracted features are wheel, saddle and frame, the model may be under attack.\nUnMask detects such attacks and defends the model by rectifying the\nmisclassification, re-classifying the image based on its robust features. Our\nextensive evaluation shows that UnMask (1) detects up to 96.75% of attacks, and\n(2) defends the model by correctly classifying up to 93% of adversarial images\nproduced by the current strongest attack, Projected Gradient Descent, in the\ngray-box setting. UnMask provides significantly better protection than\nadversarial training across 8 attack vectors, averaging 31.18% higher accuracy.\nWe open source the code repository and data with this paper:\nhttps://github.com/safreita1/unmask.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 23:20:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 20:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

In some multivariate contexts, it is a forecast of a level set that is\nneeded, such as a density level set for anomaly detection or the level set of\nthe cumulative distribution as a measure of risk. This motivates consideration\nof scoring functions for such level sets. For univariate distributions, it is\nwell-established that the continuous ranked probability score can be expressed\nas the integral over a quantile score. We show that, in a similar way, scoring\nrules for multivariate distributions can be decomposed to obtain scoring\nfunctions for level sets. Using this, we present scoring functions for\ndifferent types of level set, including density level sets and level sets for\ncumulative distributions.

Generally speaking, the raw\nsignal can be transformed into various representations (such as Short Time\nFourier Transform and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), and information\nimplied in different representations can be complementary. Ensembling the\nmodels trained on different representations can greatly boost the\nclassification performance, however, making inference using a large number of\nmodels is cumbersome and computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel end-to-end collaborative learning framework for the audio classification\ntask.

Consequently, the\nperformance of each model can be significantly promoted without increasing the\ncomputational overhead in the inference stage.

So far, most of the past works concentrate\non selecting or generating one pertinent and fluent response according to\ncurrent query and its context. These models work on a one-to-one environment,\nmaking one response to one utterance each round. However, in real human-human\nconversations, human often sequentially sends several short messages for\nreadability instead of a long message in one turn. Thus messages will not end\nwith an explicit ending signal, which is crucial for agents to decide when to\nreply. So the first step for an intelligent dialogue agent is not replying but\ndeciding if it should reply at the moment.

The problem is cast as a\nsemi-Markov decision process, and it is shown that the policy exhibits a\ntwo-scale structure, which can be efficiently optimized: in the outer decision,\nupon starting a communication phase, and given its current radius, the UAV\nselects a target end radius position so as to optimally balance a trade-off\nbetween average long-term communication delay and power consumption; in the\ninner decision, the UAV selects its trajectory between the start radius and the\nselected end radius, so as to greedily minimize the delay and energy\nconsumption to serve the current request. Numerical evaluations show that,\nduring waiting phases, the UAV circles at some optimal radius at the most\nenergy efficient speed, until a new request is received. Lastly, the expected\naverage communication delay and power consumption of the optimal policy is\ncompared to that of several heuristics, demonstrating a reduction in latency by\nover 50% and 20%, respectively, compared to static and mobile heuristic\nschemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2020 04:09:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 03:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-02"}

With an aim to clarify this issue,\nwe spectroscopically determined the atmospheric parameters of 148 G-K dwarfs\n(Hyades cluster stars and field stars) by assuming the classical Fe I/Fe II\nionization equilibrium as usual, and determined their oxygen abundances by\napplying the non-LTE spectrum fitting analysis to O I 7771-5 lines.

Likewise, the oxygen abundances of Hyades stars are\naround [O/H]~+0.2dex (consistent with the metallicity of this cluster) without\nexhibiting any systematic Teff-dependence. Accordingly, we conclude that\nparameters can be spectroscopically evaluated to a sufficient precision in the\nconventional manner (based on the Saha-Boltzmann equation for Fe I/Fe II) and\noxygen abundances can be reliably determined from the O I 7771-5 triplet for K\ndwarfs as far as stars of Teff>~4500K are concerned.

In this paper, we aim to find out the factors that\ninfluence the generalization ability of a common copy-mechanism model for DST.\nOur key observations include: 1) the copy-mechanism tends to memorize values\nrather than infer them from contexts, which is the primary reason for\nunsatisfactory generalization performance; 2) greater diversity of slot values\nin the training set increase the performance on unseen values but slightly\ndecrease the performance on seen values. Moreover, we propose a simple but\neffective algorithm of data augmentation to train copy-mechanism models, which\naugments the input dataset by copying user utterances and replacing the real\nslot values with randomly generated strings. Users could use two\nhyper-parameters to realize a trade-off between the performances on seen values\nand unseen ones, as well as a trade-off between overall performance and\ncomputational cost. Experimental results on three widely used datasets (WoZ\n2.0, DSTC2, and Multi-WoZ 2.0) show the effectiveness of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2020 05:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

Although\nseveral deep learning (DL) techniques have been recently proposed for the\nautomated extraction (segmentation) and quantification of these morphological\nchanges, the device specific nature and the difficulty in preparing manual\nsegmentations (training data) limit their clinical adoption. With several new\nmanufacturers and next-generation OCT devices entering the market, the\ncomplexity in deploying DL algorithms clinically is only increasing. To address\nthis, we propose a DL based 3D segmentation framework that is easily\ntranslatable across OCT devices in a label-free manner (i.e. without the need\nto manually re-segment data for each device). Specifically, we developed 2 sets\nof DL networks. The first (referred to as the enhancer) was able to enhance OCT\nimage quality from 3 OCT devices, and harmonized image-characteristics across\nthese devices. The second performed 3D segmentation of 6 important ONH tissue\nlayers. We found that the use of the enhancer was critical for our segmentation\nnetwork to achieve device independency. In other words, our 3D segmentation\nnetwork trained on any of 3 devices successfully segmented ONH tissue layers\nfrom the other two devices with high performance (Dice coefficients > 0.92).\nWith such an approach, we could automatically segment images from new OCT\ndevices without ever needing manual segmentation data from such devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2020 05:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

While MTC are required for most physical systems due to\nstability, power and mechanical restrictions, MPC optimization problems with\nMTC are challenging to solve. To efficiently solve such problems, the on-line\nMPC optimization problem is decomposed into a sequence of simpler problems,\nwhich include two nonlinear programs (NLP) and a rounding step, as typically\ndone in mixed-integer optimal control (MIOC). Unlike the classical approach\nthat embeds MTC in a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) with combinatorial\nconstraints in the rounding step, our proposal is to embed the MTC in one of\nthe NLPs using move blocking. Such a formulation can speedup on-line\ncomputations by employing recent move blocking algorithms for NLP problems and\nby using a simple sum-up-rounding (SUR) method for the rounding step. An\nexplicit upper bound of the integer approximation error for the rounding step\nis given. In addition, a combined shrinking and receding horizon strategy is\ndeveloped to satisfy closed-loop MTC.

Therefore, effective ALR should be able to online navigate a light\nsource toward the target pose, which is challenging due to the complexity and\ndiversity of real-world lighting and imaging processes.

That is, if a domain\n\"almost\" satisfies the mean value property, then it must be necessarily close\nto a ball.\n  Here we investigate the nonlocal counterparts of these results.

The most\nchallenging part of predicting crowd flow is to measure the complicated\nspatial-temporal dependencies. A prevalent solution employed in current methods\nis to divide and conquer the spatial and temporal information by various\narchitectures (e.g., CNN/GCN, LSTM). However, this strategy has two\ndisadvantages: (1) the sophisticated dependencies are also divided and\ntherefore partially isolated; (2) the spatial-temporal features are transformed\ninto latent representations when passing through different architectures,\nmaking it hard to interpret the predicted crowd flow. To address these issues,\nwe propose a Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Network (STSAN) with an ST\nencoding gate that calculates the entire spatial-temporal representation with\npositional and time encodings and therefore avoids dividing the dependencies.\nFurthermore, we develop a Multi-aspect attention mechanism that applies scaled\ndot-product attention over spatial-temporal information and measures the\nattention weights that explicitly indicate the dependencies.

Although their locomotion on flat\nsurfaces using planar gaits is inherently stable, when snakes deform their body\nout of plane to traverse complex terrain, maintaining stability becomes a\nchallenge. On trees and desert dunes, snakes grip branches or brace against\ndepressed sand for stability. However, how they stably surmount obstacles like\nboulders too large and smooth to gain such anchor points is less understood.\nSimilarly, snake robots are challenged to stably traverse large, smooth\nobstacles for search and rescue and building inspection. Our recent study\ndiscovered that snakes combine body lateral undulation and cantilevering to\nstably traverse large steps. Here, we developed a snake robot with this gait\nand snake-like anisotropic friction and used it as a physical model to\nunderstand stability principles. The robot traversed steps as high as a third\nof its body length rapidly and stably. However, on higher steps, it was more\nlikely to fail due to more frequent rolling and flipping over, which was absent\nin the snake with a compliant body. Adding body compliance reduced the robot\nroll instability by statistically improving surface contact, without reducing\nspeed. Besides advancing understanding of snake locomotion, our robot achieved\nhigh traversal speed surpassing most previous snake robots and approaching\nsnakes, while maintaining high traversal probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2020 14:37:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 02:52:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 18:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

The SFH was\nderived through colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting of two extremely deep\nHubble Space Telescope CMDs, sampling the centre and one core radius. The\nattained age resolution allowed us to single out a major star formation episode\nat early times, a second strong burst $4.6\\pm0.4$ Gyr ago and recent\nintermittent episodes $\\sim2-0.2$ Gyr ago. Detailed testing with mock stellar\npopulations was used to estimate the duration of the main bursts and study the\noccurrence of low-level star formation between them. The SFHs in both regions\nshow common features, with activity at the same epochs and similar\nage-metallicity relationship. However, clear indications of a spatial gradient\nwere also found, with mean age increasing with radius and star formation\nepisodes being more prolonged in the centre. While some galaxy evolution models\npredict bursty SFHs in dwarf galaxies and thus a secular origin of the observed\nSFH cannot be excluded in Fornax, other evidence points to possible mergers or\ninteractions as the cause of its bursty SFH.

The analysis is involved with\nCW complex bifurcations of flow-invariant Clifford hypertori, where we refer to\nthese toral manifolds by toral CW complexes. We observe from primary to\ntertiary flow-invariant toral CW complex bifurcations for one-parametric\nsystems associated with two most generic cases. In a particular case, a\ntertiary toral CW complex bifurcates from and resides outside a secondary toral\nCW complex. When the parameter varies, the secondary internal toral CW complex\ncollapses with the origin. However, the tertiary external toral CW complex\ncontinues to live even after the secondary internal toral manifold disappears.\nOur analysis starts with a flow-invariant primary cell-decomposition of the\nstate space. Each open cell admits a secondary cell-decomposition via a smooth\nflow-invariant foliation. Each leaf of the foliations is a minimal\nflow-invariant realization of the state space configuration for all Eulerian\nflows with n-tuple Hopf singularities. Permissible leaf-vector field preserving\ntransformations are introduced via a Lie algebra structure for nonlinear vector\nfields on the leaf-manifold. Complete parametric leaf-normal form\nclassification is provided for singular leaf-flows. Leaf-bifurcation analysis\nof leaf-normal forms are performed for three most leaf-generic cases associated\nwith one to three unfolding bifurcation-parameters. Leaf-bifurcation varieties\nare derived. Leaf-bifurcations provides a venue for cell-bifurcation control of\ninvariant toral CW complexes. The results are implemented and verified using\nMaple for practical bifurcation control of such parametric nonlinear\noscillators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 18:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

While\nnot yet fault-tolerant, Quantum computing is an entirely new method of\ncomputation due to its exploitation of quantum phenomena such as superposition\nand entanglement. While current machine learning classifiers like the Support\nVector Machine are seeing gradual improvements in performance, there are still\nsevere limitations on the efficiency and scalability of such algorithms due to\na limited feature space which makes the kernel functions computationally\nexpensive to estimate. By integrating quantum circuits into traditional ML, we\nmay solve this problem through the use of quantum feature space, a technique\nthat improves existing Machine Learning algorithms through the use of\nparallelization and the reduction of the storage space from exponential to\nlinear.

The common strategy\ndealing with such ambiguous labeling information is to disambiguate the\ncandidate label sets. Nonetheless, existing methods ignore the disambiguation\ndifficulty of instances and adopt the single-trend training mechanism. The\nformer would lead to the vulnerability of models to the false positive labels\nand the latter may arouse error accumulation problem. To remedy these two\ndrawbacks, this paper proposes a novel approach termed \"Network Cooperation\nwith Progressive Disambiguation\" (NCPD) for PLL. Specifically, we devise a\nprogressive disambiguation strategy of which the disambiguation operations are\nperformed on simple instances firstly and then gradually on more complicated\nones. Therefore, the negative impacts brought by the false positive labels of\ncomplicated instances can be effectively mitigated as the disambiguation\nability of the model has been strengthened via learning from the simple\ninstances. Moreover, by employing artificial neural networks as the backbone,\nwe utilize a network cooperation mechanism which trains two networks\ncollaboratively by letting them interact with each other. As two networks have\ndifferent disambiguation ability, such interaction is beneficial for both\nnetworks to reduce their respective disambiguation errors, and thus is much\nbetter than the existing algorithms with single-trend training process.\nExtensive experimental results on various benchmark and practical datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our NCPD to other state-of-the-art PLL methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2020 09:50:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-28"}

Deep learning has been shown across many applications to be\nextremely powerful and capable of handling problems that possess great\ncomplexity and difficulty. In this work, we introduce a new layer to deep\nlearning: the fuzzy layer. Traditionally, the network architecture of neural\nnetworks is composed of an input layer, some combination of hidden layers, and\nan output layer. We propose the introduction of fuzzy layers into the deep\nlearning architecture to exploit the powerful aggregation properties expressed\nthrough fuzzy methodologies, such as the Choquet and Sugueno fuzzy integrals.\nTo date, fuzzy approaches taken to deep learning have been through the\napplication of various fusion strategies at the decision level to aggregate\noutputs from state-of-the-art pre-trained models, e.g., AlexNet, VGG16,\nGoogLeNet, Inception-v3, ResNet-18, etc. While these strategies have been shown\nto improve accuracy performance for image classification tasks, none have\nexplored the use of fuzzified intermediate, or hidden, layers.

Actually, many rural communities in Sudan have extremely limited access\nto diabetic diet centers. People travel long distances to clinics or medical\nfacilities, and there is a shortage of medical experts in most of these\nfacilities. This results in slow service, and patients end up waiting long\nhours without receiving any attention. Hence diabetic diet expert systems can\nplay a significant role in such cases where medical experts are not readily\navailable. This paper presents the design and implementation of an intelligent\nmedical expert system for diabetes diet that intended to be used in Sudan. The\ndevelopment of the proposed expert system went through a number of stages such\nproblem and need identification, requirements analysis, knowledge acquisition,\nformalization, design and implementation. Visual prolog was used for designing\nthe graphical user interface and the implementation of the system. The proposed\nexpert system is a promising helpful tool that reduces the workload for\nphysicians and provides diabetics with simple and valuable assistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2020 09:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}

These devices rely on the high electromechanical\ncoupling coefficient (kt2~7%), attained by Aluminum Nitride (AlN)\nFilm-Bulk-Acoustic-Resonators (FBARs), to achieve a wideband and low-loss\nfrequency response. As the resonance frequency of FBARs is set by their\nthickness, the integration of multiple FBARs, to form filters, can only be\nattained through the adoption of frequency tuning fabrication steps, such as\nmass loading or trimming. However, as the ability to reliably control these\nsteps significantly decays for thinner FBARs, manufacturing FBARs-based\nfilters, addressing the needs of emerging IoT and 5G high-frequency\napplications, is becoming more and more challenging. Consequently, there is a\nquest for new acoustic resonant components, simultaneously exhibiting high kt2\nand a lithographic frequency tunability. In this work, a novel class of AlN\nresonators is presented. These radio-frequency devices, labelled as\nTwo-Dimensional-Resonant-Rods (2DRRs), exploit, for the first time, the\nunconventional acoustic behavior exhibited by a forest of locally resonant\nrods, built in the body of a profiled AlN layer that is sandwiched between a\nbottom un-patterned metal plate and a top metallic grating. 2DRRs exhibit\nunexplored modal features that make them able to achieve high kt2, a\nsignificant lithographic frequency tunability and a relaxed lithographic\nresolution, while relying on an optimal AlN crystalline orientation. The\noperation of 2DRRs is discussed, in this work, by means of analytical and\nfinite-element (FE) investigations. The measured performance of the first\nfabricated 2DRR, showing a kt2 in excess of 7.4%, are also reported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2020 13:32:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}
