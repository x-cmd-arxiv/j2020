In this work, we propose a systematical framework to\nconstruct Bell inequalities from stabilizers which are maximally violated by\ngeneral stabilizer states, with two observables for each local party. We show\nthat the constructed Bell inequalities can self-test any stabilizer state which\nis essentially device-independent, if and only if these stabilizers can\nuniquely determine the state in a device-dependent manner. This bridges the gap\nbetween device-independent and device-dependent verification methods. Our\nframework can provide plenty of Bell inequalities for self-testing stabilizer\nstates.

Various sources\nare taken as motivation for the incorporation of convective boundary mixing\nduring this phase, from s-process nucleosynthesis to hydrodynamical models. In\nspite of the considerable evidence in favour of the existence of convective\nboundary mixing on the pre-AGB evolution, this mixing is not universally\nincluded in models of TP-AGB stars. The aim of this investigation is to\nascertain the extent of convective boundary mixing, which is compatible with\nobservations when considering full evolutionary models. Additionally, we\ninvestigate a theoretical argument that has been made that momentum-driven\novershooting at the base of the pulse-driven convection zone should be\nnegligible. We show that, while the argument holds,estimations based on the\npicture of turbulent entrainment suggest that mixing is possible at both\nconvective boundaries. We demonstrate that additional mixing at convective\nboundaries during core-burning phases prior to the thermally-pulsing Asymptotic\nGiant Branch has an impact on the later evolution, changing the mass range at\nwhich the third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning occur, and thus also the final\nsurface composition. In addition, an effort has been made to constrain the\nefficiency of convective boundary mixing at the different convective\nboundaries, using observational constraints. Our study suggests a strong\ntension between different constraints that makes it impossible to reproduce all\nobservables simultaneously within the framework of an exponentially decaying\novershooting. This result calls for a reassessment of both the models of\nconvective boundary mixing and the observational constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 16:43:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

An efficient\n$\\it{O(N)}$ parallel finite element algorithm is used, thereby allowing\nsimulations at high concentrations, while a Chebyshev polynomial approximation\nis implemented in order to satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. A\nconcentration-dependent anomalous diffusion is observed for suspended\nparticles. It is found that introducing cylinders in a background of spheres,\ni.e. particles with a simple degree of anisotropy, has a pronounced influence\non the structure and dynamics of the particles. First, increasing the fraction\nof cylinders induces a particle segregation effect, where spheres are pushed\ntowards the wall and cylinders remain near the center of the cavity. This\nsegregation leads to lower mobility for the spheres relative to that\nencountered in a system of pure spheres at the same volume fraction.

As the fluid navigates the tortuous\npore space, elastic stresses build up, causing the flow to become unstable at\nsufficiently large injection rates. However, it is poorly understood how the\nspatial and temporal characteristics of this unstable flow depend on pore space\ngeometry. We elucidate this dependence by systematically varying the spacing\nbetween pore constrictions in a model porous medium. We find that when the pore\nspacing is large, unstable eddies form upstream of each pore, similar to\nobservations of an isolated pore. By contrast, when the pore spacing is\nsufficiently small, the flow exhibits a surprising bistability, stochastically\nswitching between two distinct unstable flow states. We hypothesize that this\nunusual behavior arises from the interplay between flow-induced polymer\nelongation and relaxation of polymers as they are advected through the porous\nmedium. Consistent with this idea, we find that the flow state in a given pore\npersists for long times. Moreover, we find that the flow state is correlated\nbetween neighboring pores; however, these correlations do not persist\nlong-range.

We are able to obtain meaningful results using the cycle, the\ntwo-dimensional lattice, and the complete graph with 16 nodes each, which\nrequire 4-qubit quantum circuits up to depth 100.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 18:15:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 12:48:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 13:10:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

We introduce a notion of\nLexicographic age optimality, or simply lex-age-optimality, to evaluate the\nperformance of multi-class status update policies. In particular, a\nlex-age-optimal scheduling policy first minimizes the Age of Information (AoI)\nmetrics for high-priority streams, and then, within the set of optimal policies\nfor high-priority streams, achieves the minimum AoI metrics for low-priority\nstreams. We propose a new scheduling policy named Preemptive Priority, Maximum\nAge First, Last-Generated, First-Served (PP-MAF-LGFS), and prove that the\nPP-MAF-LGFS scheduling policy is lex-age-optimal.

However, this logic family requires inter-stage inverters to\nensure signal integrity in cascaded logic circuits, and inverters must be used\nto provide each logical input signal in its complementary form. These inverters\nand complementary signals increase the device count and significantly degrade\noverall system efficiency.\n  Dual-gate ambipolar field-effect transistors natively provide a\nsingle-transistor XNOR operation and permit highly-efficient and compact\ncircuits due to their ambipolar capabilities. Similar to PTL, logic circuits\nbased on ambipolar field-effect transistors require complementary signals.\nTherefore, numerous inverters are required, with significant energy and area\ncosts.\n  Ambipolar field-effect transistors are a natural match for PTL, as hybrid\nambipolar-PTL circuits can simultaneously use these inverters to satisfy their\nnecessity in both PTL and ambipolar circuits. We therefore propose a new hybrid\nambipolar-PTL logic family that exploits the compact logic of PTL and the\nambipolar capabilities of ambipolar field-effect transistors.

Following how\nthe grain size distribution evolves is a difficult computing task that is just\nrecently being overtaking.

We\nanalyse how the radial distribution of the small to large grain mass ratio\n(D(S)/D(L)) changes over the whole discs in three galaxies: M 101, NGC 628 and\nM 33. We find good agreement between the observed radial distribution of\nD(S)/D(L) and what is obtained from the SPH simulations of a single galaxy. The\ncentral parts of NGC 628, at high metallicity and with a high molecular gas\nfraction, are mainly affected not only by accretion but also by coagulation of\ndust grains. The centre of M 33, having lower metallicity and lower molecular\ngas fraction, presents an increase of D(S)/D(L), showing that shattering is\nvery effective in creating a large fraction of small grains.

The safety of these agents is dependent on\ntheir ability to predict collisions with other vehicles' future trajectories\nfor replanning and collision avoidance. The information needed to predict\ncollisions can be learned from previously observed vehicle trajectories in a\nspecific environment, generating a traffic model. The learned traffic model can\nthen be incorporated as prior knowledge into any trajectory estimation method\nbeing used in this environment. This work presents a Gaussian process based\nprobabilistic traffic model that is used to quantify vehicle behaviors in an\nintersection. The Gaussian process model provides estimates for the average\nvehicle trajectory, while also capturing the variance between the different\npaths a vehicle may take in the intersection. The method is demonstrated on a\nset of time-series position trajectories. These trajectories are reconstructed\nby removing object recognition errors and missed frames that may occur due to\ndata source processing. To create the intersection traffic model, the\nreconstructed trajectories are clustered based on their source and destination\nlanes. For each cluster, a Gaussian process model is created to capture the\naverage behavior and the variance of the cluster. To show the applicability of\nthe Gaussian model, the test trajectories are classified with only partial\nobservations. Performance is quantified by the number of observations required\nto correctly classify the vehicle trajectory. Both the intersection traffic\nmodeling computations and the classification procedure are timed. These times\nare presented as results and demonstrate that the model can be constructed in a\nreasonable amount of time and the classification procedure can be used for\nonline applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 19:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-07"}

The area of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics\nhas been growing rapidly over the past twenty years. This has been driven by\nthe fact that $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric non-Hermitian systems exhibit real\nenergy eigenvalues and unitary time evolution. Historically, the introduction\nof time into the world of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics has been a\nconceptually difficult problem to address, as it requires the Hamiltonian to\nbecome unobservable. We solve this issue with the introduction of a new\nobservable energy operator and explain why its instigation is a necessary and\nnatural progression in this setting. For the first time, the introduction of\ntime has allowed us to make sense of the parameter regime in which the\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is spontaneously broken. Ordinarily, in the\ntime-independent setting, the energy eigenvalues become complex and the wave\nfunctions are asymptotically unbounded. We demonstrate that in the\ntime-dependent setting this broken symmetry can be mended and analysis on the\nspontaneously broken $\\mathcal{PT}$ regime is indeed possible. We provide many\nexamples of this mending on a wide range of different systems, beginning with a\n$2\\times2$ matrix model and extending to higher dimensional matrix models and\ncoupled harmonic oscillator systems with infinite Hilbert space.

These hierarchical models are commonly used to model\npopulation dynamics, animal movement, and capture-recapture data, and are now\nincreasingly being used to model other ecological processes. SSMs are popular\nbecause they are flexible and they model the natural variation in ecological\nprocesses separately from observation error. Their flexibility allows\necologists to model continuous, count, binary, and categorical data with linear\nor nonlinear processes that evolve in discrete or continuous time. Modeling the\ntwo sources of stochasticity separately allows researchers to differentiate\nbetween biological variation (e.g., in birth processes) and imprecision in the\nsampling methodology, and generally provides better estimates of the ecological\nquantities of interest than if only one source of stochasticity is directly\nmodeled. Since the introduction of SSMs, a broad range of fitting procedures\nhave been proposed. However, the variety and complexity of these procedures can\nlimit the ability of ecologists to formulate and fit their own SSMs. We provide\nthe knowledge for ecologists to create SSMs that are robust to common, and\noften hidden, estimation problems, and the model selection and validation tools\nthat can help them assess how well their models fit their data.

Recent\nmeasurements of the TTVs of TRAPPIST-1 led to an estimate of the masses of the\nplanets, enabling an estimate of their densities. A recent TTV analysis using\ndata obtained in the past two years yields a 34% and 13% increase in mass for\nTRAPPIST-1b and c, respectively. In most studies to date, a Newtonian N-body\nmodel is used to fit the masses of the planets, while sometimes general\nrelativity is accounted for. Using the Posidonius N-body code, we show that in\nthe case of the TRAPPIST-1 system, non-Newtonian effects might be also relevant\nto correctly model the dynamics of the system and the resulting TTVs. In\nparticular, using standard values of the tidal Love number $k_2$ (accounting\nfor the tidal deformation) and the fluid Love number $k_{2f}$ (accounting for\nthe rotational flattening) leads to differences in the TTVs of TRAPPIST-1b and\nc similar to the differences caused by general relativity. We also show that\nrelaxing the values of tidal Love number $k_2$ and the fluid Love number\n$k_{2f}$ can lead to TTVs which differ by as much as a few 10~s on a $3-4$-year\ntimescale, which is a potentially observable level. The high values of the Love\nnumbers needed to reach observable levels for the TTVs could be achieved for\nplanets with a liquid ocean, which, if detected, might then be interpreted as a\nsign that TRAPPIST-1b and TRAPPIST-1c could have a liquid magma ocean. For\nTRAPPIST-1 and similar systems, the models to fit the TTVs should potentially\naccount for general relativity, for the tidal deformation of the planets, for\nthe rotational deformation of the planets and, to a lesser extent, for the\nrotational deformation of the star, which would add up to 7x2+1 = 15 additional\nfree parameters in the case of TRAPPIST-1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 22:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

And how can we quantify the\nmodels' parameters that cannot be measured directly? This paper addresses these\ntwo questions by providing a methodology for estimating the solution; and the\nparameters of linear dynamical systems from incomplete and noisy observations\nof the processes.\n  The proposed procedure builds on the parameter cascading approach, where a\nlinear combination of basis functions approximates the implicitly defined\nsolution of the dynamical system. The systems' parameters are then estimated so\nthat this approximating solution adheres to the data. By taking advantage of\nthe linearity of the system, we have simplified the parameter cascading\nestimation procedure, and by developing a new iterative scheme, we achieve fast\nand stable computation.\n  We illustrate our approach by obtaining a linear differential equation that\nrepresents real data from biomechanics. Comparing our approach with popular\nmethods for estimating the parameters of linear dynamical systems, namely, the\nnon-linear least-squares approach, simulated annealing, parameter cascading and\nsmooth functional tempering reveals a considerable reduction in computation and\nan improved bias and sampling variance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 22:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

The large $N$ limit is\ntaken keeping $gN=\\lambda$ fixed, where $g$ multiplies the quartic Hamiltonian.\nWe introduce a simple model with $O(N)\\times SO(4)$ symmetry, whose energies\nare expressed in terms of the quadratic Casimirs of the symmetry groups. This\nmodel may be deformed so that the symmetry is $O(N)\\times O(2)^2$, and the\nHamiltonian reduces to that studied in arXiv:1802.10263.

Estimating the gaze direction is the most obvious way to\ngauge a driver's state under ideal conditions when limited to using\nnon-intrusive imaging sensors. Unfortunately, the vehicular environment\nintroduces a variety of challenges that are usually unaccounted for - harsh\nillumination, nighttime conditions, and reflective eyeglasses. Relying on head\npose alone under such conditions can prove to be unreliable and erroneous. In\nthis study, we offer solutions to address these problems encountered in the\nreal world. To solve issues with lighting, we demonstrate that using an\ninfrared camera with suitable equalization and normalization suffices. To\nhandle eyeglasses and their corresponding artifacts, we adopt image-to-image\ntranslation using generative adversarial networks to pre-process images prior\nto gaze estimation. Our proposed Gaze Preserving CycleGAN (GPCycleGAN) is\ntrained to preserve the driver's gaze while removing potential eyeglasses from\nface images.

To realize\naccumulative computation under intermittent power on FPGA, this paper proposes\na low-cost design framework, Data-Flow-Tracking FPGA (DFT-FPGA), which utilizes\nbinary counters to track intermediate data flow. Instead of keeping all on-chip\nintermediate data, DFT-FPGA only targets on necessary data that is labeled by\noff-line analysis and identified by an online tracking system. The evaluation\nshows that compared with state-of-the-art techniques, DFT-FPGA can realize\naccumulative computing with less off-line workload and significantly reduce\nonline roll-back time and resource utilization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 04:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-07"}

The task of inspired headline\ngeneration can be viewed as a specific form of Headline Generation (HG) task,\nwith the emphasis on creating an attractive headline from a given news article.\nTo generate inspired headlines, we propose a novel framework called\nPOpularity-Reinforced Learning for inspired Headline Generation (PORL-HG).\nPORL-HG exploits the extractive-abstractive architecture with 1) Popular Topic\nAttention (PTA) for guiding the extractor to select the attractive sentence\nfrom the article and 2) a popularity predictor for guiding the abstractor to\nrewrite the attractive sentence.

Following up on previous work that has demonstrated\nthe effectiveness of Particle Swarm Optimization in reducing the computational\ncost of this search, we present an implementation that achieves near real-time\ncomputational speed. This is achieved by combining the search efficiency of PSO\nwith a significantly revised and optimized numerical implementation of the\nunderlying mathematical formalism along with additional multi-threaded\nparallelization layers in a distributed computing framework.

However, the\npredefined user persona descriptions are usually short and limited to only a\nfew descriptive words, which makes it hard to correlate them with the\ndialogues. As a result, existing methods either fail to use the persona\ndescription or use them improperly when generating persona consistent\nresponses. To address this, we propose a neural topical expansion framework,\nnamely Persona Exploration and Exploitation (PEE), which is able to extend the\npredefined user persona description with semantically correlated content before\nutilizing them to generate dialogue responses. PEE consists of two main\nmodules: persona exploration and persona exploitation. The former learns to\nextend the predefined user persona description by mining and correlating with\nexisting dialogue corpus using a variational auto-encoder (VAE) based topic\nmodel. The latter learns to generate persona consistent responses by utilizing\nthe predefined and extended user persona description. In order to make persona\nexploitation learn to utilize user persona description more properly, we also\nintroduce two persona-oriented loss functions: Persona-oriented Matching\n(P-Match) loss and Persona-oriented Bag-of-Words (P-BoWs) loss which\nrespectively supervise persona selection in encoder and decoder.

However,\nit is uncertain to what extent regression models such as driving models are\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks, the effectiveness of existing defense\ntechniques, and the defense implications for system and middleware builders.\nThis paper presents an in-depth analysis of five adversarial attacks and four\ndefense methods on three driving models. Experiments show that, similar to\nclassification models, these models are still highly vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks. This poses a big security threat to autonomous driving and thus should\nbe taken into account in practice. While these defense methods can effectively\ndefend against different attacks, none of them are able to provide adequate\nprotection against all five attacks.

In this article, we demonstrated the microscopic origin behind such\nmagnetic spin order, hysteresis, polarisation and the so-called magnetic\ncompensation effect in $ACr_2O_4$ ($A$=$Co$, $Mn$,$Fe$, $Ni$) using Monte Carlo\nsimulation. With a careful choice of the exchange interaction, we were able to\nexplain various experimental findings such as magnetization vs. temperature (T)\nbehavior, conical stability, unique magnetic ordering and polarization in a\nrepresentative compound $CoCr_2O_4$ which is the best known multiferroic\ncompound in the $AB_2O_4$ spinel family. We have also studied the effect of\n$Fe$-substitution in $CoCr_2O_4$, with an onset of few exotic phenomena such as\nmagnetic compensation and sign reversible exchange bias effect. These effects\nare investigated using an effective interactions mimicking the effect of\nsubstitution. Two other compounds in this family, $CoMn_2O_4$ and $CoFe_2O_4$,\nare also studied where no conical magnetic order and polarisation was observed,\nas hence provide a distinct contrast. Here all calculations are done using the\npolarisation calculated by the spin-current model. This model has certain\nlimitation and it works quite good for low temperature and low magnetic field.\nBut the model despite its limitation it can reproduce sign reversible exchange\nbias and magnetic compensation like phenomena quite well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 10:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-07"}

During the last several years, a number of\nstudies have revealed that nucleation in the CaSO4-H2O system is non-classical,\nwhere the formation of crystalline phases involves several steps. Based on\nthese recent insights we have formulated a tentative general model for calcium\nsulfate precipitation from solution. This model involves primary species that\nare formed through the assembly of multiple Ca2+ and SO42- ions into\nnanoclusters. These nanoclusters assemble into poorly ordered (i.e. amorphous)\nhydrated aggregates, which in turn undergo ordering into coherent crystalline\nunits. The thermodynamic (meta)stability of any of the three CaSO4 phases is\nregulated by temperature, pressure and ionic strength with gypsum being the\nstable form at low temperatures and low to medium ionic strengths, and\nanhydrite the stable phase at high temperatures and lower temperature at high\nsalinities. Bassanite is metastable across the entire phase diagram but readily\nforms as the primary phase at high ionic strengths across a wide range of\ntemperatures, and can persist up to several months. Although the\nphysicochemical conditions leading to bassanite formation in aqueous systems\nare relatively well established, nanoscale insights into the nucleation\nmechanisms and pathways are still lacking. To fill this gap, and to further\nimprove our general model for calcium sulfate precipitation, we have conducted\nin situ scattering measurements at small- and wide-angles (SAXS/WAXS) and\ncomplemented these with in situ Raman spectroscopic characterization. Based on\nthese experiments we show that the process of formation of bassanite from\naqueous solutions is very similar to the formation of gypsum: it involves the\naggregation of small primary species into larger disordered aggregates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 10:10:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 07:37:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 08:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

The SEDs were fitted with a dust radiative\ntransfer code. Four stars showed a large mid- or far-infrared excess and the\nfitting then included a dust component. These comprise the well-known case of\nRS Pup, and three stars that are (likely) Type-II cepheids (T2Cs), AU Peg, QQ\nPer, and FQ Lac.\n  The remainder of the sample was fitted with a stellar photosphere to derive\nthe best-fitting luminosity and effective temperature. Distance and reddening\nwere taken from the literature. The stars were plotted in a Hertzsprung-Russell\ndiagram and compared to evolutionary tracks for cepheids and theoretical\ninstability strips. For the large majority of stars, the position in the HRD is\nconsistent with the instability strip for a CC or T2C. About 5% of the stars\nare outliers in the sense that they are much hotter or cooler than expected. A\ncomparison to effective temperatures derived from spectroscopy suggests in some\ncases that the photometrically derived temperature is not correct and that this\nis likely linked to an incorrectly adopted reddening.\n  In this work the presence of a small NIR excess, as has been proposed in the\nliterature for a few well-known cepheids, is investigated. Firstly, this was\ndone by using a sample of about a dozen stars for which a mid-infrared spectrum\nis available. Secondly, the SEDs of all stars were fitted with a dust model to\nsee if a statistically significant better fit could be obtained. The results\nwere compared to recent work. Eight new candidates for exhibiting a NIR excess\nare proposed, solely based on the photometric SEDs. Obtaining mid-infrared\nspectra would be needed to confirm this excess. Finally, period-bolometric\nluminosity and period-radius relations are presented for samples of over 370\nfundamental-mode CCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 10:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

The large atomic displacement for Mn ion\nfrom the centerosymmetric position, comparable with the off-centering\ndistortion in the tetragonal ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$, is observed in the\nferroelectric phase ($T_\\mathrm{N}$ $\\leq$ $T$ $\\leq$ $T_\\mathrm{C}$). In stark\ncontrast, in the multiferroic phase ($T$ $\\leq$ $T_\\mathrm{N}$), the atomic\ndisplacement for Mn ion is suppressed, but those for O ions are enlarged. The\natomic displacements in the polar crystal structures are also analyzed in terms\nof the ferroelectric modes. In the ferroelectric phase, the atomic\ndisplacements are decomposed into dominant positive Slater, negative Last, and\nsmall positive Axe modes. The suppression of Slater and Last modes, the sign\nchange of Last mode, and the enlargement of Axe mode are found in the\nmultiferroic phase. The ferroelectric distortion is well reproduced by a\nfirst-principles calculation based on Berry phase method, providing an\nadditional information on competing mechanisms to induce the polarization,\nelectronic $p$-$d$ hybridization vs. magnetic exchange-striction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 11:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

The impact of these large-scale datasets can be\nobserved in almost every vision task and technique in the form of pre-training\nfor initialization. In this work, we propose an easily scalable and\nself-supervised technique that can be used to pre-train any semantic RGB\nsegmentation method. In particular, our pre-training approach makes use of\nautomatically generated labels that can be obtained using depth sensors. These\nlabels, denoted by HN-labels, represent different height and normal patches,\nwhich allow mining of local semantic information that is useful in the task of\nsemantic RGB segmentation. We show how our proposed self-supervised\npre-training with HN-labels can be used to replace ImageNet pre-training, while\nusing 25x less images and without requiring any manual labeling. We pre-train a\nsemantic segmentation network with our HN-labels, which resembles our final\ntask more than pre-training on a less related task, e.g. classification with\nImageNet.

In\nsuch systems, autonomous agents interact locally with their users, and remotely\nwith other agents to make intelligent collective choices. Via these\ninteractions they self-regulate the consumption and production of distributed\nresources. While such complex systems are often deployed and operated using\ncentralized computing infrastructures, the socio-technical nature of these\ndecentralized systems requires new value-sensitive design paradigms; empowering\ntrust, transparency, and alignment with citizens' social values, such as\nprivacy preservation, autonomy, and fairness among citizens' choices.\nCurrently, instruments and tools to study such systems and guide the\nprototyping process from simulation to live deployment are missing, or not\npractical in this distributed socio-technical context. This paper bridges this\ngap by introducing a novel testbed architecture for decentralized\nsocio-technical systems running on IoT.

Further, we extend the procedure to querying the loosely\nguarded fragment.\n  The difficulty in querying a knowledge base of (loosely) guarded clauses is\nthat query clauses are not guarded. We show however there are ways to\nreformulate query clauses into (loosely) guarded clauses either directly via\nthe separation and splitting rules, or via performing inferences using our\ntop-variable inference system combining with a form of dynamic renaming.\nTherefore, the problem of querying the (loosely) guarded fragment can be\nreduced to deciding the (loosely) guarded fragment and possibly irreducible\nquery clauses, i.e., a clause that cannot derive any new conclusion.

We claim our model calculations can explain the diffusion of\ninteracting particles in a fluid. In an ordinary fluid, frequent momentum\ntransfer between particles keeps the particles in a fluid moving together with\ncorrelated time behaviour. The diffusion of interacting particles in a dynamic\nenvironment like this is a nonequilibrium phenomenon and is similar to the\nobserved transient chaotic dynamics in the model. The detailed study of the\nnature of dynamics and synchronization reveals that, for two qualitatively\ndifferent regimes of system parameters, the coupled system passes through an\ninterval of transient chaos before it settles into a chaotic or limit cycle\nattractor. The linear diffusive coupling is equivalent to weak momentum\ntransfer, leading to conventional dynamics and synchronization. The sinusoidal\nnonlinear coupling, harmonic momentum transfer, produces exceptional dynamical\nfeatures. The nature of synchronization is complete(directed motion) when the\nattractor is chaotic or an unstable transient attractor. In contrast, it is\neither lag, anti-lag, or space lag for a limit cycle. In such situations, the\ndiffusion is due to particles pedalling and eddy/swirling motion on top of\ntranslatory motion via transient chaos.

With the goal of avoiding overfitting during training of NNs,\ndropout algorithms consist in practice of multiplying the weight matrices of a\nNN componentwise by independently drawn random matrices with $\\{0, 1 \\}$-valued\nentries during each iteration of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This paper\npresents a probability theoretical proof that for fully-connected NNs with\ndifferentiable, polynomially bounded activation functions, if we project the\nweights onto a compact set when using a dropout algorithm, then the weights of\nthe NN converge to a unique stationary point of a projected system of Ordinary\nDifferential Equations (ODEs). After this general convergence guarantee, we go\non to investigate the convergence rate of dropout. Firstly, we obtain generic\nsample complexity bounds for finding $\\epsilon$-stationary points of smooth\nnonconvex functions using SGD with dropout that explicitly depend on the\ndropout probability. Secondly, we obtain an upper bound on the rate of\nconvergence of Gradient Descent (GD) on the limiting ODEs of dropout algorithms\nfor NNs with the shape of arborescences of arbitrary depth and with linear\nactivation functions. The latter bound shows that for an algorithm such as\nDropout or Dropconnect (Wan et al., 2013), the convergence rate can be impaired\nexponentially by the depth of the arborescence. In contrast, we experimentally\nobserve no such dependence for wide NNs with just a few dropout layers. We also\nprovide a heuristic argument for this observation.

The predominantly used imperative languages\n- like C or OpenCL - force the programmer to intertwine the code describing\nfunctionality and optimizations. This results in a nightmare for portability\nwhich is particularly problematic given the accelerating trend towards\nspecialized hardware devices to further increase efficiency.\n  Many emerging DSLs used in performance demanding domains such as deep\nlearning, automatic differentiation, or image processing attempt to simplify or\neven fully automate the optimization process. Using a high-level - often\nfunctional - language, programmers focus on describing functionality in a\ndeclarative way. In some systems such as Halide or TVM, a separate schedule\nspecifies how the program should be optimized. Unfortunately, these schedules\nare not written in well-defined programming languages. Instead, they are\nimplemented as a set of ad-hoc predefined APIs that the compiler writers have\nexposed.\n  In this paper, we present Elevate: a functional language for describing\noptimization strategies. Elevate follows a tradition of prior systems used in\ndifferent contexts that express optimization strategies as composition of\nrewrites. In contrast to systems with scheduling APIs, in Elevate programmers\nare not restricted to a set of built-in optimizations but define their own\noptimization strategies freely in a composable way. We show how user-defined\noptimization strategies in Elevate enable the effective optimization of\nprograms expressed in a functional data-parallel language demonstrating\ncompetitive performance with Halide and TVM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 14:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-07"}

The use of a GNN and locally-run CNNs results naturally\nin a decentralized controller. We jointly train the CNNs and the GNN so that\neach robot learns to extract messages from the images that are adequate for the\nteam as a whole. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed architecture in the\nproblem of drone flocking and show its promising performance and scalability,\ne.g., achieving successful decentralized flocking for large-sized swarms\nconsisting of up to 75 drones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 15:25:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 14:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

This paper studies\nthe distributed network slicing for a massive scale IoT network supported by 5G\nwith fog computing. Multiple services with various requirements need to be\nsupported by both spectrum resource offered by 5G network and computational\nresourc of the fog computing network. We propose a novel distributed framework\nbased on a new control plane entity, federated-orchestrator , which can\ncoordinate the spectrum and computational resources without requiring any\nexchange of the local data and resource information from BSs. We propose a\ndistributed resource allocation algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method\nof Multipliers with Partial Variable Splitting . We prove DistADMM-PVS\nminimizes the average service response time of the entire network with\nguaranteed worst-case performance for all supported types of services when the\ncoordination between the F-orchestrator and BSs is perfectly synchronized.\nMotivated by the observation that coordination synchronization may result in\nhigh coordination delay that can be intolerable when the network is large in\nscale, we propose a novel asynchronized ADMM algorithm. We prove that AsynADMM\ncan converge to the global optimal solution with improved scalability and\nnegligible coordination delay. We evaluate the performance of our proposed\nframework using two-month of traffic data collected in a in-campus smart\ntransportation system supported by a 5G network. Extensive simulation has been\nconducted for both pedestrian and vehicular-related services during peak and\nnon-peak hours.

Optical coherence\ntomography (OCT) is advantageous in visualizing and quantifying the choroid in\nvivo. (1) The lower boundary of the choroid (choroid-sclera interface) in OCT\nis fuzzy, which makes the automatic segmentation difficult and inaccurate. (2)\nThe visualization of the choroid is hindered by the vessel shadows from the\nsuperficial layers of the inner retina. In this paper, we propose to\nincorporate medical and imaging prior knowledge with deep learning to address\nthese two problems. We propose a biomarker infused global-to-local network for\nthe choroid segmentation. It leverages the choroidal thickness, a primary\nbiomarker in clinic, as a constraint to improve the segmentation accuracy. We\nalso design a global-to-local strategy in the choroid segmentation: a global\nmodule is used to segment all the retinal and choroidal layers simultaneously\nfor suppressing overfitting and providing global structure information, then a\nlocal module is used to refine the segmentation with the biomarker infusion. To\neliminate the retinal vessel shadows, we propose a pipeline that firstly use\nanatomical and OCT imaging knowledge to locate the shadows using their\nprojection on the retinal pigment epithelium layer, then the contents of the\nchoroidal vasculature at the shadow locations are predicted with an\nedge-to-texture generative adversarial inpainting network. The experiments show\nour method outperforms the existing methods on both the segmentation and shadow\nelimination tasks.

Most existing artificial intelligence (AI)\nchips have evolved to rely on new chip technologies rather than on radically\nnew hardware architectures, to maintain their generality. This study proposes a\nnovel, special-purpose, and high-efficiency hardware architecture for\nconvolutional neural networks. The proposed architecture maximizes the\nutilization of multipliers by designing the computational circuit with the same\nstructure as that of the computational flow of the model, rather than mapping\ncomputations to fixed hardware. In addition, a specially designed filter\ncircuit simultaneously provides all the data of the receptive field, using only\none memory read operation during each clock cycle; this allows the computation\ncircuit to operate seamlessly without idle cycles. Our reference system based\non the proposed architecture uses 97% of the peak-multiplication capability in\nactual computations required by the computation model throughout the\ncomputation period. In addition, overhead components are minimized so that the\nproportion of the resources constituting the non-multiplier components is\nsmaller than that constituting the multiplier components, which are\nindispensable for the computational model. The efficiency of the proposed\narchitecture is close to an ideally efficient system that cannot be improved\nfurther in terms of the performance-to-resource ratio.

The online advertising ecosystem nowadays forces publishers\nto integrate ads from these third-party domains. On the one hand, this raises\nseveral privacy and security concerns that are actively studied in recent\nyears. On the other hand, given the ability of today's browsers to load dynamic\nweb pages with complex animations and Javascript, online advertising has also\ntransformed and can have a significant impact on webpage performance. The\nperformance cost of online ads is critical since it eventually impacts user\nsatisfaction as well as their Internet bill and device energy consumption.\n  In this paper, we apply an in-depth and first-of-a-kind performance\nevaluation of web ads. Unlike prior efforts that rely primarily on adblockers,\nwe perform a fine-grained analysis on the web browser's page loading process to\ndemystify the performance cost of web ads. We aim to characterize the cost by\nevery component of an ad, so the publisher, ad syndicate, and advertiser can\nimprove the ad's performance with detailed guidance. For this purpose, we\ndevelop an infrastructure, adPerf, for the Chrome browser that classifies page\nloading workloads into ad-related and main-content at the granularity of\nbrowser activities (such as Javascript and Layout). Our evaluations show that\nonline advertising entails more than 15% of browser page loading workload and\napproximately 88% of that is spent on JavaScript. We also track the sources and\ndelivery chain of web ads and analyze performance considering the origin of the\nad contents. We observe that 2 of the well-known third-party ad domains\ncontribute to 35% of the ads performance cost and surprisingly, top news\nwebsites implicitly include unknown third-party ads which in some cases build\nup to more than 37% of the ads performance cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 02:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-14"}

Even in the 3GPP's 5G architecture, which has a\ncommon Core supporting multiple RATs, radio access related decisions are taken\nindependently within individual RATs. Due to the fragmented nature of\ncontrol-plane in multi-RAT Radio Access Network (RAN), a unified global view of\nnetwork resources is unavailable, hindering optimized allocation of resources.\nIt also brings complexity to the features involving multiple RATs, e.g., dual\nconnectivity.
