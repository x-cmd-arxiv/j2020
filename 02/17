DNNs, however, are known to often make overconfident yet incorrect\npredictions on out-of-distribution samples, which can be a major obstacle to\nreal-world deployments because the training dataset is always limited compared\nto diverse real-world samples. Thus, it is fundamental to provide guarantees of\nrobustness to the distribution shift between training and test time when we\nconstruct DNN models in practice. Moreover, in many cases, the deep learning\nmodels are deployed as black boxes and the performance has been already\noptimized for a training dataset, thus changing the black box itself can lead\nto performance degradation. We here study the robustness to the geometric\ntransformations in a specific condition where the black-box image classifier is\ngiven. We propose an additional learner, \\emph{REinforcement Spatial Transform\nlearner (REST)}, that transforms the warped input data into samples regarded as\nin-distribution by the black-box models. Our work aims to improve the\nrobustness by adding a REST module in front of any black boxes and training\nonly the REST module without retraining the original black box model in an\nend-to-end manner, i.e. we try to convert the real-world data into training\ndistribution which the performance of the black-box model is best suited for.\nWe use a confidence score that is obtained from the black-box model to\ndetermine whether the transformed input is drawn from in-distribution.

It is because\nthere is a considerable gap between a model built with training (seen) data and\nreal (unseen) data in applications. Recent works including Zero-Shot Learning\n(ZSL), have attempted to deal with this problem of overcoming the apparent gap\nthrough transfer learning. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called\nClass Representative Learning Model (CRL), that can be especially effective in\nimage classification influenced by ZSL. In the CRL model, first, the learning\nstep is to build class representatives to represent classes in datasets by\naggregating prominent features extracted from a Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN). Second, the inferencing step in CRL is to match between the class\nrepresentatives and new data. The proposed CRL model demonstrated superior\nperformance compared to the current state-of-the-art research in ZSL and mobile\ndeep learning. The proposed CRL model has been implemented and evaluated in a\nparallel environment, using Apache Spark, for both distributed learning and\nrecognition. An extensive experimental study on the benchmark datasets,\nImageNet-1K, CalTech-101, CalTech-256, CIFAR-100, shows that CRL can build a\nclass distribution model with drastic improvement in learning and recognition\nperformance without sacrificing accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art\nperformances in image classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 17:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

Despite the\nattention cost of frequent task switching, we find that block annotations can\nbe crowdsourced at higher quality compared to full-image annotation with equal\nmonetary cost using existing annotation tools developed for full-image\nannotation. Surprisingly, we find that 50% pixels annotated with blocks allows\nsemantic segmentation to achieve equivalent performance to 100% pixels\nannotated. Furthermore, as little as 12% of pixels annotated allows performance\nas high as 98% of the performance with dense annotation. In weakly-supervised\nsettings, block annotation outperforms existing methods by 3-4% (absolute)\ngiven equivalent annotation time. To recover the necessary global structure for\napplications such as characterizing spatial context and affordance\nrelationships, we propose an effective method to inpaint block-annotated images\nwith high-quality labels without additional human effort.

They are the most\nnotable features of B/PS bulges and appear as four rays protruding from the\ndisk of the host galaxy and distinguishable against the B/PS bulge background.\nIn some works their origin is thought to be connected with the so-called\nbanana-shaped orbits with a vertical resonance 2:1. A star in such an orbit\nperforms two oscillations in the vertical direction per one revolution in the\nbar frame. Several recent studies that analyzed ensembles of orbits arising in\ndifferent $N$-body models do not confirm the dominance of the resonant 2:1\norbits in X-structures. In our work we analyze two $N$-body models and show how\nthe X-structure in our models is gradually assembled from the center to the\nperiphery from orbits with less than 2:1 frequency ratio. The most number of\nsuch orbits is enclosed in a 'farfalle'-shape (Italian pasta) form and turns\nout to be non-periodic. We conclude that the X-structure is only the envelope\nof regions of high density caused by the crossing or folding of different types\nof orbits at their highest points, and does not have a \"backbone\" similar to\nthat of the in-plane bar. Comparing the orbital structure of two different\nnumerical models, we show that the dominance of one or another family of orbits\nwith a certain ratio of the vertical oscillations frequency to the in-plane\nfrequency depends on the parameters of the underlying galaxy and ultimately\ndetermines the morphology of the X-structure and the opening angle of its rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 17:43:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

Nearest-neighbor\ncondensation deals with finding a subset $R \\subseteq P$ such that for every\npoint $p \\in P$, $p$'s nearest-neighbor in $R$ has the same label as $p$. This\nrelates to the concept of coresets, which can be broadly defined as subsets of\nthe set, such that an exact result on the coreset corresponds to an approximate\nresult on the original set.

Without proper care, tests valid for sharp null hypotheses may be\nanti-conservative should only the weak null hold, creating the risk of\nmisinterpretation when randomization tests are deployed in practice. We develop\na general framework for unifying modes of inference for sharp and weak nulls,\nwherein a single procedure simultaneously delivers exact inference for sharp\nnulls and asymptotically valid inference for weak nulls. To do this, we employ\nrandomization tests based upon prepivoted test statistics, wherein a test\nstatistic is first transformed by a suitably constructed cumulative\ndistribution function and its randomization distribution assuming the sharp\nnull is then enumerated. For a large class of commonly employed test\nstatistics, we show that prepivoting may be accomplished by employing the\npush-forward of a sample-based Gaussian measure based upon a suitably\nconstructed covariance estimator. In essence, the approach enumerates the\nrandomization distribution (assuming the sharp null) of a P-value for a\nlarge-sample test known to be valid under the weak null, and uses the resulting\nrandomization distribution to perform inference.

However for goal-oriented interactive tasks, the question of how\nto enhance the perception of specific Crossmodal information, and how\nCrossmodal information integration takes place during interaction is still\nunclear. The present paper reports two experiments investigating these\nquestions. In the first experiment, a cognitive priming technique was\nintroduced as a way to enhance the perception of two Crossmodal stimuli, in two\nconditions respectively, and their effect on sensory-motor performance was\nobserved. Based on the results, the second experiment combined the two\nCrossmodal stimuli in the same interfaces in a way that their correspondence\ncongruency was mutually exclusive. The same priming techniques was applied as a\nmanipulating factor to observe the Crossmodal integration process. Results\nshowed that first, the Crossmodal integration during interaction can be\nenhanced by the priming technique, but the effect varies according to the\ncombination of Crossmodal stimuli and the types of priming material. Moreover,\npeoples subjective evaluations towards priming types were in contradiction with\ntheir objective behavioural data. Second, when two Crossmodal sequences can be\nperceived simultaneously, results suggested different perceptual weights are\npossessed by different participants, and the perceptual enhancement effect was\nobserved only on the dominant one, the pitch-elevation. Furthermore, the\nCrossmodal integration tended to be integrated in a selective manner without\npriming. These results contribute design implications for multisensory feedback\nand mindless computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 20:15:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

Furthermore, our study shows that the emergence of a\n2DES in a given oxide depends on a delicate interplay between its crystal\nstructure and the orbital character of its conduction band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 21:13:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

The\nproblem concerns finding a partition of the data points into $k$ clusters such\nthat the within-cluster variation is minimized. Despite its importance and wide\napplicability, a theoretical understanding of the $k$-means problem has not\nbeen completely satisfactory. Existing algorithms with theoretical performance\nguarantees often rely on sophisticated (sometimes artificial) algorithmic\ntechniques and restricted assumptions on the data. The main challenge lies in\nthe non-convex nature of the problem; in particular, there exist additional\nlocal solutions other than the global optimum. Moreover, the simplest and most\npopular algorithm for $k$-means, namely Lloyd's algorithm, generally converges\nto such spurious local solutions both in theory and in practice.\n  In this paper, we approach the $k$-means problem from a new perspective, by\ninvestigating the structures of these spurious local solutions under a\nprobabilistic generative model with $k$ ground truth clusters. As soon as\n$k=3$, spurious local minima provably exist, even for well-separated and\nbalanced clusters. One such local minimum puts two centers at one true cluster,\nand the third center in the middle of the other two true clusters. For general\n$k$, one local minimum puts multiple centers at a true cluster, and one center\nin the middle of multiple true clusters. Perhaps surprisingly, we prove that\nthis is essentially the only type of spurious local minima under a separation\ncondition. Our results pertain to the $k$-means formulation for mixtures of\nGaussians or bounded distributions. Our theoretical results corroborate\nexisting empirical observations and provide justification for several improved\nalgorithms for $k$-means clustering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 22:15:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 21:19:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

Using this model we quantify hysteresis in terms of\nthe adhesion and elasticity parameters of the system.

However, the online\nfine-tuning process is usually time-consuming, limiting the practical use of\nsuch methods. We propose a directional deep embedding and appearance learning\n(DDEAL) method, which is free of the online fine-tuning process, for fast VOS.\nFirst, a global directional matching module, which can be efficiently\nimplemented by parallel convolutional operations, is proposed to learn a\nsemantic pixel-wise embedding as an internal guidance. Second, an effective\ndirectional appearance model based statistics is proposed to represent the\ntarget and background on a spherical embedding space for VOS. Equipped with the\nglobal directional matching module and the directional appearance model\nlearning module, DDEAL learns static cues from the labeled first frame and\ndynamically updates cues of the subsequent frames for object segmentation. Our\nmethod exhibits state-of-the-art VOS performance without using online\nfine-tuning. Specifically, it achieves a J & F mean score of 74.8% on DAVIS\n2017 dataset and an overall score G of 71.3% on the large-scale YouTube-VOS\ndataset, while retaining a speed of 25 fps with a single NVIDIA TITAN Xp GPU.\nFurthermore, our faster version runs 31 fps with only a little accuracy loss.\nOur code and trained networks are available at\nhttps://github.com/YingjieYin/Directional-Deep-Embedding-and-Appearance-Learning-for-Fast-Video-Object-Segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 01:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

The use of\nRV has led to interest in deciding whether a property is monitorable: whether\nit is always possible for the satisfaction or violation of the property to be\ndetermined after a finite future continuation. However, classical two-valued\nmonitorability suffers from two inherent limitations. First, a property can\nonly be evaluated as monitorable or non-monitorable; no information is\navailable regarding whether only one verdict (satisfaction or violation) can be\ndetected. Second, monitorability is defined at the language-level and does not\ntell us whether satisfaction or violation can be detected starting from the\ncurrent monitor state during system execution.\n  To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new notion of four-valued\nmonitorability for $\\omega$-languages and applies it at the state-level.\nFour-valued monitorability is more informative than two-valued monitorability\nas a property can be evaluated as a four-valued result, denoting that only\nsatisfaction, only violation, or both are active for a monitorable property. We\ncan also compute state-level weak monitorability, i.e., whether satisfaction or\nviolation can be detected starting from a given state in a monitor, which\nenables state-level optimizations of monitoring algorithms.

However, it does not consider the complementarity between the deep\nfeatures and original features during deep feature transformation. Besides, it\nsuffers from small sample problem. In order to solve these problems, a novel\ndeep autoencoder - hybrid feature embedded stacked sparse autoencoder(HESSAE)\nhas been proposed in this paper. HFESAE is capable to learn discriminant deep\nfeatures with the help of embedding original features to filter weak\nhidden-layer outputs during training. For the issue that class representation\nability of abstract information is limited by small sample problem, a feature\nfusion strategy has been designed aiming to combining abstract information\nlearned by HFESAE with original feature and obtain hybrid features for feature\nreduction.

Tremendous computing and storage\nresources can be preserved with a trivial amount of visual information.\nConventional image compression methods tend to obtain compressed images by\nminimizing their appearance discrepancy with the corresponding original images,\nbut pay little attention to their efficacy in downstream perception tasks,\ne.g., image recognition and object detection. Thus, some of compressed images\ncould be recognized with bias. In contrast, this paper aims to produce\ncompressed images by pursuing both appearance and perceptual consistency. Based\non the encoder-decoder framework, we propose using a pre-trained CNN to extract\nfeatures of the original and compressed images, and making them similar. Thus\nthe compressed images are discernible to subsequent tasks, and we name our\nmethod as Discernible Image Compression (DIC). In addition, the maximum mean\ndiscrepancy (MMD) is employed to minimize the difference between feature\ndistributions. The resulting compression network can generate images with high\nimage quality and preserve the consistent perception in the feature domain, so\nthat these images can be well recognized by pre-trained machine learning\nmodels. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that images compressed by using\nthe proposed method can also be well recognized by subsequent visual\nrecognition and detection models. For instance, the mAP value of compressed\nimages by DIC is about 0.6% higher than that of using compressed images by\nconventional methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 07:35:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Aug 2020 13:54:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 00:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

However, the\ntask remains challenging due to many issues. One major issue is related to the\nconfounding factors from the background instrumental music that is mixed with\nthe vocals in music production. A singer identification model may learn to\nextract non-vocal related features from the instrumental part of the songs, if\na singer only sings in certain musical contexts (e.g., genres). The model\ncannot therefore generalize well when the singer sings in unseen contexts. In\nthis paper, we attempt to address this issue. Specifically, we employ\nopen-unmix, an open source tool with state-of-the-art performance in source\nseparation, to separate the vocal and instrumental tracks of music. We then\ninvestigate two means to train a singer identification model: by learning from\nthe separated vocal only, or from an augmented set of data where we\n\"shuffle-and-remix\" the separated vocal tracks and instrumental tracks of\ndifferent songs to artificially make the singers sing in different contexts.

In\nthis paper, we study a hierarchical scenario to include three types of\nparticipants: providers, collectors, and governors. To be specific, providers\nforward transactions, collected from terminals, to collectors; collectors\nupload received transactions to governors after verifying and labeling them;\nand governors validate a part of received labeled transactions, pack valid ones\ninto a block, and append a new block on the ledger. Collectors in the\nhierarchical model play a crucial role in the design: they have connections\nwith both providers and governors, and are responsible for collecting,\nverifying, and uploading transactions. However, collectors are rational and\nsome of them may behave maliciously (not necessarily for their own benefits).\nIn this paper, we introduce a reputation protocol as a measure of the\nreliability of collectors in the permissioned blockchain environment. Its\nobjective is to encourage collectors to behave truthfully and, in addition, to\nreduce the verification cost. The verification cost on provider $p$ is defined\nas the total number of invalid transactions provided by $p$ and checked by\ngovernors. Through theoretical analysis, our protocol with the reputation\nmechanism has a significant improvement in efficiency.

The tensor is defined by regularizing the\ntheory on a lattice, and by fixing its renormalization constants\nnon-perturbatively by suitable Ward identities associated to the Poincare'\ninvariance of the continuum theory. The latter are derived in thermal QCD with\na non-zero imaginary chemical potential formulated in a moving reference frame.\nA renormalization group analysis leads to simple\nrenormalization-group-invariant definitions of the gluonic and fermionic\ncontributions to either the singlet or the non-singlet components of the\ntensor, and therefore of their form factors among physical states. The lattice\ndiscussion focuses on the Wilson discretization of quark fields but the\nstrategy is general. Specific to that case, we also carry out the analysis for\nthe on-shell O(a)-improvement of the energy-momentum tensor. The\nrenormalization and improvement programs profit from the fact that, as shown\nhere, the thermal theory enjoys de-facto automatic O(a)-improvement at finite\ntemperature. The validity of the proposal is scrutinized analytically by a\nstudy to 1-loop order in lattice perturbation theory with shifted and twisted\n(for quarks only) boundary conditions. The latter provides also additional\nuseful insight for a precise non-perturbative calculation of the\nrenormalization constants.

We show that the observed europium abundance in Reticulum\nII is reproduced by our inner explosion model where a NSM is triggered at the\ncentre of the galaxy, whereas the relatively low abundance in Tucana III is\nreproduced if a NSM occurs near the virial radius of the progenitor galaxy. The\nlatter case is realised only if the neutron-star binary has a large natal kick\nvelocity and travels over a long distance of a kilo-parsec before merger. In\nboth the inner and outer explosion cases, it is necessary for the progenitor\ngalaxy to sustain prolonged star formation over a few hundred million years\nafter the NSM, so that the dispersed r-process elements are well mixed within\nthe inter-stellar medium. Short-duration star formation results in inefficient\nmixing, and then a large variation is imprinted in the stellar europium\nabundances, which is inconsistent with the observations of Reticulum II and\nTucana III.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 12:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

The network\nwide QoE maximization problem is decoupled into two subparts. First, a network\nslicing based clustering algorithm is applied to partition the vehicles into\nmultiple logical networks. Secondly, vehicle scheduling and quality selection\nis formulated as a stochastic optimization problem which is solved using the\nLyapunov drift plus penalty method. Numerical results show that the proposed\nalgorithm ensures high video quality experience compared to the baseline.\nSimulation results also show that the proposed technique achieves low latency\nand high-reliability communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 12:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

The pseudotransitions of one-dimensional lattice-statistical\nspin models differ from actual phase transitions in several important aspects:\nthe first-order derivatives of the Gibbs free energy such as entropy or\nmagnetization exhibit near a pseudo-transition an abrupt continuous change\ninstead of a true discontinuity, whereas the second-order derivatives of the\nGibbs free energy such as specific heat or susceptibility display near a\npseudo-transition a vigorous finite peak instead of an actual power-law\ndivergence. In the present chapter we will comprehensively examine a\npseudo-critical behavior of the spin-1/2 Ising diamond and tetrahedral chains\nby a detailed examination of basic magnetothermodynamic quantities such as the\nentropy, specific heat and susceptibility. It will be demonstrated that density\nplots of these magnetothermodynamic quantities provide a useful tool for\nestablishing a finite-temperature diagram, which clearly delimits boundaries\nbetween individual quasi-phases in spite of a lack of true spontaneous\nlong-range order at any nonzero temperature.

Existing sampling\nstrategies for experience replay like uniform sampling or prioritised\nexperience replay do not explicitly try to control the variance of the gradient\nestimates.

Traditional algorithms for\ncomputing rank revealing factorizations, such as the column pivoted QR\nfactorization, or techniques for computing a full singular value decomposition\nof a matrix, are very communication intensive. They are naturally expressed as\na sequence of matrix-vector operations, which become prohibitively expensive\nwhen data is not available in main memory. Randomization allows these methods\nto be reformulated so that large contiguous blocks of the matrix can be\nprocessed in bulk. The paper describes two distinct methods. The first is a\nblocked version of column pivoted Householder QR, organized as a \"left-looking\"\nmethod to minimize the number of write operations (which are more expensive\nthan read operations on a spinning disk drive). The second method results in a\nso called UTV factorization which expresses a matrix $A$ as $A = U T V^*$ where\n$U$ and $V$ are unitary, and $T$ is triangular. This method is organized as an\nalgorithm-by-blocks, in which floating point operations overlap read and write\noperations. The second method incorporates power iterations, and is\nexceptionally good at revealing the numerical rank; it can often be used as a\nsubstitute for a full singular value decomposition. Numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that the new algorithms are almost as fast when processing data\nstored on a hard drive as traditional algorithms are for data stored in main\nmemory. To be precise, the computational time for fully factorizing an $n\\times\nn$ matrix scales as $cn^{3}$, with a scaling constant $c$ that is only\nmarginally larger when the matrix is stored out of core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 13:58:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 12:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-05"}

In that context we also\nshow that the only distance which can be approximately determined is that of\nthe termination shock, if it is a hydrodynamical shock. For MHD shocks the\nstagnation point does not, in general, lie on the inflow line, which is the\nline parallel to the inflow vector and passing through the star. Thus an\nestimate via the Bernoulli equation as in the HD case is, in general, not\npossible. We also show that in O-star astrospheres, distinct regions exist in\nwhich the fast, slow, Alfv\\'enic, and sonic Mach numbers become lower than one,\nimplying sub-slow magnetosonic as well as sub-fast and sub-sonic flows.\nNevertheless, the analytic MHD Rankine Hugoniot relations can be used for\nfurther studies of turbulence and cosmic ray modulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 14:15:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 07:51:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 09:13:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

These methods rely on the law of large numbers\nto estimate expectations via simulation, typically resulting in slow\nconvergence. Their errors usually manifest as undesirable grain in the pictures\ngenerated by image synthesis algorithms. It is well known that these errors\ndiminish when the samples are chosen appropriately. A well known technique for\nreducing error operates by subdividing the integration domain, estimating\nintegrals in each \\emph{stratum} and aggregating these values into a stratified\nsampling estimate. Na\\\"{i}ve methods for stratification, based on a lattice\n(grid) are known to improve the convergence rate of Monte Carlo, but require\nsamples that grow exponentially with the dimensionality of the domain.\n  We propose a simple stratification scheme for $d$ dimensional hypercubes\nusing the kd-tree data structure.

One representative object of the transition from the prestellar core\nto the protostar phases has been observed toward the Very Low Luminosity Object\n(VeLLO) called L1521F. This type of source is important to study to make the\nlink between prestellar cores and Class 0 sources and also to constrain the\nchemical evolution during the process of star formation. Two frequency windows\n(81.6-82.6 GHz and 96.65-97.65 GHz) were used to observe the emission from\nseveral complex organics toward the L1521F VeLLO. Only 2 transitions of\nmethanol (A+, E2) have been detected in the narrow window centered at 96.7 GHz\n(with an upper limit on E1) in a very compact emission blob (~7'' corresponding\nto ~1000au) toward the NE of the L1521F protostar. The CS 2-1 transition is\nalso detected within the WideX bandwidth. Consistently, with what has been\nfound in prestellar cores, the methanol emission appears ~1000au away from the\ndust peak. The location of the methanol blob coincides with one of the\nfilaments previously reported in the literature. The Tex of the gas inferred\nfrom methanol is (10$\\pm$2) K, while the H2 gas density (estimated from the\ndetected CS 2-1 emission and previous CS 5-4 ALMA obs.) is a factor >25 higher\nthan the density in the surrounding environment (n(H2) >10$^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$).\nFrom its compactness, low excitation temperature and high gas density, we\nsuggest that the methanol emission detected with NOEMA is either a cold and\ndense shock-induced blob, recently formed ($\\leq$ few hundred years) by\ninfalling gas or a cold and dense fragment that may have just been formed as a\nresult of the intense gas dynamics found within the L1521F VeLLO system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 15:28:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

In this paper, we employ large-scale Langevin dynamics simulations\nto investigate how the diffusion of a tracer is influenced by the combined\naction of excluded-volume and weak attractive crowder-tracer interactions. We\nconsider two species of tracers, standard hard-core particles described by the\nWeeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) repulsive potential and core-softened (CS)\nparticles, which model, e.g., globular proteins, charged colloids and\nnanoparticles covered by polymeric brushes. These systems are characterized by\nthe presence of two length scales in the interaction and can show water-like\nanomalies in their diffusion, stemming from the inherent competition between\ndifferent length scales. Here we report a comprehensive study of both diffusion\nand structure of these two tracer species in an environment crowded by quenched\nconfigurations of polymers at increasing density. We analyze in detail how the\ntracer-polymer affinity and the system density affect transport as compared to\nthe emergence of specific static spatial correlations. In particular, we find\nthat, while hardly any differences emerge in the diffusion properties of WCA\nand CS particles, the propensity to develop structural order for large crowding\nis strongly frustrated for CS particles. Surprisingly, for large enough\naffinity for the crowding matrix, the diffusion coefficient of WCA tracers\ndisplay a non-monotonic trend as their density is increased when compared to\nthe zero affinity scenario. This water-like anomaly turns out to be even larger\nthan what observed for CS particle and appears to be rooted in a similar\ncompetition between excluded-volume and affinity effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 15:36:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 16:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

Each\nartificial plan was automatically emulated on the 142 CTs, resulting in 42,600\n3D dose distributions from which dose-volume metrics were derived. Anatomical\nfeatures were extracted from digitally reconstructed radiographs simulated from\nthe CTs to resemble historical radiographs. Further, patient and radiotherapy\nplan features typically available from historical treatment records were\ncollected. An evolutionary ML algorithm was then used to link features to\ndose-volume metrics. Besides 5-fold cross-validation, a further evaluation was\ndone on an independent dataset of five CTs each associated with two clinical\nplans. Cross-validation resulted in Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs) $\\leq$0.6 Gy\nfor organs completely inside or outside the field. For organs positioned at the\nedge of the field, MAEs $\\leq$1.7 Gy for D$_{mean}$, $\\leq$2.9 Gy for\nD$_{2cc}$, and $\\leq$13% for V$_{5Gy}$ and V$_{10Gy}$, were obtained, without\nsystematic bias. Similar results were found for the independent dataset. Our\nnovel, ML-based organ dose reconstruction method is not only accurate but also\nefficient, as the setup of a surrogate is no longer needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 04:19:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 17:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

In this article we present a point of view that highlights the\nimportance of finding the upper bounds for prime gaps, in order to solve the\ntwin primes conjecture and the Goldbach conjecture. For this purpose, we\npresent a procedure for the determination of the upper bounds for prime gaps\ndifferent from the most famous and known approaches. The proposed method\nanalyzes the distribution of prime numbers using the set of relative numbers.\nUsing negative numbers too, it becomes intuitive to understand that that the\narrangement of 2P+1 consecutive numbers that goes -P to P, is the only\narrangement that minimizes the distance between two powers having the same\nabsolute value of the base D, with |D|<=P. This arrangement is considered\nimportant because by increasing the number of powers of the prime numbers\nwithin a range of consecutive numbers, it is presumed to decrease the overlap\nbetween the prime numbers considered. Consequently, by reducing these overlaps,\nwe suppose to obtain an arrangement, in which the prime numbers less than and\nequal to P and their multiples occupy the greatest possible number of positions\nwithin a range of 2P+1 consecutive numbers. If this result could be\ndemonstrated, would imply not only the resolution of the Legendre conjecture,\nbut also a step forward in the resolution of the twin primes conjecture and the\nGoldbach conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 15:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

The\ncontent image forms the structure, the basic geometric lines and shapes of the\nresulting image, while the style image sets the color and texture of the\nresult. The word \"arbitrary\" in this context means the absence of any one\npre-learned style. So, for example, convolutional neural networks capable of\ntransferring a new style only after training or retraining on a new amount of\ndata are not con-sidered to solve such a problem, while networks based on the\nattention mech-anism that are capable of performing such a transformation\nwithout retraining - yes.

Current techniques for assessing the impact of lesions\nconsider only location, type, and extent, while ignoring how the affected\nregion was connected to the rest of the brain. Regional brain function is a\nproduct of both local structure and its connectivity. Therefore, obtaining a\nmap of white matter disconnection is a crucial step that could help us predict\nthe behavioral deficits that patients exhibit. In the present work, we\nintroduce a new practical method for computing lesion-based white matter\ndisconnection maps that require only moderate computational resources. We\nachieve this by creating diffusion tractography models of the brains of healthy\nadults and assessing the connectivity between small regions. We then interrupt\nthese connectivity models by projecting patients' lesions into them to compute\npredicted white matter disconnection. A quantified disconnection map can be\ncomputed for an individual patient in approximately 35 seconds using a single\ncore CPU-based computation. In comparison, a similar quantification performed\nwith other tools provided by MRtrix3 takes 5.47 minutes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 01:57:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 02:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-21"}
