Typically, this is achieved by either chemical\nmodification or by controlling the hierarchical structures of surfaces. Here we\nreport a phenomenon whereby the wetting properties of vermiculite laminates are\ncontrolled by the hydrated cations on the surface and in the interlamellar\nspace. We find that by exploiting this mechanism, vermiculite laminates can be\ntuned from superhydrophillic to hydrophobic simply by exchanging the cations;\nhydrophilicity decreases with increasing cation hydration free energy, except\nfor lithium. Lithium, which has a higher hydration free energy than potassium,\nis found to provide a superhydrophilic surface due to its anomalous hydrated\nstructure at the vermiculite surface.

Recent\nwork in MBRL has mostly focused on using more advanced function approximators\nand planning schemes, with little development of the general framework. In this\npaper, we identify a fundamental issue of the standard MBRL framework -- what\nwe call the objective mismatch issue. Objective mismatch arises when one\nobjective is optimized in the hope that a second, often uncorrelated, metric\nwill also be optimized. In the context of MBRL, we characterize the objective\nmismatch between training the forward dynamics model w.r.t.~the likelihood of\nthe one-step ahead prediction, and the overall goal of improving performance on\na downstream control task. For example, this issue can emerge with the\nrealization that dynamics models effective for a specific task do not\nnecessarily need to be globally accurate, and vice versa globally accurate\nmodels might not be sufficiently accurate locally to obtain good control\nperformance on a specific task. In our experiments, we study this objective\nmismatch issue and demonstrate that the likelihood of one-step ahead\npredictions is not always correlated with control performance. This observation\nhighlights a critical limitation in the MBRL framework which will require\nfurther research to be fully understood and addressed. We propose an initial\nmethod to mitigate the mismatch issue by re-weighting dynamics model training.\nBuilding on it, we conclude with a discussion about other potential directions\nof research for addressing this issue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 16:26:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 22:21:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 03:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

Instead, we enhance depth measurements on\nthe sensed images a priori, exploiting inherent 3D geometric correlation across\nviews, before synthesizing a 3D point cloud from the improved measurements. By\nenhancing closer to the actual sensing process, we benefit from optimization\ntargeting specifically the depth image formation model, before subsequent\nprocessing steps that can further obscure measurement errors.

In a popular class of models, the fast radio bursts (FRBs)\nare created by giant magnetic flares of a hyper-active magnetar driven by fast\nambipolar diffusion in the core. We point out that in this scenario the\nmagnetar is expected to precess freely with a period of hours to weeks.

The ultra-strong field invoked in the magnetar model\nprovides: (1) energy for the frequent giant flares, (2) the high rate of\nambipolar diffusion, releasing the magnetic energy on the timescale $\\sim\n10^9$s, (3) the core temperature $T\\approx 10^9$K, likely above the critical\ntemperature for neutron superfluidity, (4) strong magnetospheric torques, which\nefficiently spin down the star, and (5) deformation with ellipticity $\\epsilon>\n10^{-6}$, much greater than the rotational deformation.

We introduce an information theoretic metric to\nmeasure the information freshness at the destination, and name it as\ngeneralized Age of Information (GAoI).

Using tDMRG, we simulate the time evolution of a\nmany-body quantum state of electrons and localized spins, where the former are\ninjected as a spin-polarized current pulse while the latter comprise a quantum\nHeisenberg ferromagnetic metallic (FM) spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain initially\nin the ground state with spin-polarization antiparallel to that of injected\nelectrons. The quantum STT reverses the direction of localized spins, but\nwithout rotation from the initial orientation, when the number of injected\nelectrons exceeds the number of localized spins. Such nonclassical reversal,\nwhich is absent from LLG dynamics, is strikingly inhomogeneous across the FM\nchain and it can be accompanied by reduction of the magnetization associated\nwith localized spins, even to zero at specific locations. This is because\nquantum STT generates a highly entangled nonequilibrium many-body state of all\nflowing and localized spins, despite starting from the initially unentangled\nground state of a mundane FM. Furthermore, the mutual information between\nlocalized spins at the FM edges remains nonzero even at infinite separation as\nthe signature of dynamical buildup of long-range entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:04:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:09:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2020 00:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 20:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Within the auxiliary master equation approach combined with a\nscheme based on matrix product states (MPS) we are able to directly address the\ncurrent-carrying steady state. Starting with the equilibrium situation, we\nfirst corroborate our results by comparing with a direct numerical evaluation\nof ground state spectral properties of the system by MPS.

In the Kondo regime the resonance in the spectral function is\nsplitted as a function of the increasing bias voltage. The local moment regime,\ninstead, displays a dip in the spectrum near the position of the chemical\npotentials.

While these analyses help policy analysts and economists\ndetermine coverage, inform policy, and guide resource allocation, they are\nstatistically challenging for several reasons. Cost and effectiveness are\ncorrelated and follow complex joint distributions which are difficult to\ncapture parametrically. Effectiveness (often measured as increased survival\ntime) and accumulated cost tends to be right-censored in many applications.\nMoreover, CEAs are often conducted using observational data with non-random\ntreatment assignment. Policy-relevant causal estimation therefore requires\nrobust confounding control. Finally, current CEA methods do not address\ncost-effectiveness heterogeneity in a principled way - often presenting\npopulation-averaged estimates even though significant effect heterogeneity may\nexist. Motivated by these challenges, we develop a nonparametric Bayesian model\nfor joint cost-survival distributions in the presence of censoring.

However, collecting such fully-annotated data is often\ndifficult or expensive for real-world applications, which restricts the power\nof deep neural networks in practice. Alternatively, humans can detect new\nobjects with little annotation burden, since humans often use the prior\nknowledge to identify new objects with few elaborately-annotated examples, and\nsubsequently generalize this capacity by exploiting objects from wild images.\nInspired by this procedure of learning to detect, we propose a novel\nProgressive Object Transfer Detection (POTD) framework. Specifically, we make\nthree main contributions in this paper. First, POTD can leverage various object\nsupervision of different domains effectively into a progressive detection\nprocedure. Via such human-like learning, one can boost a target detection task\nwith few annotations. Second, POTD consists of two delicate transfer stages,\ni.e., Low-Shot Transfer Detection (LSTD), and Weakly-Supervised Transfer\nDetection (WSTD). In LSTD, we distill the implicit object knowledge of source\ndetector to enhance target detector with few annotations. It can effectively\nwarm up WSTD later on. In WSTD, we design a recurrent object labelling\nmechanism for learning to annotate weakly-labeled images. More importantly, we\nexploit the reliable object supervision from LSTD, which can further enhance\nthe robustness of target detector in the WSTD stage. Finally, we perform\nextensive experiments on a number of challenging detection benchmarks with\ndifferent settings.

In the Einstein frame the dynamical equation for\nthe metric leads to the Damour-Navier-Stokes (DNS) equation with an external\nforcing term, coming from the scalar field in ST gravity. In the Jordan frame\nthe situation is more subtle. We observe that finding the DNS equation in this\nframe can lead to two pictures. In one picture, the usual DNS equation is\nmodified by a Coriolis-like force term, which originates completely from the\npresence of a non-minimally coupled scalar field ($\\phi$) on the gravity side.\nMoreover, the identified fluid variables are no longer conformally equivalent\nwith those in the Einstein frame. However, this picture is consistent with the\nsaturation of Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound. In the other picture, we find\nthe standard DNS equation (i.e. without the Coriolis-like force), with the\nfluid variables conformally equivalent with those in Einstein frame. But, the\nsecond picture, may not agree with the KSS bound for some values of $\\phi$. We\nconclude by rewriting the Raychaudhuri equation and the tidal force equation in\nterms of the relevant parameters to demonstrate how the expansion scalar and\nthe shear-tensor evolve in the spacetime.

In this\npaper, we first study theoretically why the learning rate warm-up stage is\nessential and show that the location of layer normalization matters.\nSpecifically, we prove with mean field theory that at initialization, for the\noriginal-designed Post-LN Transformer, which places the layer normalization\nbetween the residual blocks, the expected gradients of the parameters near the\noutput layer are large. Therefore, using a large learning rate on those\ngradients makes the training unstable. The warm-up stage is practically helpful\nfor avoiding this problem. On the other hand, our theory also shows that if the\nlayer normalization is put inside the residual blocks (recently proposed as\nPre-LN Transformer), the gradients are well-behaved at initialization. This\nmotivates us to remove the warm-up stage for the training of Pre-LN\nTransformers.

The studies focused on valley degree of freedom now form an\nemerging field of condensed matter physics, i.e. valleytronics, whose\ndevelopment is exactly following that of spintronics which focuses on the spin\ndegree of freedom. Here, in analogy to half-metals in spintronics with one spin\nchannel is conducting whereas the other is insulating, we propose the concept\nof half-valley-metal, in which conduction electrons are intrinsically 100%\nvalley polarized, as well as 100% spin-polarized even when spin-orbit\ninteractions are considered. Combining first-principles calculations with\ntwo-band kp model, the physical mechanism to form the half-valley-metal is\nilluminated. Taking the ferrovalley H-FeCl2 monolayer with strong exchange\ninteraction as an example, we find that the strong electron correlation effect\ncan induce the ferrovalley to half-valley-metal transition. Due to the\nvalley-dependent optical selection rules, such system could be transparent to,\ne.g., left-circularly polarized light, yet the right-circularly polarized light\nwill be reflected, which can in turn be used as a crucial method to detect\nhalf-valley-metal state. In addition, we find that in the so obtained\nhalf-valley-metal state, the conduction valley demonstrates Dirac cone-like\nlinear energy dispersion. Interestingly, with the increase of the correlation\neffect, the system becomes insulating again with all valleys follow same\noptical selection rule. We confirm that in this specific case, the valence\nbands, which consist of single spin, possess non-zero Chern number and\nconsequently intrinsic quantum anomalous valley Hall effect emerges.

We develop a\nnonequilibrium Green's function based transport theory in which the central\nregion atoms and, more importantly, atoms on molecule-electrode interfaces are\nallowed to move. The separation of time-scales of slow nuclear motion and fast\nelectronic dynamics enables the algebraic solution of the Kadanoff-Baym\nequations in the Wigner space. As a result, analytical expressions for\ndynamical corrections to the adiabatically computed Green's functions are\nproduced. These dynamical corrections depend not only on the instantaneous\nmolecular geometry but also on the nuclear velocities. To make the theoretical\napproach fully self-consistent, the same time-separation approach is used to\ndevelop expressions for the adiabatic, dissipative, and stochastic components\nof current-induced forces in terms of adiabatic Green's functions. Using these\ncurrent induced forces, the equation of motion for the nuclear degrees of\nfreedom is cast in the form of a Langevin equation. The theory is applied to\nmodel molecular electronic junctions.

This phenomenon poses severe security threat\nand calls for in-depth investigation of the robustness of deep learning models.\nWith the emergence of neural networks for graph structured data, similar\ninvestigations are urged to understand their robustness. It has been found that\nadversarially perturbing the graph structure and/or node features may result in\na significant degradation of the model performance. In this work, we show from\na different angle that such fragility similarly occurs if the graph contains a\nfew bad-actor nodes, which compromise a trained graph neural network through\nflipping the connections to any targeted victim. Worse, the bad actors found\nfor one graph model severely compromise other models as well. We call the bad\nactors ``anchor nodes'' and propose an algorithm, named GUA, to identify them.\nThorough empirical investigations suggest an interesting finding that the\nanchor nodes often belong to the same class; and they also corroborate the\nintuitive trade-off between the number of anchor nodes and the attack success\nrate.

In this paper, to alleviate those limitations, we propose a Balanced\nMulti-Task Learning (BMTL) framework.

If Alice makes an incorrect\nassumption about the set of true states for Bob's system, she will obtain a\nsmoothed state that is suboptimal, and, worse, may be unrealizable (not\ncorresponding to a valid evolution for the true states) or even unphysical (not\nrepresented by a state matrix $\\rho\\geq0$).

Depending on the outcome of\nthe first phase of JWST observations of the planets, this initiative could\nbecome the seed of a major JWST Legacy Program devoted to the study of\nTRAPPIST-1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 05:03:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 23:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

Its originality\nlies with a new transformative numerical approach to the traditional eigenvalue\nalgorithm design - the FEAST algorithm. The algorithm gathers key elements from\ncomplex analysis, numerical linear algebra and approximation theory, to\nconstruct an optimal subspace iteration technique using approximate spectral\nprojectors. FEAST can be used for solving both standard and generalized forms\nof the Hermitian or non-Hermitian problems (linear or non-linear), and it\nbelongs to the family of contour integration eigensolvers. FEAST's main\ncomputational task consists of a numerical quadrature computation that involves\nsolving independent linear systems along a complex contour, each with multiple\nright hand sides. In v4.0, FEAST has been reimplemented using an inverse\nresidual iteration algorithm which enables the linear systems to be solved with\nvery low accuracy (in single precision) with no impact on the FEAST double\nprecision convergence rate. As a result, v4.0 is on average 3-4 times faster\nthan v2.1 and v3.0 using new default optimization parameters (v2.1 has been\nfeatured as Intel-MKL's principal HPC eigensolver since 2013). v4.0 also\nimplements new important features such as IFEAST (using Inexact Iterative\nsolver), Non-linear polynomial FEAST, and PFEAST with its 3-MPI levels of\nparallelism.

In the low level, an intra-task graph neural network is\nresponsible of learning a powerful representation for each data point in a task\nby aggregating its neighbors. Based on the learned representation, a task\nembedding can be generated for each task in a similar way to max pooling.

Then\nthe task embedding of one task is used to augment the feature representation of\ndata points in this task. Moreover, for classification tasks, an inter-class\ngraph neural network is introduced to conduct similar operations on a finer\ngranularity, i.e., the class level, to generate class embeddings for each class\nin all the tasks use class embeddings to augment the feature representation.\nThe proposed feature augmentation strategy can be used in many deep multi-task\nlearning models. we analyze the HGNN in terms of training and generalization\nlosses.

In this article we\nstudy the apolar algebra of a product of linear forms, which generalizes the\ncase of monomials and connects to the geometry of hyperplane arrangements. In\nthe first part of the article we provide a bound on the Waring rank of a\nproduct of linear forms under certain genericity assumptions; for this we use\nthe defining equations of so-called star configurations due to Geramita,\nHarbourne, and Migliore.

The presence of the MFR is evidenced\nby a coherent set of magnetic field lines with twist number above unity. Below\nthe MFR a current sheet is shown in the model, suggesting that tether-cutting\nreconnection plays a key role in the MFR formation. The MFR's flux grows as\nmore and more field lines are twisted due to continuous injection of magnetic\nhelicity by the photospheric motions.

We also\nconsider the cases with and without previous feedback from the high-mass star\nin the form of ionising radiation and stellar winds. The supernova is able to\nfind weak points in the cloud and create channels through which it can escape,\nleaving much of the well shielded cloud largely unaffected. This effect is\nincreased when the channels are pre-existing due to the effects of previous\nstellar feedback. The expanding supernova deposits its energy in the gas that\nis in these exposed channels, and hence sweeps up less mass when feedback has\nalready occurred, resulting in faster outflows with less radiative losses. The\nfull impact of the supernova explosion is then able to impact the larger scale\nof the galaxy in which it abides. We conclude that supernova explosions only\nhave moderate effects on their dense natal environments but that with\npre-existing feedback, the energetic effects of the supernova are able to\nescape and affect the wider scale medium of the galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 09:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Due to the UAV swarm's high working altitude\nand strong ground-to-air channels, it is generally exposed to multiple ground\nbase stations (GBSs), while the GBSs that are serving ground users (occupied\nGBSs) can generate strong interference to the UAV swarm. To tackle this issue,\nwe propose a novel two-phase transmission protocol by exploiting cellular plus\ndevice-to-device (D2D) communication for the UAV swarm. In Phase I, one swarm\nhead is chosen for ground-to-air channel estimation, and all the GBSs that are\nnot serving ground users (available GBSs) transmit a common control message to\nthe UAV swarm simultaneously, using the same cellular frequency band, to combat\nthe strong interference from occupied GBSs. In Phase II, all the UAVs that have\ndecoded the common control message in Phase I further relay it to the other\nUAVs in the swarm via D2D communication, by exploiting the less interfered D2D\nfrequency band and the proximity among UAVs. In this paper, we aim to\ncharacterize the reliability performance of the above two-phase protocol, i.e.,\nthe expected percentage of UAVs in the swarm that can decode the common control\nmessage, which is a non-trivial problem due to the complex system setup and the\nintricate coupling between the two phases. Nevertheless, we manage to obtain an\napproximated expression of the reliability performance of interest, under\nreasonable assumptions and with the aid of the Pearson distributions. Numerical\nresults validate the accuracy of our analytical results and show the\neffectiveness of our protocol over other benchmark protocols. We also study the\neffect of key system parameters on the reliability performance, to reveal\nuseful insights on the practical system design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 10:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-13"}

It is observed that\nfor a given magnetic field, the dominant contribution to the collisional energy\nloss arises from Compton scattering process i.e., $Qg\\rightarrow Qg$. On the\nother hand, of the two processes, the Coulomb scattering i.e., $Qq\\rightarrow\nQq$ is more sensitive to the magnetic field. The net collisional energy loss is\nseen to increase with increase in the magnetic field. For a reasonable strength\nof the magnetic field, the field dependent contribution to the collisional\nenergy loss is of the same order as to the case without magnetic field which\ncan be important for the jet quenching phenomena in the heavy ion collision\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 11:21:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 09:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-25"}

Although\nless frequent than binary-single encounters, binary-binary interactions lead to\na much richer range of possibilities such as the formation of stable triple\nsystems. Here, we focus on the regime of distant binary-binary encounters,\ni.e., two binaries approaching each other on an unbound orbit with a periapsis\ndistance Q much larger than the internal binary separations. This `secular'\nregime gives rise to changes in the orbital eccentricities and orientations,\nwhich we study using analytic considerations and numerical integrations. We\nshow that `direct' interactions between the three orbits only occur starting at\na high expansion order of the Hamiltonian (hexadecupole order), and that the\nbackreaction of the outer orbit on the inner two orbits at lower expansion\norders is weak. Therefore, to good approximation, one can obtain the changes of\neach orbit by using previously-known analytic results for binary-single\ninteractions, and replacing the mass of the third body with the total mass of\nthe companion binary.

To boost the\nthroughput in systems designed for solving these rearrangement problems, it is\nessential to minimize the number of atomic operations, e.g., the pick-n-places\nof individual objects. However, this optimization task poses a rather difficult\nchallenge due to complex inter-dependency between objects, especially in\nhigh-density settings.\n  In tackling the aforementioned challenges, we develop a novel algorithmic\ntool, Rubik Tables, that provides a clean abstraction of object rearrangement\nproblems as the proxy problem of shuffling items stored in a table or lattice.\nIn its basic form, a Rubik Table is an $n\\times n$ table containing $n^2$\nitems. We show that the reconfiguration of items in such a Rubik Table can be\nachieved using at most $2n$ column/row shuffles in the partially labeled\nsetting, where each column (resp., row) shuffle may arbitrarily permute the\nitems stored in a column (resp., row) of the table. When items are fully\ndistinguishable, additional $n$ shuffles are needed. Rubik Tables allow many\ngeneralizations, e.g., to higher dimensions.\n  Using Rubik Table, we have designed a first constant-factor optimal algorithm\nfor stack rearrangement problems. We show that, for $nd$ items stored in $n$\nstacks of depth $d$ each, using one empty stack as the swap space, $O(nd)$\nstack pop-push operations are sufficient for an arbitrary reconfiguration of\nthe stacks where $d \\le n^{\\frac{m}{2}}$ for arbitrary fixed $m >0$. Rubik\nTable results also allow the development of constant-factor optimal solutions\nfor solving multi-robot motion planning problems under extreme robot density.\nThese algorithms based on Rubik Table results run in low-polynomial time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 13:37:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 02:42:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 15:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

In addition, most state-of-the-art background subtraction\nalgorithms are not real-time, which makes them unsuitable for real-world\napplications. In this paper, we present a novel background subtraction\nalgorithm called Real-Time Semantic Background Subtraction (denoted RT-SBS)\nwhich extends SBS for real-time constrained applications while keeping similar\nperformances. RT-SBS effectively combines a real-time background subtraction\nalgorithm with high-quality semantic information which can be provided at a\nslower pace, independently for each pixel. We show that RT-SBS coupled with\nViBe sets a new state of the art for real-time background subtraction\nalgorithms and even competes with the non real-time state-of-the-art ones.

Since resonant relaxation conserves semimajor axes, these clusters\nshould be in the maximum-entropy state consistent with the given semimajor axis\ndistribution. We determine these maximum-entropy equilibria in a simplified\nmodel in which all of the stars have the same semimajor axes.

By fine-tuning, we\nobtained 30.40%, 7.99%, and 8.61% absolute improvement on IEMOCAP, MSP-Podcast,\nand Crema-D respectively over baseline model with no pre-training. Finally, we\npresent results on the effect of emotion on speaker verification. We observed\nthat speaker verification performance is prone to changes in test speaker\nemotions. We found that trials with angry utterances performed worst in all\nthree datasets. We hope our analysis will initiate a new line of research in\nthe speaker recognition community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 15:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-13"}

The most obvious way to increase sample size is by\npooling scans from independent studies.

In this work, we combine 35,320 magnetic resonance\nimages of the brain from 17 studies to examine bias in neuroimaging. In the\nfirst experiment, Name That Dataset, we provide empirical evidence for the\npresence of bias by showing that scans can be correctly assigned to their\nrespective dataset with 71.5% accuracy. Given such evidence, we take a closer\nlook at confounding bias, which is often viewed as the main shortcoming in\nobservational studies.

Kolmogorov complexity is then used to decide whether the confounded\nor the causal model provides the simplest factorization of the graphical model.\nFinally, we present methods for dataset harmonization and study their ability\nto remove bias in imaging features. In particular, we propose an extension of\nthe recently introduced ComBat algorithm to control for global variation across\nimage features, inspired by adjusting for population stratification in\ngenetics. Our results demonstrate that harmonization can reduce\ndataset-specific information in image features. Further, confounding bias can\nbe reduced and even turned into a causal relationship.

We also propose to evaluate the model-level quality of\nNLG models with sample-level comparison results with skill rating system. While\nable to be trained in a fully self-supervised fashion, our model can be further\nfine-tuned with a little amount of human preference annotation to better\nimitate human judgment. In addition to evaluating trained models, we propose to\napply our model as a performance indicator during training for better\nhyperparameter tuning and early-stopping. We evaluate our approach on both\nstory generation and chit-chat dialogue response generation. Experimental\nresults show that our model correlates better with human preference compared\nwith previous automated evaluation approaches. Training with the proposed\nmetric yields better performance in human evaluation, which further\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 15:52:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-13"}

For a I) more elaborate feature-based EEG analysis, and II)\nin-depth comparisons of both approaches, here we first develop a comprehensive\nfeature-based framework, and then compare this framework to state-of-the-art\nend-to-end methods. To this aim, we apply the proposed feature-based framework\nand deep neural networks including an EEG-optimized temporal convolutional\nnetwork (TCN) to the task of pathological versus non-pathological EEG\nclassification. For a robust comparison, we chose the Temple University\nHospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG Corpus (v2.0.0), which contains approximately 3000\nEEG recordings. The results demonstrate that the proposed feature-based\ndecoding framework can achieve accuracies on the same level as state-of-the-art\ndeep neural networks.

Since underwater optical wireless communications (UOWC) suffers\nfrom limited range, it requires effective multi-hop routing solutions.

OR improves the packet\ndelivery ratio as the likelihood of having at least one successful packet\nreception is much higher than that in conventional unicast routing.

Our evaluation of a\nTaurus switch ASIC -- supporting several real-world models -- shows that Taurus\noperates orders of magnitude faster than a server-based control plane while\nincreasing area by 3.8% and latency for line-rate ML models by up to 221 ns.\nFurthermore, our Taurus FPGA prototype achieves full model accuracy and detects\ntwo orders of magnitude more events than a state-of-the-art control-plane\nanomaly-detection system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 09:18:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 20:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

The M-IAM scheme has larger pseudo pilot magnitude than other\nconventional preamble schemes, namely the interference approximation method\n(IAM) with its versions (IAM-C) and (E-IAM-C); in addition to the novel\npreamble design (NPS). In addition, the proposed (M-IAM) scheme is\ncharacterized by the lower transmitted power needed.

However, the nature of the transition to the statistical regime as a\nfunction of the molecular parameters is far from being completely understood.\nHere, we use tools from nonlinear dynamics to study the transition to\nstatisticality in a model unimolecular reaction by explicitly visulaizing the\nhigh dimensional classical phase space. We identify generic features in the\nphase space involving the intersection of two or more independent anharmonic\nresonances and show that the presence of correlated, but chaotic,\nintramolecular dynamics near such junctions leads to nonstatisticality.\nInterestingly, akin to the stability of asteroids in the Solar System,\nmolecules can stay protected from dissociation at the junctions for several\npicoseconds due to the phenomenon of stable chaos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 11:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}
