However, to\ndate, these strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields have failed to emulate the\ntunability of real magnetic fields because they are dictated solely by the\nstrain configuration. Here, we overcome this apparent limitation for polaritons\nsupported by strained metasurfaces, which can be realized with classical dipole\nantennas or quantum dipole emitters.

However,\np-value is often misinterpreted, misused or miscommunicated in practice. Part\nof the issue is that existing definitions of p-value are often derived from\nconstructions under specific settings, and a general definition that directly\nreflects the evidence of the null hypothesis is not yet available. In this\narticle, we first propose a general and rigorous definition of p-value that\nfulfills two performance-based characteristics. The performance-based\ndefinition subsumes all existing construction-based definitions of the p-value,\nand justifies their interpretations. The paper further presents a specific\napproach based on confidence distribution to formulate and calculate p-values.\nThis specific way of computing p values has two main advantages. First, it is\napplicable for a wide range of hypothesis testing problems, including the\nstandard one- and two-sided tests, tests with interval-type null,\nintersection-union tests, multivariate tests and so on. Second, it can\nnaturally lead to a coherent interpretation of p-value as evidence in support\nof the null hypothesis, as well as a meaningful measure of degree of such\nsupport. In particular, it places a meaning of a large p-value, e.g. p-value of\n0.8 has more support than 0.5. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the\nwide applicability and computational feasibility of our approach. We show that\nour proposal is effective and can be applied broadly, without further\nconsideration of the form/size of the null space.

We evaluate our\nhybrid autoencoder algorithm using two datasets, the MNIST dataset and MNIST\nFashion dataset. We evaluate the quality of this method by using a downstream\nclassification method where the training is based on quantum RBM-generated\nsamples. Our method overcomes two key limitations in the current 2000-qubit\nD-Wave processor, namely the limited number of qubits available to accommodate\ntypical problem sizes for fully connected quantum objective functions and\nsamples that are binary pixel representations. As a consequence of these\nlimitations we are able to show how we achieved nearly a 22-fold compression\nfactor of grayscale 28 x 28 sized images to binary 6 x 6 sized images with a\nlossy recovery of the original 28 x 28 grayscale images.

A\ndistinguishing characteristic of these second-generation blockchains over\nclassical BFT protocols is that committees change over time as the\nparticipation and the blockchain state evolve. In this paper, we push forward\nin this direction by proposing a formalization of the Dynamic Repeated\nConsensus problem and by providing generic procedures to solve it in the\ncontext of blockchains. Our approach is modular in that one can plug in\ndifferent synchronizers and single-shot consensus instances. To offer a\ncomplete solution, we provide a concrete instantiation, called Tenderbake, and\npresent a blockchain synchronizer and a single-shot consensus algorithm,\nworking in a Byzantine and partially synchronous system model with eventually\nsynchronous clocks. In contrast to recent proposals, our methodology is driven\nby the need to bound the message buffers. This is essential in preventing\nspamming and run-time memory errors. Moreover, Tenderbake processes can\nsynchronize with each other without exchanging messages, leveraging instead the\ninformation stored in the blockchain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 17:28:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 18:56:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 11:21:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 09:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

However, even in presence of clear incentives, the dynamics involved\ncan be incredibly complex. Specifically, formations of large groups of\nsimilarly opinionated individuals could create a condition of `support-bubbles'\nor spontaneous polarization that renders consensus virtually unattainable\n(e.g., the question of the UK exiting the EU). There have been earlier attempts\nin capturing the dynamics of consensus formation in societies through simple\n$Z_2$-symmetric models hoping to capture the essential dynamics of average\nbehaviorof a large number of individuals in a statistical sense. However, in\nabsence of external noise, they tend to reach a frozen state with fragmented\nand polarized states i.e., two or more groups of similarly opinionated groups\nwith frozen dynamics. Here we show in a kinetic exchange opinion model (KEM)\nconsidered on $L \\times L$ square lattices, that while such frozen states could\nbe avoided, an exponentially slow approach to consensus is manifested.\nSpecifically, the system could either reach consensus in a time that scales as\n$L^2$ or a long lived metastable state (termed a domain-wall state) for which\nformation of consensus takes a time scaling as $L^{3.6}$. The latter behavior\nis comparable to some voter-like models with intermediate states studied\npreviously. The late-time anomaly in the time scale is reflected in the\npersistence probability of the model. Finally, the interval of zero-crossing of\nthe average opinion i.e., the time interval over which the average opinion does\nnot change sign is shown to follow a scale free distribution, which is compared\nwith that seen in the opinion surveys regarding Brexit and associated issues in\nthe last 40 years.

Sequence alignment (SA)\nuncovers missing annotations by transferring functional knowledge between\nspecies' sequence-conserved regions. Because SA is imperfect, network alignment\n(NA) complements SA by transferring functional knowledge between conserved\nbiological network, rather than just sequence, regions of different species.\nExisting NA assumes that it is topological similarity (isomorphic-like\nmatching) between network regions that corresponds to the regions' functional\nrelatedness. However, we recently found that functionally unrelated proteins\nare almost as topologically similar as functionally related proteins. So, we\nredefined NA as a data-driven framework, TARA, which learns from network and\nprotein functional data what kind of topological relatedness (rather than\nsimilarity) between proteins corresponds to the proteins' functional\nrelatedness. TARA used topological information (within each network) but not\nsequence information (between proteins across networks).

Methods, An optimized\ngolden angle ordering radial UTE sequence was used to continuously acquire data\nfor 5 minutes. All readouts were grouped to different respiratory motion states\nbased on self-navigator signals, then motion resolved data was reconstructed by\nXD Golden angle RAdial Sparse Parallel reconstruction (XD GRASP). One state\nfrom the motion resolved images was selected as a reference, and motion fields\nfrom the other states to the reference were derived via non-rigid registration.\nFinally, all motion resolved data and motion fields were reconstructed by using\nan iterative motion compensation reconstruction with a total generalized\nvariation sparse constraint.

The approximation ratios of this\nalgorithm have been very widely studied, where it is augmented with an advice\nthat tells the greedy which minimum degree vertex to choose if it is not\nunique. Our main contribution is a new mathematical theory for the design of\nsuch greedy algorithms with efficiently computable advice and for the analysis\nof their approximation ratios.

Recently, it has been observed that turbulent bluff-body wakes\nexhibit a subharmonic resonant response when excited with specific spatial\nsymmetries at twice the natural vortex shedding frequency, which is\nhypothesized to be caused by triadic interactions. The focus of this paper is\nto provide new physical insight into the dynamics of turbulent oscillator\nflows, based on improved mechanistic models informed by a comprehensive\nexperimental study of the turbulent wake behind a D-shaped body under periodic\nforcing. We confirm for the first time the role of resonant triadic\ninteractions in the forced flow by studying the dominant components in the\npower spectra across multiple excitation frequencies and amplitudes. We then\ndevelop an extended Stuart-Landau model for the forced global wake mode,\nincorporating parametric and non-harmonic forcing. This model captures the\nsystem dynamics and reveals the boundaries of multiple synchronization regions.\nFurther, it is possible to identify model coefficients from sparse measurement\ndata, making it applicable to a wide range of turbulent oscillator flows.

This, in turn, depends on discovery and\ncharacterization of binary companions for large numbers of different kinds of\nstars in different chemical and dynamical environments. Current stellar\nspectroscopic surveys observe hundreds of thousands to millions of stars with\n(typically) few observational epochs, which allows binary discovery but makes\norbital characterization challenging. We use a custom Monte Carlo sampler (The\nJoker) to perform discovery and characterization of binary systems through\nradial-velocities, in the regime of sparse, noisy, and poorly sampled\nmulti-epoch data. We use it to generate posterior samplings in Keplerian\nparameters for 232,531 sources released in APOGEE Data Release 16. Our final\ncatalog contains 19,635 high-confidence close-binary (P < few years, a < few\nAU) systems that show interesting relationships between binary occurrence rate\nand location in the color-magnitude diagram. We find notable faint companions\nat high masses (black-hole candidates), at low masses (substellar candidates),\nand at very close separations (mass-transfer candidates). We also use the\nposterior samplings in a (toy) hierarchical inference to measure the\nlong-period binary-star eccentricity distribution. We release the full set of\nposterior samplings for the entire parent sample of 232,531 stars. This set of\nsamplings involves no heuristic \"discovery\" threshold and therefore can be used\nfor myriad statistical purposes, including hierarchical inferences about\nbinary-star populations and sub-threshold searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 13:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

Moreover,\nwe derive the robust MD-CRT for integer vectors when the remaining integer\nmatrices of all the moduli left divided by their greatest common left divisor\n(gcld) are pairwise commutative and coprime. Two different reconstruction\nalgorithms are proposed, and accordingly, two different conditions on the\nremainder error bound for the reconstruction robustness are obtained, which are\nrelated to a quarter of the minimum distance of the lattice generated by the\ngcld of all the moduli or the Smith normal form of the gcld.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 22:52:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 21:02:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 03:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Understanding how stimulation of a particular brain area impacts\nsuch concerted activity is important for gaining basic insights into brain\nfunction and for developing neuromodulation as a therapeutic tool. However, it\nremains difficult to predict the downstream effects of focal stimulation.\nSpecifically, little is known about how the collective oscillatory regime of\nnetwork activity may affect the outcomes of regional perturbations on\ncooperative dynamics. Here, we combine connectome data and biophysical modeling\nto begin filling these gaps. By tuning parameters that control the collective\ndynamics of the network, we identify distinct states of simulated brain\nactivity, and investigate how the distributed effects of stimulation manifest\nin different states. When baseline oscillations are weak, the stimulated area\nexhibits enhanced power and frequency, and due to network interactions, nearby\nregions develop phase locked activity in the excited frequency band.\nImportantly, we find that focal stimulation also causes more distributed\nmodifications to network coherence at regions' baseline oscillation\nfrequencies, and that these effects are better predicted by functional rather\nthan structural connectivity. In contrast, when the network operates in a\nregime of stronger endogenous oscillations, stimulation causes only slight\nshifts in power and frequency, and network averaged changes in coherence are\nmore homogenous across the choice of the stimulated area. In sum, this work\nbuilds upon and extends previous computational studies investigating the\nimpacts of stimulation, and highlights that both the stimulation site, and,\ncrucially, the regime of brain network dynamics, can influence the network wide\nresponses to local perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 23:11:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 22:39:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

Existing works have\ndealt with only simple deep neural networks (DNNs), e.g., only three layers, as\ntargets of model extraction attacks, and hence are not aware of the\neffectiveness of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in dealing with time-series\ndata. In this work, we shed light on the threats of model extraction attacks\nagainst RNNs. We discuss whether a model with a higher accuracy can be\nextracted with a simple RNN from a long short-term memory (LSTM), which is a\nmore complicated and powerful RNN. Specifically, we tackle the following\nproblems. First, in a case of a classification problem, such as image\nrecognition, extraction of an RNN model without final outputs from an LSTM\nmodel is presented by utilizing outputs halfway through the sequence. Next, in\na case of a regression problem. such as in weather forecasting, a new attack by\nnewly configuring a loss function is presented. We conduct experiments on our\nmodel extraction attacks against an RNN and an LSTM trained with publicly\navailable academic datasets.

We report the results from the Major\nAtmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) observations in 2016 along with the\nmulti-wavelength data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and Swift\ninstruments. MAGIC observed 1ES 1959+650 with different emission levels in the\nvery-high-energy (VHE, E >100 GeV) gamma-ray band during 2016. In the long-term\ndata, the X-ray spectrum becomes harder with increasing flux and a hint of a\nsimilar trend is also visible in the VHE band. An exceptionally high VHE flux\nreaching ~ 3 times the Crab Nebula flux was measured by MAGIC on the 13th, 14th\nof June and 1st July 2016 (the highest flux observed since 2002). During these\nflares, the high-energy peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED) lies in\nthe VHE domain and extends up to several TeV. The spectrum in the gamma-ray\n(both Fermi-LAT and VHE bands) and the X-ray bands are quite hard. On 13th June\nand 1st July 2016, the source showed rapid variations of the VHE flux within\ntimescales of less than an hour. A simple one-zone SSC model can describe the\ndata during the flares requiring moderate to high values of the Doppler factors\n(>=30-60).

In this report, the results of a\nthorough investigation of dc magnetization and ac susceptibility (ACS) in\nsingle-phase LaSrCoO$_4$ provide clinching evidence for a thermodynamic\nparamagnetic (PM) - ferromagnetic (FM) phase transition at T$_{c}$ = 220.5 K,\nfollowed at lower temperature (T$_{g}$ = 7.7 K) by a transition to the cluster\nspin glass (CSG) state. Analysis of the low-field Arrott plot isotherms, in the\ncritical region near T$_{c}$, in terms of the Aharony-Pytte scaling equation of\nstate clearly establishes that the PM-FM transition is basically driven by\nrandom magnetic anisotropy (RMA). For temperatures below $\\approx$ 30 K, large\nenough RMA destroys long-range FM order by breaking up the infinite FM network\ninto FM clusters of finite size and leads to the formation of a CSG state at\ntemperatures T $\\lesssim$ 8 K by promoting freezing of finite FM clusters in\nrandom orientations.

Previous work mainly focuses on image-level\nfeature representations, which actually cannot effectively estimate a class's\ndistribution due to the scarcity of samples. Some recent work shows that local\ndescriptor based representations can achieve richer representations than\nimage-level based representations. However, such works are still based on a\nless effective instance-level metric, especially a symmetric metric, to measure\nthe relations between query images and support classes. Given the natural\nasymmetric relation between a query image and a support class, we argue that an\nasymmetric measure is more suitable for metric-based few-shot learning. To that\nend, we propose a novel Asymmetric Distribution Measure (ADM) network for\nfew-shot learning by calculating a joint local and global asymmetric measure\nbetween two multivariate local distributions of queries and classes. Moreover,\na task-aware Contrastive Measure Strategy (CMS) is proposed to further enhance\nthe measure function.

The second resource is an exhaustive list of stop lemmas created\nfrom 12 corpora across multiple domains, consisting of over 13 million words,\nfrom which more than 200,000 lemmas were generated, and 11 publicly available\nstop word lists comprising over 1000 words, from which nearly 400 unique lemmas\nwere generated. This research lays emphasis on the use of stop lemmas instead\nof stop words owing to the presence of various, but not all morphological forms\nof a word in stop word lists, as opposed to the presence of only the root form\nof the word, from which variations could be derived if required. It was also\nobserved that stop lemmas were more consistent across multiple sources as\ncompared to stop words. In order to generate a stop lemma list, the parts of\nspeech of the lemmas were investigated but rejected as it was found that there\nwas no significant correlation between the rank of a word in the frequency list\nand its part of speech. The stop lemma list was assessed using a comparative\nmethod.

Our\nmethod relies on measuring the magnetoimpedance (MI) response of DPPH through a\ncopper strip coil that encloses DPPH. In contrast to commercial EPR which\nmeasures only the field derivative of power absorption, our method enables us\nto deduce both absorption and dispersion. Changes in resistance (R) and\nreactance (X) of the copper strip while sweeping an external dc magnetic field,\nwere measured for different frequencies (f = 0.9 to 2.5 GHz) of radio-frequency\ncurrent in the coil.

Adding small perturbations on examples\ncauses a good-performance model to misclassify the crafted examples, without\ncategory differences in the human eyes, and fools deep models successfully.\nThere are two requirements for generating adversarial examples: the attack\nsuccess rate and image fidelity metrics. Generally, perturbations are increased\nto ensure the adversarial examples' high attack success rate; however, the\nadversarial examples obtained have poor concealment. To alleviate the tradeoff\nbetween the attack success rate and image fidelity, we propose a method named\nAdvJND, adding visual model coefficients, just noticeable difference\ncoefficients, in the constraint of a distortion function when generating\nadversarial examples. In fact, the visual subjective feeling of the human eyes\nis added as a priori information, which decides the distribution of\nperturbations, to improve the image quality of adversarial examples. We tested\nour method on the FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and MiniImageNet datasets.

However, with the developing technology, radars have become more\ncompact and affordable to use in a building, in a car, in a drone or even in a\nwristwatch. In the near future, radar-equipped IoT platforms will start to\nappear increasingly. For each IoT platform, dual use of spectrum with dual\naperture is required for sensing and communicating when using conventional\napproaches. For the radar sensing IoT devices, the emission from the radar and\ncommunication circuitry is the main reason of the increase in energy\nconsumption. Furthermore, an increasing number of radars emerges as congested\nspectrum, and RF convergence between radars and communication systems becomes\nmore likely to present itself.

Typical\noperationalizations of Granger causality make a strong assumption that every\ntime point of the effect time series is influenced by a combination of other\ntime series with a fixed time delay. The assumption of fixed time delay also\nexists in Transfer Entropy, which is considered to be a non-linear version of\nGranger causality. However, the assumption of the fixed time delay does not\nhold in many applications, such as collective behavior, financial markets, and\nmany natural phenomena. To address this issue, we develop Variable-lag Granger\ncausality and Variable-lag Transfer Entropy, generalizations of both Granger\ncausality and Transfer Entropy that relax the assumption of the fixed time\ndelay and allow causes to influence effects with arbitrary time delays. In\naddition, we propose methods for inferring both variable-lag Granger causality\nand Transfer Entropy relations. In our approaches, we utilize an optimal\nwarping path of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to infer variable-lag causal\nrelations. We demonstrate our approaches on an application for studying\ncoordinated collective behavior and other real-world casual-inference datasets\nand show that our proposed approaches perform better than several existing\nmethods in both simulated and real-world datasets.

In practice, we\npropose a threshold and probabilistic distribution joint method to segment the\ntesting instances into seen, unseen and uncertain domains.

Mainly we focus on the design principle for generating\nan anti-phase state between adjacent nodes in a complex network. We establish\nthat a partial negative control throughout the branches of a spanning tree\ninside the positively coupled limit-cycle oscillators works efficiently well in\ncomparison with randomly chosen negative links to establish zero frustration\n(anti-phase synchronization) in bipartite graphs. Based on the emergence of\nzero frustration, we develop a universal 0-$\\pi$ rule to understand the\nanti-phase synchronization in a bipartite graph. Further, this rule is used to\nconstruct a non-bipartite graph for a given non-zero frustrated value. We\nfinally show the generality of 0-$\\pi$ rule by implementing it in arbitrary\nundirected non-bipartite graphs of attractive-repulsively coupled limit-cycle\noscillators and successfully calculate the non-zero frustration value which\nmatches with numerical data. The validation of the rule is checked through the\nbifurcation analysis of small networks. Our work may unveil the underlying\nmechanism of several synchronization phenomena that exist in a network of\noscillators having a mixed type of coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2020 07:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

Up\nuntil now, adversarial training has been the most successful defense against\nadversarial attacks. To increase adversarial robustness, a DNN can be trained\nwith a combination of benign and adversarial examples generated by first-order\nmethods. However, in state-of-the-art first-order attacks, adversarial examples\nwith sign gradients retain the sign information of each gradient component but\ndiscard the relative magnitude between components. In this work, we replace\nsign gradients with quantized gradients. Gradient quantization not only\npreserves the sign information, but also keeps the relative magnitude between\ncomponents. Experiments show white-box first-order attacks with quantized\ngradients outperform their variants with sign gradients on multiple datasets.\nNotably, our BLOB\\_QG attack achieves an accuracy of $88.32\\%$ on the secret\nMNIST model from the MNIST Challenge and it outperforms all other methods on\nthe leaderboard of white-box attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2020 14:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-07"}
