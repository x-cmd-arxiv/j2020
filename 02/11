We\npropose a novel visual metaphor capable of providing a static overview of all\nhierarchical changes over time, as well as clearly outlining the hierarchical\nstructure at each individual time step. Our method allows for smooth\ntransitions between tree maps and nested streamgraphs, enabling the exploration\nof the trade-off between dynamic behavior and hierarchical structure.

In\na recent paper, we illustrated that exoplanets can orbit through the radio\nphotosphere of the wind of the host star, a region that is optically thick at a\nspecific frequency, for a large fraction of their orbits. As a result, radio\nemission originating from the planet could be absorbed or `eclipsed' by the\nwind of the host star.

Critically, the retrieval algorithm not only desires high recall but\nalso requires to be highly efficient, returning candidates in time sublinear to\nthe number of documents. Unlike the scoring phase witnessing significant\nadvances recently due to the BERT-style pre-training tasks on cross-attention\nmodels, the retrieval phase remains less well studied.

More precisely, it is well-known that in\nwell-mixed/homogeneous/all-to-all-coupled systems, one may derive mean-field\nlimit equations such as Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations (VFPEs). A mesoscopic\nVFPE describes the probability of finding a single vertex/particle in a certain\nstate, forming a bridge between microscopic statistical physics and macroscopic\nfluid-type approximations. One major obstacle in this framework is to\nincorporate complex network structures into limiting equations. In many cases,\nonly heuristic approximations exist, or the limits rely on particular classes\nof integral operators. In this paper, we notice that there is a much more\nelegant, and profoundly more general, way available due to recent progress in\nthe theory of graph limits.

Although epithelial monolayers are\noften modeled as two-dimensional (2D) elastic surfaces, they distinguish\nthemselves from conventional thin elastic plates in three important ways - the\npresence of an apical-basal polarity, spatial variability of cellular\nthickness, and their nonequilibrium active nature. Here, we develop a minimal\ncontinuum model of a planar epithelial tissue as an active elastic material\nthat incorporates all these features. We start from a full three-dimensional\n(3D)description of the tissue and derive an effective 2D model that captures,\nthrough the curvature of the apical surface, both the apical-basal asymmetry\nand the spatial geometry of the tissue. Crucially, variations of active\nstresses across the apical-basal axis lead to active torques that can drive\ncurvature transitions. By identifying four distinct sources of activity, we\nfind that bulk active stresses arising from actomyosin contractility and growth\ncompete with boundary active tensions due to localized actomyosin cables and\nlamellipodial activity to generate the various states spanning the morphospace\nof a planar epithelium. Our treatment hence unifies 3D shape deformations\nthrough the coupled mechanics of apical curvature change and in-plane\nexpansion/contraction of substrate-adhered tissues.

With very anisotropic friction, efficient motions\ninvolve coasting in low-drag states, with rapid and asymmetric power and\nrecovery strokes. As the anisotropy decreases, burst-and-coast motions change\nto motions with long power strokes and short recovery strokes, and roughly\nconstant interlink angle velocity on each. These motions are seen in the spaces\nof sinusoidal and power-law motions described by two and five parameters,\nrespectively. Allowing the duty cycle to vary greatly increases the motions'\nefficiency compared to the case of symmetric power and recovery strokes.\nAllowing further variations in the concavity of the power and recovery strokes\nimproves the efficiency further only when friction is very anisotropic. Near\nisotropic friction, a variety of optimally efficient motions are found with\nmore complex waveforms. Many of the optimal sinusoidal and power-law motions\nare similar to those that we find with an optimization search in the space of\nmore general periodic functions (truncated Fourier series).

However, theoretical models\ndeveloped have focused on describing specific deformation modes (e.g., beam\nbending and uniaxial contraction) in the absence of mechanical loads, with only\nlimited attention to the interplay between mechanical stress and light-induced\ndeformation. This paper explores photomechanical coupling in a photoactive\nnematic elastomer under both light illumination and mechanical stress. We begin\nwith a continuum framework built on the free energy developed by Corbett and\nWarner (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2006). Mechanical stress leads to nematic alignment\nparallel to a uniaxial tensile stress. In the absence of mechanical stress, in\nthe photo-stationary state where the system reaches equilibrium, the nematic\ndirector tends to align perpendicular to the polarization of a linearly\npolarized light. However, sufficient illumination can destroy nematic order\nthrough a first-order nematic-isotropic phase transition which is accompanied\nby a snap through deformation. Combined illumination and mechanical stress can\nlead to an exchange of stability accompanied by stripe domains. Finally, the\nstress-intensity phase diagram shows a critical point that may be of interest\nfor energy conversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 18:14:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 04:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

We show that this non-detection of the reflection\nfeatures cannot be explained by the lower signal-to-noise at lower flux, but is\ninstead caused by physical changes in the accretion flow. Simulating synthetic\nNuSTAR observations on a grid of inner disk radius, disk ionisation, and\nreflection fraction, we find that the disappearance of the reflection features\ncan be explained by either increased disk ionisation ($\\log \\xi \\geq 4.1$) or a\nmuch decreased reflection fraction. A changing disk truncation alone, however,\ncannot account for the lack of reprocessed Fe-K$\\alpha$ emission. The required\nincrease in ionisation parameter could occur if the inner accretion flow\nevaporates from a thin disk into a geometrically thicker flow, such as the\ncommonly assumed formation of an radiatively inefficient accretion flow at\nlower mass accretion rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 18:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Based on the symmetry of the chosen POVM, the interferometer acting\non the initial quantum system can be divided into a sequence of three different\nunitary operations. These operations act independently on each vertical sector,\nor layer, of the circuit, which simplifies their determination. We have thus\nobtained circuits such that the number of beam splitters obeys a polynomial\nfunction of degree 3 with the quantum system dimension, whereas in current\nproposals this quantity grows with a polynomial function of degree 4. Besides\nthat, the optical depth is reduced from a quadratic to a linear function of the\nquantum system dimension in our scheme.

It can potentially also augment computers in doing tasks that\nhumans do effortlessly in day-to-day activities. This paper builds upon key\nideas to build perception of touch sounds without access to any ground-truth\ndata. We show how we can leverage ideas from classical signal processing to get\nlarge amounts of data of any sound of interest with a high precision. These\nsounds are then used, along with the images to map the sounds to a clustered\nspace of the latent representation of these images. This approach, not only\nallows us to learn semantic representation of the possible sounds of interest,\nbut also allows association of different modalities to the learned\ndistinctions. The model trained to map sounds to this clustered representation,\ngives reasonable performance as opposed to expensive methods collecting a lot\nof human annotated data. Such approaches can be used to build a state of art\nperceptual model for any sound of interest described using a few signal\nprocessing features. Daisy chaining high precision sound event detectors using\nsignal processing combined with neural architectures and high dimensional\nclustering of unlabelled data is a vastly powerful idea, and can be explored in\na variety of ways in future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 20:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

Usually, their solutions include\nthe integration of computational technologies such as vehicular networks,\ncentral servers, and roadside units. Most systems use a hybrid approach, which\nmeans they still need a central entity (central server or roadside unit) and\nInternet connection to find out an en-route event as well as alternative routes\nfor vehicles. It is easy to understand the need for a central entity because\nselecting the most appropriate vehicle to perform aforementioned procedures is\na difficult task. In addition to that, as far as we know, there are very few\nsystems that apply the altruistic approach (not selfish behavior) to routing\ndecisions. Because of that, the issue addressed in this work is how to perform\nthe vehicular traffic management, when an en-route event is detected, in a\ndistributed, scalable, and cost-effective fashion. To deal with these issues,\nwe proposed a distributed vehicle traffic management system, named as dEASY\n(distributed vEhicle trAffic management SYstem). The dEASY system was designed\nand implemented on a three-layer architecture, namely environment sensing and\nvehicle ranking, knowledge generation and distribution, and knowledge\nconsumption. Each layer of the dEASY architecture is responsible for dealing\nwith the main issues that were not addressed in related works or could be\nimproved. Simulation results have shown that, compared with other systems from\nthe literature, our proposed system has lower network overhead due to applied\nvehicle selection and broadcast suppression mechanisms. In average, dEASY also\noutperformed all other competitors in what regards to the travel time and time\nlost metrics. Through the analysis of results, it is possible to conclude that\nour infrastructure-less system is scalable and cost-effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 21:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-06"}

We built on a pre-trained 3D U-Net model for abdominal multi-organ\nsegmentation and augmented the dataset either with outlier data (e.g.,\nexemplars for which the baseline algorithm failed) or inliers (e.g., exemplars\nfor which the baseline algorithm worked).

Manual labeling of outliers increased Dice\nscores with outliers by 0.130, compared to an increase of 0.067 with inliers\n(p<0.001, two-tailed paired t-test). By adding 5 to 37 inliers or outliers to\ntraining, we find that the marginal value of adding outliers is higher than\nthat of adding inliers. In summary, improvement on single-organ performance was\nobtained without diminishing multi-organ performance or significantly\nincreasing training time.

The key solution is\nto learn aligned features to the bridge RGB and IR modalities. However, due to\nthe lack of correspondence labels between every pair of RGB and IR images, most\nmethods try to alleviate the variations with set-level alignment by reducing\nthe distance between the entire RGB and IR sets. However, this set-level\nalignment may lead to misalignment of some instances, which limits the\nperformance for RGB-IR Re-ID. Different from existing methods, in this paper,\nwe propose to generate cross-modality paired-images and perform both global\nset-level and fine-grained instance-level alignments. Our proposed method\nenjoys several merits. First, our method can perform set-level alignment by\ndisentangling modality-specific and modality-invariant features. Compared with\nconventional methods, ours can explicitly remove the modality-specific features\nand the modality variation can be better reduced. Second, given cross-modality\nunpaired-images of a person, our method can generate cross-modality paired\nimages from exchanged images. With them, we can directly perform instance-level\nalignment by minimizing distances of every pair of images.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate a new way of identifying manoeuvres from vehicle telematics data,\nthrough motif detection in time-series. We implement a modified version of the\nExtended Motif Discovery (EMD) algorithm, a classical variable-length motif\ndetection algorithm for time-series and we applied it to the UAH-DriveSet, a\npublicly available naturalistic driving dataset. After a systematic exploration\nof the extracted motifs, we were able to conclude that the EMD algorithm was\nnot only capable of extracting simple manoeuvres such as accelerations, brakes\nand curves, but also more complex manoeuvres, such as lane changes and\novertaking manoeuvres, which validates motif discovery as a worthwhile line for\nfuture research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 23:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

The\ntimescales over which amorphous water ice is thermally transformed to\ncrystalline water ice at Europan surface temperatures suggests that the water\nice there should be primarily in the crystalline form, however, surface\nbombardment by charged particles induced by Jupiter's magnetic field, and vapor\ndeposition of water ice from Europan plumes, can produce amorphous water ice\nsurface deposits on short timescales. The purpose of this investigation is to\ndetermine whether the Europan surface water ice crystallinity derived from\nground-based spectroscopic measurements is in agreement with the crystallinity\nexpected based on temperature and radiation modeling. Using a 1D thermophysical\nmodel of Europa's surface, we calculate a full-disk crystallinity of Europa's\nleading hemisphere by incorporating the thermal relaxation of amorphous to\ncrystalline water ice and the degradation of crystalline to amorphous water ice\nby irradiation.

This discrepancy may be a\nresult of geophysical processes, such as by vapor-deposited plume material, or\nit may arise from assumptions and uncertainties in the crystallinity\ncalculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 23:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

This work introduces bispectral mode decomposition as a direct\nmeans of educing flow structures that are associated with triadic interactions\nfrom experimental or numerical data. Triadic interactions are characterized by\nquadratic phase coupling which can be detected by the bispectrum. The proposed\nmethod maximizes an integral measure of this third-order statistic to compute\nmodes associated with frequency triads, as well as a mode bispectrum that\nidentifies resonant three-wave interactions. Unlike the classical bispectrum,\nthe decomposition establishes a causal relationship between the three frequency\ncomponents of a triad. This permits the distinction of sum- and\ndifference-interactions, and the computation of interaction maps that indicate\nregions of nonlinear coupling. Three examples highlight different aspects of\nthe method. Cascading triads and their regions of interaction are educed from\ndirect numerical simulation data of laminar cylinder flow. It is further\ndemonstrated that linear instability mechanisms that attain an appreciable\namplitude are revealed indirectly by their difference-self-interactions.\nApplicability to turbulent flows and noise-rejection is demonstrated on\nparticle image velocimetry data of a massively separated wake.

We track the exact spread of these\ndisturbances in space and time by using the technique of quantum information\ncapsules (QIC). We find that the channel capacity between Alice and a receiver,\nBob, is enhanced by Bob placing detectors not only inside but in addition also\noutside the causal future of Alice's encoding operation. Intuitively, this type\nof superadditivity arises because the field outside the causal future of Alice\nis entangled with the field inside Alice's causal future. Hence, the quantum\nnoise picked up by Bob's detectors outside Alice's causal future is correlated\nwith the noise of Bob's detectors inside Alice's causal future. In effect, this\ncorrelation allows Bob to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of those of his\ndetectors which are in the causal future of Alice. Further, we develop the\nmultimode generalization of the QIC technique. This allows us to extend the\nanalysis to the case where Alice operates multiple localized and optionally\nentangled emitters.

The research on this topic is vast and still flourishing. One\nway to analyze the scaling properties of time series is through the estimation\nof their scaling exponents, that are recognized as being valuable measures to\ndiscriminate between random, persistent, and anti-persistent behaviors in these\ntime series. In the literature, several methods have been proposed to study the\nmultiscaling property. In this paper, we use the generalized Hurst exponent\n(GHE) tool and we propose a novel statistical procedure based on GHE which we\nname Relative Normalized and Standardized Generalized Hurst Exponent (RNSGHE).\nThis method is used to robustly estimate and test the multiscaling property\nand, together with a combination of t-tests and F-tests, serves to discriminate\nbetween real and spurious scaling. Furthermore, we introduce a new tool to\nestimate the optimal aggregation time used in our methodology which we name\nAutocororrelation Segmented Regression. We numerically validate this procedure\non simulated time series by using the Multifractal Random Walk (MRW) and we\nthen apply it to real financial data. We present results for times series with\nand without anomalies and we compute the bias that such anomalies introduce in\nthe measurement of the scaling exponents. We also show how the use of proper\nscaling and multiscaling can ameliorate the estimation of risk measures such as\nValue at Risk (VaR). Finally, we propose a methodology based on Monte Carlo\nsimulation, which we name Multiscaling Value at Risk (MSVaR), that takes into\naccount the statistical properties of multiscaling time series. We show that by\nusing this statistical procedure in combination with the robustly estimated\nmultiscaling exponents, the one year forecasted MSVaR mimics the VaR on the\nannual data for the majority of the stocks analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 01:50:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 15:49:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 19:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

Specifically, given a parametric model over the transition rates\nof a CTMC and some known transition rates, we wish to extrapolate its steady\nstate distribution to states that are unobserved. A technical roadblock to\nlearn a CTMC from its steady state has been that the chain rule to compute\ngradients will not work over the arbitrarily long sequences necessary to reach\nsteady state ---from where the aggregate statistics are sampled.

In this paper, we design an event detection algorithm that\ncombines textual, statistical and image information, following an unsupervised\nmachine learning approach. Specifically, the algorithm starts with semantic and\nstatistical analyses to obtain a list of tweet clusters, each of which\ncorresponds to an event candidate, and then performs image analysis to separate\nevents from non-events---a convolutional autoencoder is trained for each\ncluster as an anomaly detector, where a part of the images are used as the\ntraining data and the remaining images are used as the test instances.

In this paper, we construct an effective theory of the BOTP transition\nof two-dimensional (2D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model in a uniform magnetic\nfield. At $\\pi$ flux per plaquette, this model corresponds to the typical model\nof HOTIs proposed by Benalcazar, Bernevig, and Hughes (BBH). The BBH model can\nbe approximated by Dirac fermions with two kinds of mass terms, which will be\nreferred to as BBH Dirac insulator. To clarify the BOTP transition of the 2D\nSSH model around $\\pi$ flux, we study such BBH Dirac insulator in the presence\nof a magnetic field. On the other hand, generically in continuum Dirac models,\nboundary conditions associated with the Hermiticity of Hamiltonians are known\nto play a crucial role in determining the edge states.

Generally speaking, reverse engineering\naims to retrieve information from a product, i.e., integrated circuits (ICs)\nand printed circuit boards (PCBs) in hardware security-related scenarios, in\nthe hope of understanding the functionality of the device and determining its\nconstituent components. Hence, it can raise serious issues concerning\nIntellectual Property (IP) infringement, the (in)effectiveness of\nsecurity-related measures, and even new opportunities for injecting hardware\nTrojans. Ironically, reverse engineering can enable IP owners to verify and\nvalidate the design. Nevertheless, this cannot be achieved without overcoming\nnumerous obstacles that limit successful outcomes of the reverse engineering\nprocess. This paper surveys these challenges from two complementary\nperspectives: image processing and machine learning. These two fields of study\nform a firm basis for the enhancement of efficiency and accuracy of reverse\nengineering processes for both PCBs and ICs. In summary, therefore, this paper\npresents a roadmap indicating clearly the actions to be taken to fulfill\nhardware trust and assurance objectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 05:23:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 23:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-09"}

The other binary systems where jets might play significant\nroles include intermediate-luminosity optical transients (ILOTs), supernova\nimpostors (including pre-explosion outbursts), post-CEE binary systems,\npost-GEE binary systems, and progenitors of neutron star binary systems and\nblack hole binary systems. One of the immediate consequences is that the\noutflow of these systems is highly-non-spherical, including bipolar lobes,\njets, and rings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 06:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

In these systems,\nthe variability in power transmission is brought about by engaging and\ndisengaging the friction plates. Though commonly used, this method of making\nthe coupling noisy is not as versatile as their electrical analog. An\nalternative method would be to intermittently vary the frictional force. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate a self-organized way to tune the noise in the\nfrictional coupling between two surfaces which are in relative motion with each\nother. This is achieved by exploiting the complexity that arises from the\nfrictional interaction of the balls which are placed in a circular groove\nbetween the surfaces. The extent of floppiness in the coupling is related to\nthe rate at which the balls make transitions between their rolling and sliding\nstates. If the moving surface is soft and the static surface is hard we show\nthat with increasing filling fraction of the balls the transitions between\nrolling and sliding against the static surface give way to the transitions\nbetween rolling and sliding against the moving surface. As a consequence, the\nnoise in the coupling is large for both small and large filling fraction with a\ndip in the middle. In contrast, the sliding with the static surface is\nsuppressed if the moving pate is hard and the noise in the coupling decreases\nmonotonically with the filling fraction of the balls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 07:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

Recently, it has been shown\nthat unavoidable disorder in the environment is responsible for non-Markovian\neffects and information backflow from the environment into the system owing to\nAnderson localization. This~turns disorder into a resource for enhancing\nnon-Markovianity in the system--environment dynamics, which could be of\nrelevance in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here we consider the decoherence\ndynamics of a qubit weakly coupled to a two-dimensional bath with a nontrivial\ntopological phase, such as a two-level atom embedded in a two-dimensional\ncoupled-cavity array with a synthetic gauge field realizing a quantum-Hall\nbath, and~show that Markovianity is protected against moderate disorder owing\nto the robustness of chiral edge modes in the quantum-Hall bath. Interestingly,\nswitching off the gauge field, i.e., flipping the bath into a topological\ntrivial phase, allows one to re-introduce non-Markovian effects. Such a result\nindicates that changing the topological phase of a bath by a tunable synthetic\ngauge field can be harnessed to control non-Markovian effects and quantum\ninformation backflow in a qubit-environment system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 07:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

Unfortunately, under the framework of the \\sts model, direct\ndecoding from $\\log p(y|x) + \\log p(x|y)$ is infeasible since the second part\n(i.e., $p(x|y)$) requires the completion of target generation before it can be\ncomputed, and the search space for $y$ is enormous. Empirically, an N-best list\nis first generated given $p(y|x)$, and $p(x|y)$ is then used to rerank the\nN-best list, which inevitably results in non-globally-optimal solutions. In\nthis paper, we propose to use non-autoregressive (non-AR) generation model to\naddress this non-global optimality issue.

Great strides have been\nmade, with complex networks designed specifically to learn part-level\ndiscriminate feature representations. In this paper, we show it is possible to\ncultivate subtle details without the need for overly complicated network\ndesigns or training mechanisms -- a single loss is all it takes. The main trick\nlies with how we delve into individual feature channels early on, as opposed to\nthe convention of starting from a consolidated feature map. The proposed loss\nfunction, termed as mutual-channel loss (MC-Loss), consists of two\nchannel-specific components: a discriminality component and a diversity\ncomponent. The discriminality component forces all feature channels belonging\nto the same class to be discriminative, through a novel channel-wise attention\nmechanism. The diversity component additionally constraints channels so that\nthey become mutually exclusive on spatial-wise. The end result is therefore a\nset of feature channels that each reflects different locally discriminative\nregions for a specific class. The MC-Loss can be trained end-to-end, without\nthe need for any bounding-box/part annotations, and yields highly\ndiscriminative regions during inference. Experimental results show our MC-Loss\nwhen implemented on top of common base networks can achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on all four fine-grained categorization datasets (CUB-Birds,\nFGVC-Aircraft, Flowers-102, and Stanford-Cars).

Both types of regulators are\nbeneficial as they cancel the increase of burstiness due to multiplexing inside\nthe network. It was demonstrated, by using network calculus, that they do not\nincrease the worst-case latency. However, the properties of regulators were\nestablished assuming that time is perfect in all network nodes. In reality,\nnodes use local, imperfect clocks. Time-sensitive networks exist in two\nflavours: (1) in non-synchronized networks, local clocks run independently at\nevery node and their deviations are not controlled and (2) in synchronized\nnetworks, the deviations of local clocks are kept within very small bounds\nusing for example a synchronization protocol (such as PTP) or a satellite based\ngeo-positioning system (such as GPS).

The photon sphere as a three-dimensional hypersurface in\nspacetime is umbilic (its second quadratic form is pure trace).

The key idea\nfor the GLM approach is the separation of the Lagrangian (fluid) and Eulerian\n(wave) degrees of freedom in Hamilton's principle.

In contrast, WCI in the CL model\narises because the fluid velocity is defined relative to the frame of motion of\nthe Stokes mean drift velocity, which is usually taken to be prescribed, time\nindependent and driven externally. We compare the GLM and CL theories by\nplacing them both into the general framework of a stochastic Hamilton's\nprinciple for a 3D Euler--Boussinesq (EB) fluid in a rotating frame.

In\nparticular, we consider a non-linear dependence of the drag force on the\nrelative velocity between superfluid vortices and the normal component, in\nwhich the contributions of both kelvon and phonon excitations are included.\nThis non-linear model produces qualitatively new features, and is able to\nreproduce the observed bimodal distribution of glitch sizes in the pulsar\npopulation. The model also suggests that the differences in size distributions\nin individual pulsars may be due to the glitches being triggered in regions\nwith different pinning strengths, as stronger pinning leads to higher vortex\nvelocities and a qualitatively different mutual friction coupling with respect\nto the weak pinning case. Glitches in pulsars that appear to glitch\nquasi-periodically with similar sizes may thus be due to the same mechanisms as\nsmaller events in pulsars that have no preferred glitch size, but simply\noriginate in stronger pinning regions, possibly in the core of the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 11:04:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 12:31:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

In principle, neural networks (NNs) could\naccomplish this task since they can model non-linear feature interactions very\nwell. However, NNs require large amounts of training data to have a good\ngeneralization. In this paper we study the datastarved regime where a NN is\ntrained on a relatively small amount of training data. For that purpose we\nstudy feature selection for NNs, which is known to improve generalization for\nlinear models. As an extreme case of data with feature selection and feature\ninteractions we study the XOR-like data with irrelevant variables. We\nexperimentally observed that the cross-entropy loss function on XOR-like data\nhas many non-equivalent local optima, and the number of local optima grows\nexponentially with the number of irrelevant variables. To deal with the local\nminima and for feature selection we propose a node pruning and feature\nselection algorithm that improves the capability of NNs to find better local\nminima even when there are irrelevant variables.

However, there has been little discussion on the possibility\nthat individuals may use the above counterfactual explanations to invest effort\nstrategically and maximize their chances of receiving a beneficial decision. In\nthis paper, our goal is to find policies and counterfactual explanations that\nare optimal in terms of utility in such a strategic setting. We first show\nthat, given a pre-defined policy, the problem of finding the optimal set of\ncounterfactual explanations is NP-hard. Then, we show that the corresponding\nobjective is nondecreasing and satisfies submodularity and this allows a\nstandard greedy algorithm to enjoy approximation guarantees. In addition, we\nfurther show that the problem of jointly finding both the optimal policy and\nset of counterfactual explanations reduces to maximizing a non-monotone\nsubmodular function. As a result, we can use a recent randomized algorithm to\nsolve the problem, which also offers approximation guarantees. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that, by incorporating a matroid constraint into the problem\nformulation, we can increase the diversity of the optimal set of counterfactual\nexplanations and incentivize individuals across the whole spectrum of the\npopulation to self improve. Experiments on synthetic and real lending and\ncredit card data illustrate our theoretical findings and show that the\ncounterfactual explanations and decision policies found by our algorithms\nachieve higher utility than several competitive baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 12:04:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 11:28:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 16:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-15"}

The new approach is evaluated both\nqualitatively and quantitatively in simulation and real-world robot\nexperiments. The results show that the map-based end-to-end navigation model is\neasy to be deployed to a robotic platform, robust to sensor noise and\noutperforms other existing DRL-based models in many indicators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 12:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

This progress happened thanks to the rise of deep-learning and\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN) which allow to extract complex and abstract\nfeatures. However, edge detection and saliency are still two different fields\nand do not interact together, although it is intuitive for a human to detect\nsalient objects based on its boundaries. Those features are not well merged in\na CNN because edges and surfaces do not intersect since one feature represents\na region while the other represents boundaries between different regions. In\nthe current work, the main objective is to develop a method to merge the edges\nwith the saliency maps to improve the performance of the saliency. Hence, we\ndeveloped the gradient-domain merging (GDM) which can be used to quickly\ncombine the image-domain information of salient object detection with the\ngradient-domain information of the edge detection.

Moreover, these spin\ntextures can absorb other bimeron solitons or clusters along the translational\ndirection to acquire a wide range of N\\'eel topological numbers. The clustering\ninvolves the rearrangement of topological structures, and gives rise to\nremarkable changes in static and dynamical properties.

In this paper, we propose a load shedding\nstrategy for CEP systems which drops a portion of the CEP operator's internal\nstate (a.k.a. partial matches) to maintain a given latency bound. The crucial\nquestion here is how many and which partial matches to drop so that a given\nlatency bound is maintained while minimizing the degradation in the quality of\nresults. In the stream processing domain, different load shedding strategies\nhave been proposed that mainly depend on the importance of individual tuples.\nHowever, as CEP systems perform pattern detection, the importance of events is\nalso influenced by other events in the stream. Our load shedding strategy uses\nMarkov chain and Markov reward process to predict the utility/importance of\npartial matches to determine the ones to be dropped. In addition, we represent\nthe utility in a way that minimizes the overhead of load shedding. Furthermore,\nwe provide algorithms to decide when to start dropping partial matches and how\nmany partial matches to drop. By extensively evaluating our approach on three\nreal-world datasets and several representative queries, we show that the\nadverse impact of our load shedding strategy on the quality of results is\nconsiderably less than the impact of state-of-the-art load shedding strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 14:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

For the first time we conduct scale-free comparisons of feature\nimportance estimates across algorithms on ten real and synthetic data sets to\nstudy the similarities and differences of the resulting feature importance\nestimates, showing that SANs identify similar high-ranked features as the other\nmethods. We demonstrate that SANs identify feature interactions which in some\ncases yield better predictive performance than the baselines, suggesting that\nattention extends beyond interactions of just a few key features and detects\nlarger feature subsets relevant for the considered learning task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 15:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

Once trained, neural networks are computationally\ninexpensive to evaluate and remove the need for repeated evaluations of\ncomputationally expensive models in uncertainty quantification applications.\nHowever, given the highly parameterized construction of neural networks,\nespecially deep neural networks, accurate training often requires large amounts\nof simulation data that may not be available in the case of computationally\nexpensive systems. In this paper, to alleviate this issue for uncertainty\npropagation, we explore the application of transfer learning techniques using\ntraining data generated from both high- and low-fidelity models. We explore two\nstrategies for coupling these two datasets during the training procedure,\nnamely, the standard transfer learning and the bi-fidelity weighted learning.\nIn the former approach, a neural network model mapping the inputs to the\noutputs of interest is trained based on the low-fidelity data. The\nhigh-fidelity data is then used to adapt the parameters of the upper layer(s)\nof the low-fidelity network, or train a simpler neural network to map the\noutput of the low-fidelity network to that of the high-fidelity model. In the\nlatter approach, the entire low-fidelity network parameters are updated using\ndata generated via a Gaussian process model trained with a small high-fidelity\ndataset. The parameter updates are performed via a variant of stochastic\ngradient descent with learning rates given by the Gaussian process model. Using\nthree numerical examples, we illustrate the utility of these bi-fidelity\ntransfer learning methods where we focus on accuracy improvement achieved by\ntransfer learning over standard training approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 15:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

Furthermore, considering cases\nwhere computational realization of the knowledge-based component does not\nresolve subgrid-scale processes, our scheme is able to use training data to\nincorporate the effect of the unresolved short-scale dynamics upon the resolved\nlonger-scale dynamics (\"subgrid-scale closure\").\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 23:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

The presence of Fermi surface leads to stabilization of such states in\nits vicinity and a possibility of their Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). The\ntheory provides a natural explanation of the existence of a pseudogap phase\npreceding the superconductivity and enables one to estimate the temperature of\na transition $T^*$ from a normal state to a pseudogap one. It is shown that the\ntemperature of BEC of TI bipolarons determines the temperature of a\nsuperconducting transition $T_c$ which depends not on the bipolaron effective\nmass but on the ordinary mass of a band electron. This removes restrictions on\nthe upper limit of $T_c$ for a strong electron-phonon interaction.

Field\nequations for the first-order equivalent medium are derived and overall\nconstitutive tensors are obtained in closed form. These lasts depend upon the\nmicro constitutive properties of the different phases composing the composite\nmaterial and upon periodic perturbation functions, which allow taking into\naccount the effects of microstructural heterogeneities. Perturbation functions\nare determined as solutions of recursive non homogeneous cell problems emanated\nfrom the substitution of asymptotic expansions of the micro fields in powers of\nthe microstructural characteristic size into local balance equations. Average\nfield equations of infinite order are also provided, whose formal solution can\nbe obtained through asymptotic expansions of the macrofields. With the aim of\ninvestigating dispersion properties of waves propagating inside the medium,\nproper integral transforms are applied to governing field equations of the\nhomogenized medium. A quadratic generalized eigenvalue problem is thus\nobtained, whose solution characterizes the complex valued frequency band\nstructure of the first-order equivalent material. The validity of the proposed\ntechnique has been confirmed by the very good matching obtained between\ndispersion curves of the homogenized medium and the lowest frequency ones\nrelative to the heterogeneous material. These lasts are computed from the\nresolution of a quadratic generalized eigenvalue problem over the periodic cell\nsubjected to Floquet-Bloch boundary conditions.
