Here we examine the impurity\nparticle flux in a number of approximately quasisymmetric stellarator\nconfigurations and parameter regimes while varying the amount of\nsymmetry-breaking in the magnetic field. The amount of symmetry-breaking (from\nperfect quasisymmetry) required to lose temperature screening is dependent on\nthe particular configuration and flux surface.

A further look at\nthese fluxes when compared to a gyro-Bohm turbulence estimate suggests that\nneoclassical fluxes are small in optimized configurations compared to turbulent\nfluxes. Therefore, although neoclassical impurity accumulation is expected in\nmost situations, the strength of the turbulence may render this irrelevant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2020 16:57:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Nevertheless, the challenging\nproblem of estimating the BTD model structure, namely the number of block terms\nand their individual ranks, has only recently started to attract significant\nattention. In this paper, a novel method of BTD model selection and computation\nis proposed, based on the idea of imposing column sparsity \\emph{jointly} on\nthe factors and in a \\emph{hierarchical} manner and estimating the ranks as the\nnumbers of factor columns of non-negligible magnitude.

The universal logarithmic velocity profile in\nwall-bounded turbulent flows proposed by von K\\'arm\\'an in 1930 is one of the\nfew exact physical descriptions of turbulence. However, the mean velocity and\ntemperature profiles cannot be adequately described by this universal log law\nwhen buoyancy effects are present. Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST),\nproposed in 1954, has been the cornerstone theory to account for these buoyancy\neffects and to describe the atmospheric boundary layer. MOST has been used in\nalmost all global weather, climate and hydrological models to describe the\ndependence of the mean velocity, temperature and scalar profiles on buoyancy.\nAccording to MOST, the logarithmic temperature profile breaks down as buoyancy\neffects become important. In contrast, here we show that this long-standing\nMOST theory does not apply for temperature.

This work is motivated by the observation that classical\noptimal power flow (OPF) formulations used for economic optimization might\nprovide equilibria that are not reachable by low-level controllers (i.e.,\nclosed-loop unstable). This arises because OPF problems only enforce\nsteady-state conditions and do not capture the dynamics. We explain this\nbehavior by using a port-Hamiltonian microgrid representation. To overcome the\nlimitations of OPF, the port-Hamiltonian representation can be exploited to\nderive a bilevel OPF formulation that seeks to optimize economics while\nenforcing stability. Unfortunately, bilevel optimization with a nonconvex inner\nproblem is difficult to solve in general. As such, we propose an alternative\napproach (that we call probing OPF), which identifies an economic-optimal and\nstable equilibrium by probing a neighborhood of equilibria using random\nperturbations. The probing OPF is advantageous in that it is formulated as a\nstandard nonlinear program, in that it is compatible with existing OPF\nframeworks, and in that it is applicable to diverse microgrid models.\nExperiments with the IEEE 118-bus system reveal that few probing points are\nrequired to enforce stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2020 00:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

A new\nresampling technique of independent interest is introduced and analyzed: it\nserves as an alternative to the well-known multiplier bootstrap, significantly\nreducing computational complexity of bootstrap-based methods. We provide\ntheoretical guarantees for the type-I error of our procedures, which remarkably\nimprove the previously obtained results in the field. Moreover, we analyze\npower of our tests.

In\nthis paper, we investigate the role of the dataset quality by studying the\nimpact of dataset size and the label noise on the model confidence. We\ntheoretically explain and experimentally demonstrate that, surprisingly, label\nnoise in the training data leads to under-confident networks, while reduced\ndataset size leads to over-confident models.

A\nfundamental problem is to quantify their similarities. Graph kernels are often\nused for this purpose, which decompose graphs into substructures and compare\nthese substructures. However, most of the existing graph kernels do not have\nthe property of scale-adaptivity, i.e., they cannot compare graphs at multiple\nlevels of granularities. Many real-world graphs such as molecules exhibit\nstructure at varying levels of granularities. To tackle this problem, we\npropose a new graph kernel called Tree++ in this paper. At the heart of Tree++\nis a graph kernel called the path-pattern graph kernel.

In this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork (WSN), where a multi-antenna UAV is dispatched to collect data from a\ngroup of sensor nodes (SNs). The objective is to maximize the minimum data\ncollection rate from all SNs via jointly optimizing their transmission\nscheduling and power allocations as well as the trajectory of the UAV, subject\nto the practical constraints on the maximum transmit power of the SNs and the\nmaximum speed of the UAV. The formulated optimization problem is challenging to\nsolve as it involves non-convex constraints and discrete-value variables. To\ndraw useful insight, we first consider the special case of the formulated\nproblem by ignoring the UAV speed constraint and optimally solve it based on\nthe Lagrange duality method. It is shown that for this relaxed problem, the UAV\nshould hover above a finite number of optimal locations with different\ndurations in general.

We show that using the\ndiscriminative update instead of standard generative models results in\nsignificantly improved performance, especially for tasks with complex visual\nobservations, because they circumvent the difficulty of modeling complex\nobservations that are irrelevant to decision making. In addition, to extract\nfeatures from the particle belief, we propose a new type of belief feature\nbased on the moment generating function. DPFRL outperforms state-of-the-art\nPOMDP RL models in Flickering Atari Games, an existing POMDP RL benchmark, and\nin Natural Flickering Atari Games, a new, more challenging POMDP RL benchmark\nintroduced in this paper. Further, DPFRL performs well for visual navigation\nwith real-world data in the Habitat environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2020 11:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

The measurement is based\non data collected at the CMS experiment at $\\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV, corresponding\nto an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$. The observed significance of the\nsignal is 3.9 standard deviations, where a significance of 5.2 standard\ndeviations is expected in the standard model. These results are combined with\npublished results by CMS at $\\sqrt{s} =$ 8 TeV, which leads to observed and\nexpected respective significances of 4.7 and 5.5 standard deviations. From the\n13 TeV data, a value is obtained for the signal strength of electroweak\nZ$\\gamma$jj production and bounds are given on quartic vector boson\ninteractions in the framework of dimension-eight effective field theory\noperators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2020 13:33:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 17:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

Different from the old interpretation, it\nwas shown that the shifts demand two coupled spin components with different\ntemperature dependencies. One spin component couples isotropically to the\nplanar Cu nucleus and is likely to reside at planar O, while the other,\nanisotropic component has its origin in the planar copper $3d(x^2-y^2)$\norbital. Nuclear relaxation, on the other hand, was found to be rather\nubiquitous and Fermi liquid-like for planar Cu, i.e., it is independent of\ndoping and material, apart from the sudden drop at the superconducting\ntransition temperature, $T_{\\rm c}$. However, there is a doping and material\ndependent anisotropy that is independent on temperature, above and below\n$T_{\\rm c}$. Here we present a slightly different analysis of the shifts that\nfits all planar Cu shift data. In addition we are able to derive a simple model\nthat explains nuclear relaxation based on these two spin components. In\nparticular, the only outlier so far, \\lsco, can be understood, as well.

The fragments are stable graphenous molecules, which are the\nbasic structural units (BSUs) of the solids, determining them as amorphics with\nmolecular structure. Due to weak intermolecular interaction, BSUs, once\naggregated, are the main defendants for IR absorption and Raman scattering of\nthe solids, just justifying the consideration of them at molecular level. The\nstandard G-D-2D pattern of Raman spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,\n$^2$ amorphous carbons, graphene and/or graphite crystal is attributed to\nextended honeycomb composition of carbon atoms and are suggested as\nmanifestation of molecule-crystal dualism of graphenous materials.

In this paper, we extend the earlier work to\nroute circuits that implement QAOA for Graph Coloring problems. QAOA for\ncoloring requires execution of more, and more complex, operations on the chip,\nwhich makes routing a more challenging problem. We evaluate the approach on\nstate-of-the-art hardware architectures from leading quantum computing\ncompanies. Additionally, we apply a planning approach to qubit initialization.\nOur empirical evaluation shows that temporal planning compares well to\nreasonable analytic upper bounds, and that solving qubit initialization with a\nclassical planner generally helps temporal planners in finding shorter-makespan\ncompilations for QAOA for Graph Coloring. These advances suggest that temporal\nplanning can be an effective approach for more complex quantum computing\nalgorithms and architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2020 03:09:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

We provide\nan algorithm achieving bdArc-Consistency for a TCSP, which we will refer to as\nbdAC-3, for it is an adaptation of Mackworth's [1977] well-known\narc-consistency algorithm AC-3. We show that if a convex TCSP, referred to in\n[Dechter et al., 1991] as an STP (Simple Temporal Problem), is\nbdArc-Consistent, and its \"origin of the world\" variable disconnected from none\nof the other variables, its binarized domains are minimal. We provide two\npolynomial backtrack-free procedures: one for the task of getting, from a\nbdArc-Consistent STP, either that it is inconsistent or, in case of\nconsistency, a bdArc-Consistent STP refinement whose \"origin of the world\"\nvariable is disconnected from none of the other variables; the other for the\ntask of getting a solution from a bdArc-Consistent STP whose \"origin of the\nworld\" variable is disconnected from none of the other variables. We then show\nhow to use our results both in a general TCSP solver and in a TCSP-based job\nshop scheduler. From our work can be extracted a one-to-all all-to-one shortest\npaths algorithm of an IR-labelled directed graph. Finally, we show that an\nexisting adaptation to TCSPs of Mackworth's [1977] path-consistency algorithm\nPC-2 is not guaranteed to always terminate, and correct it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2020 18:15:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 16:40:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}
