This is the\ncase for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic\nimaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and\nthe basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple\nmathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously\nmodels how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the\npresence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we\nanalyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the\nmathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that\nthis imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a\ngeometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm\nthat incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical\nimplementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2020 16:03:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 05:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

Instead of focusing on the techniques themselves, this paper\nleverages alternative data sources to enhance both statistical and economic\nmodel performance. The study demonstrates how including call networks, in the\ncontext of positive credit information, as a new Big Data source has added\nvalue in terms of profit by applying a profit measure and profit-based feature\nselection. A unique combination of datasets, including call-detail records,\ncredit and debit account information of customers is used to create scorecards\nfor credit card applicants. Call-detail records are used to build call networks\nand advanced social network analytics techniques are applied to propagate\ninfluence from prior defaulters throughout the network to produce influence\nscores. The results show that combining call-detail records with traditional\ndata in credit scoring models significantly increases their performance when\nmeasured in AUC. In terms of profit, the best model is the one built with only\ncalling behavior features. In addition, the calling behavior features are the\nmost predictive in other models, both in terms of statistical and economic\nperformance. The results have an impact in terms of ethical use of call-detail\nrecords, regulatory implications, financial inclusion, as well as data sharing\nand privacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2020 16:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-20"}

The ridge, which is\ninterpreted to be an inverted channel, exhibits a history of sedimentary,\nevaporitic, and diagenetic origin that includes groundwater mobilization and\nprecipitation of anhydrite cements throughout the volume of the ridge. The\nridge consists of two units: a lower one exhibiting a sedimentary and\ndiagenetic history, and an upper one exhibiting an evaporitic history.\nInterbedded in the section are also anhydritic and gypsic paleosols. Two\nmechanisms that contribute to channel preservation and inversion are identified\nin this case.

The\nslope-conforming armor formed by this second mechanism developed subsequent to\nthe formation of the ridge as a consequence of the remobilization of soluble\nsalts.

The plates exhibit a reticulated surface\ntexture, which we interpret as the result of periodic deliquescence and\nreprecipitation of a thin surface film of the evaporite deposits in response to\nthick morning fogs that occur in this part of the Atacama. The cross section of\nthe plates exhibits a thin portion of biological material, which we ascribe to\nbacterial mats that take advantage of the deliquescence of the substrate to\nobtain their water.

In this paper, we present a new family of de-randomized PAC-Bayes\nmargin bounds for deterministic non-convex and non-smooth predictors, e.g.,\nReLU-nets. Unlike PAC-Bayes, which applies to Bayesian predictors, the\nde-randomized bounds apply to deterministic predictors like ReLU-nets. A\nspecific instantiation of the bound depends on a trade-off between the\n(weighted) distance of the trained weights from the initialization and the\neffective curvature (`flatness') of the trained predictor.\n  To get to these bounds, we first develop a de-randomization argument for\nnon-convex but smooth predictors, e.g., linear deep networks (LDNs), which\nconnects the performance of the deterministic predictor with a Bayesian\npredictor. We then consider non-smooth predictors which for any given input\nrealized as a smooth predictor, e.g., ReLU-nets become some LDNs for any given\ninput, but the realized smooth predictors can be different for different\ninputs. For such non-smooth predictors, we introduce a new PAC-Bayes analysis\nwhich takes advantage of the smoothness of the realized predictors, e.g., LDN,\nfor a given input, and avoids dependency on the Lipschitz constant of the\nnon-smooth predictor. After careful de-randomization, we get a bound for the\ndeterministic non-smooth predictor. We also establish non-uniform sample\ncomplexity results based on such bounds. Finally, we present extensive\nempirical results of our bounds over changing training set size and randomness\nin labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2020 17:54:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 06:56:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 01:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

There is generally a\ntradeoff between the two, as fine-tuning of the decision boundary of a\nclassification model to accommodate more boundary training samples (i.e.,\nhigher model complexity) may improve training accuracy (i.e., lower bias) but\nhurt generalization against unseen data (i.e., higher variance). By focusing on\njust classification boundary fine-tuning and model complexity, it is difficult\nto reduce both bias and variance. To overcome this dilemma, we take a different\nperspective and investigate a new approach to handle inaccuracy and uncertainty\nin the training data labels, which are inevitable in many applications where\nlabels are conceptual and labeling is performed by human annotators. The\nprocess of classification can be undermined by uncertainty in the labels of the\ntraining data; extending a boundary to accommodate an inaccurately labeled\npoint will increase both bias and variance. Our novel method can reduce both\nbias and variance by estimating the pointwise label uncertainty of the training\nset and accordingly adjusting the training sample weights such that those\nsamples with high uncertainty are weighted down and those with low uncertainty\nare weighted up. In this way, uncertain samples have a smaller contribution to\nthe objective function of the model's learning algorithm and exert less pull on\nthe decision boundary.

This dataset consists of multiple response types (e.g.,\ncontinuous-valued, count-valued, binomial counts). Thus, we introduce a\nreasonable easy-to-implement all-purpose method that \"converts\" a statistical\nmodel for continuous responses (the preferred model) into a Bayesian model for\nmulti-response data sets. To do this, we transform the data such that the\ncontinuous-valued transformed data can be reasonably modeled using the\npreferred model and the transformation itself is treated as unknown. The\nimplementation of our approach involves two steps. The first step produces\nposterior replicates of the transformed data using a latent conjugate\nmultivariate (LCM) model. The second step involves generating values from the\nposterior distribution implied by the preferred model. We refer to our model as\nthe hierarchical generalized transformation (HGT) model. In a simulation, we\ndemonstrate the flexibility of the HGT model by incorporating two different\npreferred models: Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) and the spatial\nmixed effects (spatio-temporal mixed effects) models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2020 20:43:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 15:00:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2020 00:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

In this context the Maurer-Cartan equation of the L$_\\infty$ algebra\ncan be viewed as a generalization of the Braverman-Gaitsgory criterion for\nPoincar\\'e-Birkhoff-Witt deformations of Koszul algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2020 22:31:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 08:43:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 22:08:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 09:22:59 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2023 21:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

The $B-V$ color has got redder from\n0.$^{m}4$ in 2000 to 0.$^{m}7$ in 2019, whereas the $U-B$ color has not changed\nsignificantly. New $JHKL$ photometry was obtained in 2019.

The long-term brightness variations are due\nmostly to the changing input of emission lines to the integral light.\nLow-dispersion spectroscopic observations carried out in 2010-2019 revealed a\ncontinuing decrease in the $\\lambda4363/\\lambda4340$ ratio: it decreased by a\nfactor of $\\sim3$ in 30 years and reached the level of 1960-1970.

The outcomes of the decision problems depend on the state of\nthe world that is unknown to the buyers. The buyers can make their own\nobservations and thus can hold different personal beliefs about the state of\nthe world. There is an information seller who has access to the state of the\nworld.

A major driving\nforce behind this effort is the possibility to study strong-field vacuum\nbreakdown and an accompanying electron-positron pair plasma via a quantum\nelectrodynamic (QED) cascade [Edwin Cartlidge, \"The light fantastic\", Science\n359, 382 (2018)]. Whereas Europe is focusing on all-optical 10 PW-class laser\nfacilities (e.g., Apollon and ELI), China is already planning on co-locating a\n100 PW laser system with a 25 keV superconducting XFEL and thus implicitly also\na high-quality electron beam [Station of Extreme Light (SEL) at the Shanghai\nSuperintense-Ultrafast Lasers Facility (SULF)]. This white paper elucidates the\nseminal scientific opportunities facilitated by colliding dense, multi-GeV\nelectron beams with multi-PW optical laser pulses.

In this paper, we propose to\nmodel the user mobility pattern and utility of the LBS as a Markov decision\nprocess (MDP), and inspired by probabilistic current state opacity notation, we\nintroduce a new location privacy metric, namely $\\epsilon-$privacy, that\nquantifies the adversary belief over the user's current location.

Emosaic is grounded in psychological research on the\nrelationship between language, affect, and color perception. We capitalize on\nan established three-dimensional model of human emotion: valence (good, nice\nvs. bad, awful), arousal (calm, passive vs. exciting, active) and dominance\n(weak, controlled vs. strong, in control). Previously, multi-dimensional models\nof emotion have been used rarely in visualizations of textual data, due to the\nperceptual challenges involved. Furthermore, until recently most text\nvisualizations remained at a high level, precluding closer engagement with the\ndeep semantic content of the text. Informed by empirical studies, we introduce\na color mapping that translates any point in three-dimensional affective space\ninto a unique color. Emosaic uses affective dictionaries of words annotated\nwith the three emotional parameters of the valence-arousal-dominance model to\nextract emotional meanings from texts and then assigns to them corresponding\ncolor parameters of the hue-saturation-brightness color space. This approach of\nmapping emotion to color is aimed at helping readers to more easily grasp the\nemotional tone of the text. Several features of Emosaic allow readers to\ninteractively explore the affective content of the text in more detail; e.g.,\nin aggregated form as histograms, in sequential form following the order of\ntext, and in detail embedded into the text display itself.

For\nmixtures containing species with large differences in atomic number Z, the\nmodeling needs to consider at the same time the kinetic theory for low-Z\nelements combined with the theory of strongly coupled plasma for high-Z\nelements, as well as all the intermediate situations that can appear in\nmulti-component systems. For such cases, we study the pair distribution\nfunctions, self-diffusions, mutual diffusion and viscosity for ternary mixtures\nat extreme conditions. These quantities can be produced from first principles\nusing orbital free molecular dynamics at the computational expense of very\nintensive simulations to reach good statistics. Utilizing the first-principles\nresults as reference data, we assess the merit of a global analytic model for\ntransport coefficients, Pseudo-Ions in Jellium (PIJ), based on an\niso-electronic assumption ( iso-n e ). With a multi-component hypernetted-chain\nintegral equation, we verify the quality of the iso-n e prescription for\ndescribing the static structure of the mixtures. This semi-analytical modeling\ncompares well with the simulation results and allows one to consider plasma\nmixtures not accessible to simulations. Applications are given for the mix of\nmaterials in ICF experiments. A reduction of a multicomponent mixture to an\neffective binary mixture is also established in the hydrodynamic limit and\ncompared with PIJ estimations for ICF relevant mixtures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 07:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-19"}

However, existing\nschedulers do not consider the communication contention of multiple\ncommunication tasks from different distributed training jobs, which could\ndeteriorate the system performance and prolong the job completion time. In this\npaper, we first establish a new DDL job scheduling framework which organizes\nDDL jobs as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and considers communication\ncontention between nodes. We then propose an efficient algorithm, LWF-$\\kappa$,\nto balance the GPU utilization and consolidate the allocated GPUs for each job.\nWhen scheduling those communication tasks, we observe that neither avoiding all\nthe contention nor blindly accepting them is optimal to minimize the job\ncompletion time. We thus propose a provable algorithm, AdaDUAL, to efficiently\nschedule those communication tasks. Based on AdaDUAL, we finally propose\nAda-SRSF for the DDL job scheduling problem. Simulations on a 64-GPU cluster\nconnected with 10 Gbps Ethernet show that LWF-$\\kappa$ achieves up to\n$1.59\\times$ improvement over the classical first-fit algorithms.

Approximate Bayesian inference has been empirically\ndemonstrated to improve predictive uncertainty in neural networks, although the\ntheoretical analysis of such Bayesian approximations is limited. We\ntheoretically analyze approximate Gaussian distributions on the weights of ReLU\nnetworks and show that they fix the overconfidence problem.

However,\nmost existing talking face video generation methods only consider facial\nanimation with fixed head pose. In this paper, we address this problem by\nproposing a deep neural network model that takes an audio signal A of a source\nperson and a very short video V of a target person as input, and outputs a\nsynthesized high-quality talking face video with personalized head pose (making\nuse of the visual information in V), expression and lip synchronization (by\nconsidering both A and V). The most challenging issue in our work is that\nnatural poses often cause in-plane and out-of-plane head rotations, which makes\nsynthesized talking face video far from realistic. To address this challenge,\nwe reconstruct 3D face animation and re-render it into synthesized frames. To\nfine tune these frames into realistic ones with smooth background transition,\nwe propose a novel memory-augmented GAN module. By first training a general\nmapping based on a publicly available dataset and fine-tuning the mapping using\nthe input short video of target person, we develop an effective strategy that\nonly requires a small number of frames (about 300 frames) to learn personalized\ntalking behavior including head pose. Extensive experiments and two user\nstudies show that our method can generate high-quality (i.e., personalized head\nmovements, expressions and good lip synchronization) talking face videos, which\nare naturally looking with more distinguishing head movement effects than the\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 10:02:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 10:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-06"}

We study the\nfully dynamic version of the problem in which the graph is undergoing edge\ninsertions and deletions and we wish to maintain a vertex-coloring with small\nupdate time after each insertion and deletion.\n  We show how to maintain an $O(\\alpha \\lg n)$-coloring with polylogarithmic\nupdate time, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph and $\\alpha$ is\nthe current arboricity of the graph. This improves upon a result by Solomon and\nWein (ESA'18) who maintained an $O(\\alpha_{\\max}\\lg^2 n)$-coloring, where\n$\\alpha_{\\max}$ is the maximum arboricity of the graph over all updates.\n  Furthermore, motivated by a lower bound by Barba et al.

Barba et al. showed that\ndynamic algorithms with polylogarithmic update time cannot maintain an\n$f(\\alpha)$-coloring for any function $f$ when the vertex colors are stored\nexplicitly, i.e., for each vertex the color is stored explicitly in the memory.\nPreviously, all dynamic algorithms maintained explicit colorings. Therefore, we\npropose to study implicit colorings, i.e., the data structure only needs to\noffer an efficient query procedure to return the color of a vertex (instead of\nstoring its color explicitly). We provide an algorithm which breaks the lower\nbound and maintains an implicit $2^{O(\\alpha)}$-coloring with polylogarithmic\nupdate time. In particular, this yields the first dynamic $O(1)$-coloring for\ngraphs with constant arboricity such as planar graphs or graphs with bounded\ntree-width, which is impossible using explicit colorings.\n  We also show how to dynamically maintain a partition of the graph's edges\ninto $O(\\alpha)$ forests with polylogarithmic update time.

While\ndedicated accelerators provide high energy efficiency, they are\nover-specialized and hard to adjust to algorithmic changes. We propose an\narchitectural concept that tackles the issues of achieving extreme energy\nefficiency while still maintaining high flexibility as a general-purpose\ncompute engine. The key idea is to pair a tiny 10kGE control core, called\nSnitch, with a double-precision FPU to adjust the compute to control ratio.\nWhile traditionally minimizing non-FPU area and achieving high floating-point\nutilization has been a trade-off, with Snitch, we achieve them both, by\nenhancing the ISA with two minimally intrusive extensions: stream semantic\nregisters (SSR) and a floating-point repetition instruction (FREP). SSRs allow\nthe core to implicitly encode load/store instructions as register reads/writes,\neliding many explicit memory instructions. The FREP extension decouples the\nfloating-point and integer pipeline by sequencing instructions from a\nmicro-loop buffer. These ISA extensions significantly reduce the pressure on\nthe core and free it up for other tasks, making Snitch and FPU effectively\ndual-issue at a minimal incremental cost of 3.2%. The two low overhead ISA\nextensions make Snitch more flexible than a contemporary vector processor lane,\nachieving a $2\\times$ energy-efficiency improvement. We have evaluated the\nproposed core and ISA extensions on an octa-core cluster in 22nm technology.

A revisited algorithm is shown and applied by\ninjecting a fraction of adversarial samples during the training phase.\nNumerical experiments have been conducted using a specific CNN model for\nillustration although our study could be applied to other models - not only CNN\nones - and in other contexts - not only redshift measurements - as it deals\nwith the complexity of the boundary decision surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 10:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

A number of approaches have been\nproposed to address this issue by constraining the discriminator's capabilities\nusing empirical techniques, like weight clipping, gradient penalty, spectral\nnormalization etc. In this paper, we provide a more principled approach as an\nalternative solution to this issue. Instead of training the discriminator to\ndistinguish real and fake input samples, we investigate the relationship\nbetween paired samples by training the discriminator to separate paired samples\nfrom the same distribution and those from different distributions. To this end,\nwe explore a relation network architecture for the discriminator and design a\ntriplet loss which performs better generalization and stability.

However, existing methods are\nstill challenged by the training inefficiency and labor cost in pruning\ndesigns, due to missing theoretical guidance of non-salient network components.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel filter pruning method by exploring the High\nRank of feature maps (HRank). Our HRank is inspired by the discovery that the\naverage rank of multiple feature maps generated by a single filter is always\nthe same, regardless of the number of image batches CNNs receive. Based on\nHRank, we develop a method that is mathematically formulated to prune filters\nwith low-rank feature maps. The principle behind our pruning is that low-rank\nfeature maps contain less information, and thus pruned results can be easily\nreproduced. Besides, we experimentally show that weights with high-rank feature\nmaps contain more important information, such that even when a portion is not\nupdated, very little damage would be done to the model performance. Without\nintroducing any additional constraints, HRank leads to significant improvements\nover the state-of-the-arts in terms of FLOPs and parameters reduction, with\nsimilar accuracies. For example, with ResNet-110, we achieve a 58.2%-FLOPs\nreduction by removing 59.2% of the parameters, with only a small loss of 0.14%\nin top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10. With Res-50, we achieve a 43.8%-FLOPs reduction\nby removing 36.7% of the parameters, with only a loss of 1.17% in the top-1\naccuracy on ImageNet.

However, the\nencapsulation poses several questions, namely, how it affects, via the weak van\nder Waals forces, the properties of the black phosphorus and whether these\nproperties can be tuned on demand. Prompted by these questions, we have\ninvestigated the impact of hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation on the\nstructural and vibrational properties of few layer black phosphorus, using a\nfirst-principles method in the framework of density functional theory. We\ndemonstrate that the encapsulation with hexagonal boron nitride imposes biaxial\nstrain on the black phosphorus material, flattening its puckered structure, by\ndecreasing the thickness of the layers via the increase of the puckered angle\nand the intra-layer P-P bonds. This work exemplifies the evolution of\nstructural parameters in layered materials after the encapsulation process. We\nfind that after encapsulation, phosphorene (single layer black phosphorous)\ncontracts by 1.1% in the armchair direction and stretches by 1.3% in the zigzag\ndirection, whereas few layer black phosphorus mainly expands by up to 3% in the\narmchair direction. However, these relatively small strains induced by the\nhexagonal BN, lead to significant changes in the vibrational properties of\nblack phosphorus, with the redshifts of up to 10 cm$^{-1}$ of the high\nfrequency optical mode $A_g^1$. In general, structural changes induced by the\nencapsulation process open the door to substrate controlled strain engineering\nin two-dimensional crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 11:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

A search result, called a semantic association (SA), is typically a\ncompact (e.g., diameter-constrained) connected subgraph containing all the\nquery entities. For this problem of SA search, efficient algorithms exist but\nwill return empty results if some query entities are distant in the graph. To\nreduce the occurrence of failing query and provide alternative results, we\nstudy the problem of query relaxation in the context of SA search. Simply\nrelaxing the compactness constraint will sacrifice the compactness of an SA,\nand more importantly, may lead to performance issues and be impracticable.\nInstead, we focus on removing the smallest number of entities from the original\nfailing query, to form a maximum successful sub-query which minimizes the loss\nof result quality caused by relaxation. We prove that verifying the success of\na sub-query turns into finding an entity (called a certificate) that satisfies\na distance-based condition about the query entities. To efficiently find a\ncertificate of the success of a maximum sub-query, we propose a best-first\nsearch algorithm that leverages distance-based estimation to effectively prune\nthe search space. We further improve its performance by adding two fine-grained\nheuristics: one based on degree and the other based on distance.

Since there is\nnot a large sample of FRBs with identified redshifts, we use simulated FRBs\ninstead. Through various simulations, we show that this methodology works well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 12:11:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 16:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 16:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

High\nfidelity transmission of optical vortices in untwisted SR-PCF becomes more and\nmore difficult as the orbital angular momentum (OAM) order increases, due to\nscattering at structural imperfections in the fiber microstructure.

Most approaches address this\ndifficulty by learning discriminative representation of individual input image.\nOn the other hand, humans can effectively identify contrastive clues by\ncomparing image pairs. Inspired by this fact, this paper proposes a simple but\neffective Attentive Pairwise Interaction Network (API-Net), which can\nprogressively recognize a pair of fine-grained images by interaction.\nSpecifically, API-Net first learns a mutual feature vector to capture semantic\ndifferences in the input pair. It then compares this mutual vector with\nindividual vectors to generate gates for each input image. These distinct gate\nvectors inherit mutual context on semantic differences, which allow API-Net to\nattentively capture contrastive clues by pairwise interaction between two\nimages. Additionally, we train API-Net in an end-to-end manner with a score\nranking regularization, which can further generalize API-Net by taking feature\npriorities into account.

The H2CO and CS emission from\nthe inner 200 au is mostly from the disk and their morphology is very similar.\nThe CN emission significantly differs from the other two molecules as it is\nobserved only beyond 150 au.

The method is hybrid in the sense\nthat a convergent backstop method is invoked if the timestep becomes too small,\nor to prevent solutions from overshooting zero and becoming negative. Under\nparameter constraints that imply Feller's condition, we prove that such a\nscheme is strongly convergent, of order at least 1/2. Control of the strong\nerror is important for multi-level Monte Carlo techniques.

The absence of metals is expected to\nprevent gas from efficient cooling and fragmentation in theory. However, this\neffect has not yet been observed at low metallicity environments, such as in\nthe early Universe and local dwarf galaxies, because of the lack of high\nspatial resolution maps of gas. We carried out ALMA observations of the carbon\nmonoxide (CO) J=2-1 emission line at 1.4-parsec resolutions of a molecular\ncloud in DDO 70 at 7% solar metallicity, the most metal-poor galaxy currently\nknown with a CO detection. In total, five clumps have been identified and they\nare found to follow more or less the Larson's law. Since the CO emission exists\nin regions with visual extinction A_V around 1.0, we converted this A_V to the\ngas mass surface density using a gas-to-dust ratio of 4,594+-2,848 for DDO 70.\nWe found that the CO clumps in DDO 70 exhibit significantly larger (on average\nfour times) sizes than those at the same gas mass surface densities in massive\nstar-formation regions of the Milky Way. The existence of such large clumps\nappears to be consistent with theoretical expectations that gas fragmentation\nin low metallicity clouds is suppressed.

To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel\ndeep neural network based method, called PUGeo-Net, that learns a $3\\times 3$\nlinear transformation matrix $\\bf T$ for each input point. Matrix $\\mathbf T$\napproximates the augmented Jacobian matrix of a local parameterization and\nbuilds a one-to-one correspondence between the 2D parametric domain and the 3D\ntangent plane so that we can lift the adaptively distributed 2D samples (which\nare also learned from data) to 3D space. After that, we project the samples to\nthe curved surface by computing a displacement along the normal of the tangent\nplane. PUGeo-Net is fundamentally different from the existing deep learning\nmethods that are largely motivated by the image super-resolution techniques and\ngenerate new points in the abstract feature space. Thanks to its\ngeometry-centric nature, PUGeo-Net works well for both CAD models with sharp\nfeatures and scanned models with rich geometric details. Moreover, PUGeo-Net\ncan compute the normal for the original and generated points, which is highly\ndesired by the surface reconstruction algorithms. Computational results show\nthat PUGeo-Net, the first neural network that can jointly generate vertex\ncoordinates and normals, consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms\nof accuracy and efficiency for upsampling factor $4\\sim 16$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 14:13:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2020 16:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

Hence, the inter-atomic distance and\nmaterial geometry are expected to affect fundamental superconductive\ncharacteristics. These parameters are tunable with strain, but strain\napplication is hindered by the rigidity of superconductors, which in turn\nincreases at device-relevant temperatures.

For example, the capability to pay back a loan for people in a certain\nsocial group might depend on historically how frequently that group has been\napproved loan applications. If banks keep rejecting loan applications to people\nin a disadvantaged group, it could create a feedback loop and further damage\nthe chance of getting loans for people in that group. In this paper, we\nformulate this delayed and long-term impact of actions within the context of\nmulti-armed bandits. We generalize the bandit setting to encode the dependency\nof this \"bias\" due to the action history during learning. The goal is to\nmaximize the collected utilities over time while taking into account the\ndynamics created by the delayed impacts of historical actions. We propose an\nalgorithm that achieves a regret of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(KT^{2/3})$ and show a\nmatching regret lower bound of $\\Omega(KT^{2/3})$, where $K$ is the number of\narms and $T$ is the learning horizon. Our results complement the bandit\nliterature by adding techniques to deal with actions with long-term impacts and\nhave implications in designing fair algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 15:43:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:13:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 19:28:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 17:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

This problem is crucial towards robustly\nlearning from data that are corrupted by, e.g., label noises and\nout-of-distribution samples. The standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) for\nsuch data, however, may easily overfit noises and thus suffers from sub-optimal\nperformance. In this paper, we observe that model predictions can substantially\nbenefit the training process: self-adaptive training significantly improves\ngeneralization over ERM under various levels of noises, and mitigates the\noverfitting issue in both natural and adversarial training. We evaluate the\nerror-capacity curve of self-adaptive training: the test error is monotonously\ndecreasing w.r.t. model capacity. This is in sharp contrast to the\nrecently-discovered double-descent phenomenon in ERM which might be a result of\noverfitting of noises.

Our motivation is the fact that the bone\nlengths of a human skeleton remain consistent across time.

Value and probability are inter-related\nvia Prospect Theory [4][5]. In this paper, we hypothesize that intertemporal\nchoices may also be quantized. For example, people may treat (or discount) 16\ndays indifferently to 17 days. To test this, we analyzed an intertemporal task\nby using 2 novel models: quantized hyperbolic discounting, and quantized\nexponential discounting. Our work here is a re-examination of the behavioral\ndata previously collected for an fMRI study [8]. Both quantized hyperbolic and\nquantized exponential models were compared using AIC and BIC tests. We found\nthat 13/20 participants were best fit to the quantized exponential model, while\nthe remaining 7/20 were best fit to the quantized hyperbolic model. Overall,\n15/20 participants were best fit to models with a 5-bit precision (i.e., 2^5 =\n32 steps).

Analysing biased datasets then leads to biased\noutcomes of the analysis. Bias by protected characteristics (e.g. race) is of\nparticular interest as it may not only make the output of analytical process\nsub-optimal, but also illegal. Countering the bias by constraining the\nanalytical outcomes to be fair is problematic because A) fairness lacks a\nuniversally accepted definition, while at the same time some definitions are\nmutually exclusive, and B) the use of optimisation constraints ensuring\nfairness is incompatible with most analytical pipelines. Both problems are\nsolved by methods which remove bias from the data and returning an altered\ndataset. This approach aims to not only remove the actual bias variable (e.g.\nrace), but also alter all proxy variables (e.g. postcode) so the bias variable\nis not detectable from the rest of the data. The advantage of using this\napproach is that the definition of fairness as a lack of detectable bias in the\ndata (as opposed to the output of analysis) is universal and therefore solves\nproblem (A). Furthermore, as the data is altered to remove bias the problem (B)\ndisappears because the analytical pipelines can remain unchanged. This approach\nhas been adopted by several technical solutions. None of them, however, seems\nto be satisfactory in terms of ability to remove multivariate, non-linear and\nnon-binary biases. Therefore, in this paper I propose the concept of Fair\nAdversarial Networks as an easy-to-implement general method for removing bias\nfrom data. This paper demonstrates that Fair Adversarial Networks achieve this\naim.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2020 16:39:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-28"}

AlignSeg consists of\ntwo primary modules, i.e., the Aligned Feature Aggregation (AlignFA) module and\nthe Aligned Context Modeling (AlignCM) module. First, AlignFA adopts a simple\nlearnable interpolation strategy to learn transformation offsets of pixels,\nwhich can effectively relieve the feature misalignment issue caused by\nmultiresolution feature aggregation.

Theoretically, the performance\nof a quantum embedding method should be limited by the computational cost of\nthe impurity solver. However, the practical performance of DMET is often\nhindered by the numerical stability and the computational time of the\ncorrelation potential fitting procedure, which is defined on a single-particle\nlevel. Of particular difficulty are cases in which the effective\nsingle-particle system is gapless or nearly gapless. To alleviate these issues,\nwe develop a semidefinite programming (SDP) based approach that can\nsignificantly enhance the robustness of the correlation potential fitting\nprocedure compared to the traditional least squares fitting approach.

However, the clustering-based approach has a number of problems;\ni.e., (i) it is not optimized to minimize diarization errors directly, (ii) it\ncannot handle speaker overlaps correctly, and (iii) it has trouble adapting\ntheir speaker embedding models to real audio recordings with speaker overlaps.\nTo solve these problems, we propose the End-to-End Neural Diarization (EEND),\nin which a neural network directly outputs speaker diarization results given a\nmulti-speaker recording. To realize such an end-to-end model, we formulate the\nspeaker diarization problem as a multi-label classification problem and\nintroduce a permutation-free objective function to directly minimize\ndiarization errors. Besides its end-to-end simplicity, the EEND method can\nexplicitly handle speaker overlaps during training and inference. Just by\nfeeding multi-speaker recordings with corresponding speaker segment labels, our\nmodel can be easily adapted to real conversations. We evaluated our method on\nsimulated speech mixtures and real conversation datasets. The results showed\nthat the EEND method outperformed the state-of-the-art x-vector\nclustering-based method, while it correctly handled speaker overlaps. We\nexplored the neural network architecture for the EEND method, and found that\nthe self-attention-based neural network was the key to achieving excellent\nperformance. In contrast to conditioning the network only on its previous and\nnext hidden states, as is done using bidirectional long short-term memory\n(BLSTM), self-attention is directly conditioned on all the frames. By\nvisualizing the attention weights, we show that self-attention captures global\nspeaker characteristics in addition to local speech activity dynamics, making\nit especially suitable for dealing with the speaker diarization problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 14:53:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-09"}
