However, these methods are still in\ntheir infancy and require special treatments, such as analyzing the KKT\ncondition, for deriving the backpropagation formula. In this paper, we propose\na new layer formulation called the fixed-point iteration (FPI) layer that\nfacilitates the use of more complicated operations in deep networks. The\nbackward FPI layer is also proposed for backpropagation, which is motivated by\nthe recurrent back-propagation (RBP) algorithm. But in contrast to RBP, the\nbackward FPI layer yields the gradient by a small network module without an\nexplicit calculation of the Jacobian. In actual applications, both the forward\nand backward FPI layers can be treated as nodes in the computational graphs.\nAll components in the proposed method are implemented at a high level of\nabstraction, which allows efficient higher-order differentiations on the nodes.\nIn addition, we present two practical methods of the FPI layer, FPI_NN and\nFPI_GD, where the update operations of FPI are a small neural network module\nand a single gradient descent step based on a learnable cost function,\nrespectively. FPI\\_NN is intuitive, simple, and fast to train, while FPI_GD can\nbe used for efficient training of energy networks that have been recently\nstudied. While RBP and its related studies have not been applied to practical\nexamples, our experiments show the FPI layer can be successfully applied to\nreal-world problems such as image denoising, optical flow, and multi-label\nclassification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 16:02:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 15:16:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 03:35:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 02:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

Here we investigate how long it\ntakes for a dilute swimmer suspension to reach the diffusive regime as well as\nwhat is the amplitude of the deviations from the diffusive dynamics. A linear\ntime dependence of the mean-squared displacement (MSD) is insufficient to\ncharacterize diffusion and thus we also focus on the excess kurtosis of the\ndisplacement distribution. Four swimming strategies are considered: (i) the\nconventional RT model with complete reorientation after tumbling, (ii) the case\nof partial reorientation, characterized by a distribution of tumbling angles,\n(iii) a run-and-reverse model with rotational diffusion, and (iv) a RT particle\nwhere the tumbling rate depends on the stochastic concentration of an internal\nprotein.

Moreover, the excess kurtosis can assume large positive\nvalues.

For example, to develop new, responsive\ndrug targets for ovarian cancer, the actual false discovery rate (FDR) of a\npractical feature selection procedure must also match the target FDR. The\npopular approach to feature selection, when true features are sparse, is to use\na penalized likelihood or a shrinkage estimation, such as a LASSO, SCAD,\nElastic Net, or MCP procedure (call them benchmark procedures). We present a\ndifferent approach using a new subsampling method, called the Subsampling\nWinner algorithm (SWA). The central idea of SWA is analogous to that used for\nthe selection of US national merit scholars. SWA uses a \"base procedure\" to\nanalyze each of the subsamples, computes the scores of all features according\nto the performance of each feature from all subsample analyses, obtains the\n\"semifinalist\" based on the resulting scores, and then determines the\n\"finalists,\" i.e., the most important features. Due to its subsampling nature,\nSWA can scale to data of any dimension in principle. The SWA also has the\nbest-controlled actual FDR in comparison with the benchmark procedures and the\nrandomForest, while having a competitive true-feature discovery rate. We also\nsuggest practical add-on strategies to SWA with or without a penalized\nbenchmark procedure to further assure the chance of \"true\" discovery. Our\napplication of SWA to the ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma specimens from the\nBroad Institute revealed functionally important genes and pathways, which we\nverified by additional genomics tools.

The\nconfirmation of its validity at different scales and in different contexts\nrepresents one of the main challenges of modern physics both from the\ntheoretical and the experimental points of view.

In this review, we\ndiscuss precision tests of gravity in General Relativity and alternative\ntheories and their relation with the Equivalence Principle.

Our results show that this novel distance provides meaningful\ncomparison of datasets, and correlates well with transfer learning hardness\nacross various experimental settings and datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 17:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-10"}

Despite their successful performance, CNNs suffer from a major\ndrawback. They fail to capture the hierarchy of spatial relation among\ndifferent parts of an entity. As a remedy to this problem, the idea of capsules\nwas proposed by Hinton. In this paper, we propose the SubSpace Capsule Network\n(SCN) that exploits the idea of capsule networks to model possible variations\nin the appearance or implicitly defined properties of an entity through a group\nof capsule subspaces instead of simply grouping neurons to create capsules. A\ncapsule is created by projecting an input feature vector from a lower layer\nonto the capsule subspace using a learnable transformation. This transformation\nfinds the degree of alignment of the input with the properties modeled by the\ncapsule subspace. We show that SCN is a general capsule network that can\nsuccessfully be applied to both discriminative and generative models without\nincurring computational overhead compared to CNN during test time.\nEffectiveness of SCN is evaluated through a comprehensive set of experiments on\nsupervised image classification, semi-supervised image classification and\nhigh-resolution image generation tasks using the generative adversarial network\n(GAN) framework. SCN significantly improves the performance of the baseline\nmodels in all 3 tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 17:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-10"}

Therefore, representation of aerosols in retrieval models requires\nthat they are described by only a few parameters, and this has been done in a\nvariety of ways within the literature. Here, I investigate a range of\nparameterisations for exoplanet aerosol and their effects on retrievals from\ntransmission spectra of hot Jupiters HD 189733b and HD 209458b. I find that\nresults qualitatively agree for the cloud/haze itself regardless of the\nparameterisation used, and indeed using multiple approaches provides a more\nholistic picture; the retrieved abundance of H2O is also very robust to\nassumptions about aerosols. I also find strong evidence that aerosol on HD\n209458b covers less than half of the terminator region, whilst the picture is\nless clear for HD 189733b.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 18:24:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 09:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

We derive lower bounds with logarithmic regret under $L_1$, $L_2$,\nand $L_\\infty$ constraints on the parameter values. The bounds are dominated by\n$d/2 \\log T$, where $T$ is the horizon and $d$ is the dimensionality of the\nparameter space. We show their achievability for $d=o(T^{1/3})$ in all these\ncases with Bayesian methods, that achieve them up to a $d/2 \\log d$ term.\nInteresting different behaviors are shown for larger dimensionality.\nSpecifically, on the negative side, if $d = \\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$, any algorithm is\nguaranteed regret of $\\Omega(d \\log T)$ (greater than $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$) under\n$L_\\infty$ constraints on the parameters (and the example features). On the\npositive side, under $L_1$ constraints on the parameters, there exist\nalgorithms that can achieve regret that is sub-linear in $d$ for the\nasymptotically larger values of $d$. For $L_2$ constraints, it is shown that\nfor large enough $d$, the regret remains linear in $d$ but no longer\nlogarithmic in $T$.

The Deep Underground\nNeutrino Experiment (DUNE) is an international world-class experiment dedicated\nto addressing these questions as it searches for leptonic charge-parity\nsymmetry violation, stands ready to capture supernova neutrino bursts, and\nseeks to observe nucleon decay as a signature of a grand unified theory\nunderlying the standard model.\n  The DUNE far detector technical design report (TDR) describes the DUNE\nphysics program and the technical designs of the single- and dual-phase DUNE\nliquid argon TPC far detector modules. This TDR is intended to justify the\ntechnical choices for the far detector that flow down from the high-level\nphysics goals through requirements at all levels of the Project. Volume I\ncontains an executive summary that introduces the DUNE science program, the far\ndetector and the strategy for its modular designs, and the organization and\nmanagement of the Project. The remainder of Volume I provides more detail on\nthe science program that drives the choice of detector technologies and on the\ntechnologies themselves. It also introduces the designs for the DUNE near\ndetector and the DUNE computing model, for which DUNE is planning design\nreports.\n  Volume II of this TDR describes DUNE's physics program in detail. Volume III\ndescribes the technical coordination required for the far detector design,\nconstruction, installation, and integration, and its organizational structure.\nVolume IV describes the single-phase far detector technology. A planned Volume\nV will describe the dual-phase technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 18:53:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 20:51:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 19:13:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

Many such high\nredshift galaxies display a red [3.6] - [4.5] micron colour, often referred to\nas the \"IRAC excess\", which has conventionally been interpreted as arising from\nintense [OIII]+Hbeta emission within the [4.5] micron bandpass. An appealing\naspect of this interpretation is similarly intense line emission seen in\nstar-forming galaxies at lower redshift as well as the redshift-dependent\nbehaviour of the IRAC colours beyond z~7 modelled as the various nebular lines\nmove through the two bandpasses. In this paper we demonstrate that, given the\nphotometric uncertainties, established stellar populations with Balmer (4000 A,\nrest-frame) breaks, such as those inferred at z>9 where line emission does not\ncontaminate the IRAC bands, can equally well explain the redshift-dependent\nbehaviour of the IRAC colours in 7<z<9 galaxies. We discuss possible ways of\ndistinguishing between the two hypotheses using ALMA measures of [OIII] 88\nmicron and dust continuum fluxes. Prior to further studies with JWST, we show\nthat the distinction is important in determining the assembly history of\ngalaxies in the first 500 Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

In\norder to reveal the gapless hinge states in the presence of mirror Chern\nsurface states, several ways of opening the surface gap are proposed and\nconfirmed by calculation, including cleaving the crystal to reveal a\nlow-symmetry surface, building a heterostructure, and applying strain.

Current and upcoming\ndetectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, LISA, ET, and DECIGO promise to identify\nthe full range from stellar-mass to supermassive black holes (SMBHs).

New-generation, nonlocal and\ndensity-dependent-kernel KEDFs are made computationally efficient by employing\nlinear splines and other methods for fast kernel builds. We showcase DFTpy by\nsolving for the electronic structure of a million-atom system of aluminum metal\nwhich was computed on a single CPU. The Python 3 implementation is\nobject-oriented, opening the door to easy implementation of new features. As an\nexample, we present a time-dependent OFDFT implementation (hydrodynamic DFT)\nwhich we use to compute the spectra of small metal cluster recovering\nqualitatively the time-dependent Kohn-Sham DFT result. The Python code base\nallows for easy implementation of APIs. We showcase the combination of DFTpy\nand ASE for molecular dynamics simulations (NVT) of liquid metals. DFTpy is\nreleased under the MIT license.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 19:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-24"}

One\ntechnique to address this issue is to relax the global\npositive-semidefiniteness (PSD) constraint and only enforce PSD-ness on smaller\n$k\\times k$ principal submatrices --- we call this the sparse SDP relaxation.\nSurprisingly, it has been observed empirically that in some cases this approach\nappears to produce bounds that are close to the optimal objective function\nvalue of the original SDP. In this paper, we formally attempt to compare the\nstrength of the sparse SDP relaxation vis-\\`a-vis the original SDP from a\ntheoretical perspective.\n  In order to simplify the question, we arrive at a data independent version of\nit, where we compare the sizes of SDP cone and the $k$-PSD closure, which is\nthe cone of matrices where PSD-ness is enforced on all $k\\times k$ principal\nsubmatrices. In particular, we investigate the question of how far a matrix of\nunit Frobenius norm in the $k$-PSD closure can be from the SDP cone. We provide\ntwo incomparable upper bounds on this farthest distance as a function of $k$\nand $n$. We also provide matching lower bounds, which show that the upper\nbounds are tight within a constant in different regimes of $k$ and $n$. Other\nthan linear algebra techniques, we extensively use probabilistic methods to\narrive at these bounds. One of the lower bounds is obtained by observing a\nconnection between matrices in the $k$-PSD closure and matrices satisfying the\nrestricted isometry property (RIP).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 19:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

Even for applications with extremely\nregular and homogeneous compute-communicate phases, simply adding communication\ntime to computation time does often not yield a satisfactory prediction of\nparallel runtime due to deviations from the expected simple lockstep pattern\ncaused by system noise, variations in communication time, and inherent load\nimbalance. In this paper, we highlight the specific cases of provoked and\nspontaneous desynchronization of memory-bound, bulk-synchronous pure MPI and\nhybrid MPI+OpenMP programs. Using simple microbenchmarks we observe that\nalthough desynchronization can introduce increased waiting time per process, it\ndoes not necessarily cause lower resource utilization but can lead to an\nincrease in available bandwidth per core. In case of significant communication\noverhead, even natural noise can shove the system into a state of automatic\noverlap of communication and computation, improving the overall time to\nsolution. The saturation point, i.e., the number of processes per memory domain\nrequired to achieve full memory bandwidth, is pivotal in the dynamics of this\nprocess and the emerging stable wave pattern. We also demonstrate how hybrid\nMPI-OpenMP programming can prevent desirable desynchronization by eliminating\nthe bandwidth bottleneck among processes. A Chebyshev filter diagonalization\napplication is used to demonstrate some of the observed effects in a realistic\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 19:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-25"}

The origins of the correlated insulators and\nsuperconductivity, and the interplay between them, are particularly elusive.\nBoth states have been previously observed only for angles within $\\pm0.1^\\circ$\nfrom the magic-angle value and occur in adjacent or overlapping electron\ndensity ranges; nevertheless, it is still unclear how the two states are\nrelated. Beyond the twist angle and strain, the dependence of the TBG phase\ndiagram on the alignment and thickness of insulating hexagonal boron nitride\n(hBN) used to encapsulate the graphene sheets indicates the importance of the\nmicroscopic dielectric environment. Here we show that adding an insulating\ntungsten-diselenide (WSe$_2$) monolayer between hBN and TBG stabilizes\nsuperconductivity at twist angles much smaller than the established magic-angle\nvalue. For the smallest angle of $\\theta$ = 0.79$^\\circ$, we still observe\nclear superconducting signatures, despite the complete absence of the\ncorrelated insulating states and vanishing gaps between the dispersive and flat\nbands. These observations demonstrate that, even though electron correlations\nmay be important, superconductivity in TBG can exist even when TBG exhibits\nmetallic behaviour across the whole range of electron density.\nFinite-magnetic-field measurements further reveal breaking of the four-fold\nspin-valley symmetry in the system, consistent with large spin-orbit coupling\ninduced in TBG via proximity to WSe$_2$. Our results highlight the importance\nof symmetry breaking effects in stabilizing electronic states in TBG and open\nnew avenues for engineering quantum phases in moir\\'e systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 20:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-23"}

This motivates the basket trial, which assesses the\nefficacy of treatment simultaneously on multiple cancer types that have a\ncommon aberration. Although the assumption of homogeneous treatment effects\nseems reasonable given the shared aberration, in reality, the treatment effect\nmay vary by cancer type, and potentially only a subgroup of the cancer types\nrespond to the treatment. Various approaches have been proposed to increase the\ntrial power by borrowing information across cancer types, which, however, tend\nto inflate the type I error rate. In this paper, we review some representative\nBayesian information borrowing methods for the analysis of early-phase basket\ntrials. We then propose a novel method called the Bayesian hierarchical model\nwith a correlated prior (CBHM), which conducts more flexible borrowing across\ncancer types according to sample similarity. We did simulation studies to\ncompare CBHM with independent analysis and three information borrowing\napproaches: the conventional Bayesian hierarchical model, the EXNEX approach\nand Liu's two-stage approach. Simulation results show that all information\nborrowing approaches substantially improve the power of independent analysis if\na large proportion of the cancer types truly respond to the treatment. Our\nproposed CBHM approach shows an advantage over the existing information\nborrowing approaches, with a power similar to that of EXNEX or Liu's approach,\nbut the potential to provide substantially better control of type I error rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 20:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

In this paper, we benchmark several blind source\nseparation techniques for analysis of NMR spectral datasets containing negative\nintensity. For benchmarking purposes, we generated a large synthetic datasbase\nof quadrupolar solid-state NMR-like spectra that model spin-lattice T1\nrelaxation or nutation tip/flip angle experiments. Our benchmarking approach\nfocused exclusively on the ability of blind source separation techniques to\nreproduce the spectra of the underlying pure components. In general, we find\nthat FastICA (Fast Independent Component Analysis), SIMPLISMA\n(SIMPLe-to-use-Interactive Self-modeling Mixture Analysis), and NNMF\n(Non-Negative Matrix Factorization) are top-performing techniques. We\ndemonstrate that dataset normalization approaches prior to blind source\nseparation do not considerably improve outcomes. Within the range of noise\nlevels studied, we did not find drastic changes to the ranking of techniques.\nThe accuracy of FastICA and SIMPLISMA degrades quickly if excess (unreal) pure\ncomponents are predicted. Our results indicate poor performance of SVD\n(Singular Value Decomposition) methods, and we propose alternative techniques\nfor matrix initialization. The benchmarked techniques are also applied to real\nsolid state NMR datasets. In general, the recommendations from the synthetic\ndatasets agree with the recommendations and results from the real data\nanalysis. The discussion provides some additional recommendations for\nspectroscopists applying blind source separation to NMR datasets, and for\nfuture benchmark studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 20:57:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

DUNE is an\ninternational world-class experiment dedicated to addressing these questions as\nit searches for leptonic charge-parity symmetry violation, stands ready to\ncapture supernova neutrino bursts, and seeks to observe nucleon decay as a\nsignature of a grand unified theory underlying the standard model.\n  Central to achieving DUNE's physics program is a far detector that combines\nthe many tens-of-kiloton fiducial mass necessary for rare event searches with\nsub-centimeter spatial resolution in its ability to image those events,\nallowing identification of the physics signatures among the numerous\nbackgrounds. In the single-phase liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC)\ntechnology, ionization charges drift horizontally in the liquid argon under the\ninfluence of an electric field towards a vertical anode, where they are read\nout with fine granularity.

In the kinematical region of very forward rapidities,\nheavy-flavor production and decay is a source of tau neutrinos that leads to\nthousands of { charged-current} tau neutrino events in a 1 m long, 1 m radius\nlead neutrino detector at a distance of 480 m from the interaction region. In\nour computation, next-to-leading order QCD radiative corrections are accounted\nfor in the production cross-sections. Non-perturbative intrinsic-$k_T$ effects\nare approximated by a simple phenomenological model introducing a Gaussian\n$k_T$-smearing of the parton distribution functions, which might also mimic\nperturbative effects due to multiple initial-state soft-gluon emissions. The\ntransition from partonic to hadronic states is described by phenomenological\nfragmentation functions. To study the effect of various input parameters,\ntheoretical predictions for $D_s^\\pm$ production are compared with LHCb data on\ndouble-differential cross-sections in transverse momentum and rapidity. The\nuncertainties related to the choice of the input parameter values, ultimately\naffecting the predictions of the tau neutrino event distributions, are\ndiscussed. We consider a 3+1 neutrino mixing scenario to illustrate the\npotential for a neutrino experiment to constrain the 3+1 parameter space using\ntau neutrinos and antineutrinos. We find large theoretical uncertainties in the\npredictions of the neutrino fluxes in the far-forward region. Untangling the\neffects of tau neutrino oscillations into sterile neutrinos and distinguishing\na 3+1 scenario from the standard scenario with three active neutrino flavours,\nwill be challenging due to the large theoretical uncertainties from QCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 21:13:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 10:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

For the case of weak scale\nsupersymmetry (SUSY), LHC has found rather generally that gluinos are beyond\nabout 2.2 TeV whilst top squark must lie beyond 1.1 TeV. These limits\ncontradict older simplistic notions of naturalness that emerged in the\n1980s-1990s, leading to the rather pessimistic view that SUSY is now excluded\nexcept for perhaps some remaining narrow corners of parameter space. Yet, this\npicture ignores several important developments in SUSY/string theory that\nemerged in the 21st century: 1. the emergence of the string theory landscape\nand its solution to the cosmological constant problem, 2. a more nuanced view\nof naturalness including the notion of \"stringy naturalness\", 3. the emergence\nof anomaly-free discrete R-symmetries and their connection to R-parity,\nPeccei-Quinn symmetry, the SUSY mu problem and proton decay and 4. the\nimportance of including a solution to the strong CP problem. Rather general\nconsiderations from the string theory landscape favor large values of soft\nterms, subject to the vacuum selection criteria that electroweak symmetry is\nproperly broken (no CCB minima) and the resulting magnitude of the weak scale\nis not too far from our measured value. Then stringy naturalness predicts a\nHiggs mass m_h~ 125 GeV whilst sparticle masses are typically lifted beyond\npresent LHC bounds. In light of these refinements in theory perspective\nconfronted by LHC and dark matter search results, we review the most likely\nLHC, ILC and dark matter signatures that are expected to arise from weak scale\nSUSY as we understand it today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 21:15:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 18:27:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 16:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

Bob makes a Bell\nmeasurement in the single photon basis and characterizes the scheme with its\naverage quantum teleportation fidelity. Fidelities close to one are expected\nfor qubits in a wide spectral range. The work also includes a discussion about\nthe fidelity dependence on the geometrical properties of the medium through\nwhich the HER is generated. An important remark is that no spectral filtering\nis employed in the heralding process, which emphasizes the feasibility of this\nscheme without compromising photon flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 21:20:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

In this frame, maps preserving graphs or posets are exactly the\nnonexpansive mappings (that is the maps $f$ such that $d(f(x),f(y))\\leq\nd(x,y)$, for all $x,y$). It was observed that many known results on retractions\nand fixed point property for classical metric spaces (whose morphisms are the\nnonexpansive mappings) are also valid for these spaces.

A lack of\ncommon underlying representation between arbitrary languages means detecting\nclones requires one of the following solutions: 1) a static analysis framework\nreplicated across each targeted language with annotations matching language\nfeatures across all languages, or 2) a dynamic analysis framework that detects\nclones based on runtime behavior.\n  In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of the latter solution, a\ndynamic analysis approach called SLACC for cross-language clone detection. Like\nprior clone detection techniques, we use input/output behavior to match clones,\nthough we overcome limitations of prior work by amplifying the number of inputs\nand covering more data types; and as a result, achieve better clusters than\nprior attempts. Since clusters are generated based on input/output behavior,\nSLACC supports cross-language clone detection. As an added challenge, we target\na static typed language, Java, and a dynamic typed language, Python. Compared\nto HitoshiIO, a recent clone detection tool for Java, SLACC retrieves 6 times\nas many clusters and has higher precision (86.7% vs. 30.7%).\n  This is the first work to perform clone detection for dynamic typed languages\n(precision = 87.3%) and the first to perform clone detection across languages\nthat lack a common underlying representation (precision = 94.1%). It provides a\nfirst step towards the larger goal of scalable language migration tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 22:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

We propose that socially assistive robots (SARs) could help people\nwith health conditions maintain positive social lives by supporting them in\nsocial interactions. This paper makes three contributions, as detailed below.\nWe develop a framework of social mediation functions that robots could perform,\nmotivated by the special social needs that people with health conditions have.\nIn this framework we identify five types of functions that SARs could perform:\na) changing how the person is perceived, b) enhancing the social behavior of\nthe person, c) modifying the social behavior of others, d) providing structure\nfor interactions, and e) changing how the person feels. We thematically\norganize and review the existing literature on robots supporting human-human\ninteractions, in both clinical and non-clinical settings, and explain how the\nfindings and design ideas from these studies can be applied to the functions\nidentified in the framework.

We identify three core challenges in\nthe realm of learning from, understanding, and supporting developers writing\nDevOps artifacts: (i) nested languages in DevOps artifacts, (ii) rule mining,\nand (iii) the lack of semantic rule-based analysis. To address these challenges\nwe introduce a toolset, binnacle, that enabled us to ingest 900,000 GitHub\nrepositories.\n  Focusing on Docker, we extracted approximately 178,000 unique Dockerfiles,\nand also identified a Gold Set of Dockerfiles written by Docker experts.

Through this\nautomated mining, we were able to recover 16 new rules that were not found\nduring manual rule collection. To address challenge (iii), we manually\ncollected a set of rules for Dockerfiles from commits to the files in the Gold\nSet. These rules encapsulate best practices, avoid docker build failures, and\nimprove image size and build latency. We created an analyzer that used these\nrules, and found that, on average, Dockerfiles on GitHub violated the rules\nfive times more frequently than the Dockerfiles in our Gold Set.

Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are good solvers for optimization\nproblems ubiquitous in various problem domains, however traditional operators\nfor EAs are 'blind' to constraints or generally use problem dependent objective\nfunctions; as they do not exploit information from the constraints in search\nfor solutions.

These\nrecent advances have made it possible to get full CI (FCI) quality results for\nmuch larger orbital active spaces, compared to conventional approaches.\nHowever, due to the starting assumption that the FCI vector has only a small\nnumber of significant Slater determinants, SCI becomes intractable for systems\nwith strong correlation. This paper introduces a method for developing SCI\nalgorithms in a way which exploits local molecular structure to significantly\nreduce the number of SCI variables. The proposed method is defined by first\ngrouping the orbitals into clusters over which we can define many particle\ncluster states. We then directly perform the SCI algorithm in a basis of tensor\nproducts of cluster states instead of Slater determinants. While the approach\nis general for arbitrarily defined cluster states, we find significantly\nimproved performance by defining cluster states through a Tucker decomposition\nof the global (and sparse) SCI vector.

Due to the large action vocabulary in egocentric video datasets,\nrecent studies usually utilize a two-branch structure for action recognition,\nie, one branch for verb classification and the other branch for noun\nclassification. However, correlation studies between the verb and the noun\nbranches have been largely ignored. Besides, the two branches fail to exploit\nlocal features due to the absence of a position-aware attention mechanism. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Symbiotic Attention framework leveraging\nPrivileged information (SAP) for egocentric video recognition. Finer\nposition-aware object detection features can facilitate the understanding of\nactor's interaction with the object. We introduce these features in action\nrecognition and regard them as privileged information. Our framework enables\nmutual communication among the verb branch, the noun branch, and the privileged\ninformation. This communication process not only injects local details into\nglobal features but also exploits implicit guidance about the spatio-temporal\nposition of an on-going action. We introduce novel symbiotic attention (SA) to\nenable effective communication. It first normalizes the detection guided\nfeatures on one branch to underline the action-relevant information from the\nother branch. SA adaptively enhances the interactions among the three sources.\nTo further catalyze this communication, spatial relations are uncovered for the\nselection of most action-relevant information. It identifies the most valuable\nand discriminative feature for classification. We validate the effectiveness of\nour SAP quantitatively and qualitatively.

Advanced materials and morphing wing technologies are resulting in\nnext-generation aeroelastic systems that are characterized by highly-coupled\nand nonlinear interactions between the aerodynamic and structural dynamics. In\nthis work, we leverage emerging data-driven modeling techniques to develop\nhighly accurate and tractable reduced-order aeroelastic models that are valid\nover a wide range of operating conditions and are suitable for control. In\nparticular, we develop two extensions to the recent dynamic mode decomposition\nwith control (DMDc) algorithm to make it suitable for flexible aeroelastic\nsystems: 1) we introduce a formulation to handle algebraic equations, and 2) we\ndevelop an interpolation scheme to smoothly connect several linear DMDc models\ndeveloped in different operating regimes. Thus, the innovation lies in\naccurately modeling the nonlinearities of the coupled aerostructural dynamics\nover multiple operating regimes, not restricting the validity of the model to a\nnarrow region around a linearization point. We demonstrate this approach on a\nhigh-fidelity, three-dimensional numerical model of an airborne wind energy\n(AWE) system, although the methods are generally applicable to any highly\ncoupled aeroelastic system or dynamical system operating over multiple\noperating regimes.

Most CPDP techniques involve two major steps,\ni.e., transfer learning and classification, each of which has at least one\nparameter to be tuned to achieve their optimal performance. This practice fits\nwell with the purpose of automated parameter optimization. However, there is a\nlack of thorough understanding about what are the impacts of automated\nparameter optimization on various CPDP techniques. In this paper, we present\nthe first empirical study that looks into such impacts on 62 CPDP techniques,\n13 of which are chosen from the existing CPDP literature while the other 49\nones have not been explored before. We build defect prediction models over 20\nreal-world software projects that are of different scales and characteristics.\nOur findings demonstrate that: (1) Automated parameter optimization\nsubstantially improves the defect prediction performance of 77\\% CPDP\ntechniques with a manageable computational cost. Thus more efforts on this\naspect are required in future CPDP studies. (2) Transfer learning is of\nultimate importance in CPDP. Given a tight computational budget, it is more\ncost-effective to focus on optimizing the parameter configuration of transfer\nlearning algorithms (3) The research on CPDP is far from mature where it is\n\"not difficult\" to find a better alternative by making a combination of\nexisting transfer learning and classification techniques. This finding provides\nimportant insights about the future design of CPDP techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Feb 2020 12:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

This paper proposes an\naudio watermarking framework from the perspective of TF analysis. The proposed\nframework treats the host audio signal in the 2-dimensional (2D) TF plane, and\nselects a series of patches within the 2D TF image. These patches correspond to\nthe TF clusters with minimum averaged energy, and are used to form the feature\nvectors for watermark embedding.

The feature patches that carry the\nwatermarks only occupy a few TF regions of the host audio signal, thus leading\nto improved imperceptibility property. In addition, since the feature patches\ncontain a neighborhood area of TF representation of audio samples, the\ncorrelations among the samples within a single patch could be exploited for\nimproved robustness against a series of processing attacks.

For a given dataset $S$ of $n$ elements, the problem requires to\ndetermine a subset of $S$ containing $k\\ll n$ \"representatives\" which minimize\nsome diversity function expressed in terms of pairwise distances, where\ndistance models dissimilarity. An important variant of the problem prescribes\nthat the solution satisfy an additional orthogonal requirement, which can be\nspecified as a matroid constraint (i.e., a feasible solution must be an\nindependent set of size $k$ of a given matroid). While unconstrained diversity\nmaximization admits efficient coreset-based strategies for several diversity\nfunctions, known approaches dealing with the additional matroid constraint\napply only to one diversity function (sum of distances), and are based on an\nexpensive, inherently sequential, local search over the entire input dataset.\nWe devise the first coreset-based algorithms for diversity maximization under\nmatroid constraints for various diversity functions, together with efficient\nsequential, MapReduce and Streaming implementations.

His organisation\nof and contributions to the Nuffield Workshop in 1982 consolidated the picture\nthat the large-scale structure of the universe originated as quantum\nfluctuations during the inflationary era. Work on the interplay between quantum\nmechanics and general relativity resulted in his formulation of the concept of\nthe wavefunction of the universe.

Such\ncharacteristic heavily constrains their capability to learn implicit visual\ngrammars behind the collaboration of different visual cues (i,e., hand shape,\nfacial expression and body posture). By injecting multi-cue learning into\nneural network design, we propose a spatial-temporal multi-cue (STMC) network\nto solve the vision-based sequence learning problem. Our STMC network consists\nof a spatial multi-cue (SMC) module and a temporal multi-cue (TMC) module. The\nSMC module is dedicated to spatial representation and explicitly decomposes\nvisual features of different cues with the aid of a self-contained pose\nestimation branch. The TMC module models temporal correlations along two\nparallel paths, i.e., intra-cue and inter-cue, which aims to preserve the\nuniqueness and explore the collaboration of multiple cues. Finally, we design a\njoint optimization strategy to achieve the end-to-end sequence learning of the\nSTMC network. To validate the effectiveness, we perform experiments on three\nlarge-scale CSLR benchmarks: PHOENIX-2014, CSL and PHOENIX-2014-T.

It was widely anticipated that superpartners\nwould reveal themselves once the TeV scale was probed in high energy\ncollisions. Experiments at the LHC have not yet revealed any sign for direct\nproduction of superpartners, or for any other physics beyond the Standard\nModel. This has led to some authors to question whether weak scale SUSY has a\nrole to play in stabilizing the Higgs sector. We show that SUSY models with\njust the minimal particle content may well be consistent with data and\nsimultaneously serve to stabilize the Higgs sector, if model parameters\ngenerally regarded as independent turn out to be appropriately correlated. In\nour view, it would be premature to ignore this possibility, given that we do\nnot understand the underlying mechanism of SUSY breaking. We advocate using the\nelectroweak scale quantity, $\\delew$, to determine whether a given SUSY\nspectrum might arise from a theory with low fine-tuning, even when the\nparameters correlations mentioned above are present.

Some\nknown limitations of the previously published Alpha model are addressed, and\nthe numerical uncertainty due to discretization of the improved model, Beta,\nwas estimated. In Part 1, the Beta model is compared to Alpha, where\nsignificant albeit small differences are seen. Shortcomings of the improved\nmodel are discussed, paving the way forward, while a discrepancy with previous\nresults is addressed, further suggesting the use of the Darcy-Brinkman over\nStokes-Darcy formulation for free and porous media flow. Furthermore, a\nparametric study is carried out, constraining plausible values of the reaction\nrate constants identifying additional opportunities for validation. In Part 2,\na mesh convergence study is carried out to estimate the discretization error of\nBeta model. A reduced, proxy geometry and two extrapolation schemes are used to\nestimate the exact solution, which is then used to estimate the model's\nuncertainty through the Grid Convergence Index framework. Error estimates are\non average $\\sim 10\\%$ for the flow rate range simulated, larger than\nexperimental ones available. Results suggest a difficulty in achieving mesh\nconvergence in fuel cell-like models, even in simpler cases. Caution is thus\nsuggested during validation or when devising predictions from numerical models.\nFinally, given the uncertainties in the numerical data and the available\nexperimental data, the results lack validation power, highlighting the need for\nadditional experimental data and improved precision for the numerical data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 19:29:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 17:22:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 14:30:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-16"}

Numerous models were proposed to label various data and many approaches\nwere designed to enhance the ability of deep learning models or accelerate\nthem. Unfortunately, a single machine-learning model is not powerful enough to\nextract various semantic information from data. Given certain applications,\nsuch as image retrieval platforms and photo album management apps, it is often\nrequired to execute a collection of models to obtain sufficient labels. With\nlimited computing resources and stringent delay, given a data stream and a\ncollection of applicable resource-hungry deep-learning models, we design a\nnovel approach to adaptively schedule a subset of these models to execute on\neach data item, aiming to maximize the value of the model output (e.g., the\nnumber of high-confidence labels). Achieving this lofty goal is nontrivial\nsince a model's output on any data item is content-dependent and unknown until\nwe execute it. To tackle this, we propose an Adaptive Model Scheduling\nframework, consisting of 1) a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to\npredict the value of unexecuted models by mining semantic relationship among\ndiverse models, and 2) two heuristic algorithms to adaptively schedule the\nmodel execution order under a deadline or deadline-memory constraints\nrespectively. The proposed framework doesn't require any prior knowledge of the\ndata, which works as a powerful complement to existing model optimization\ntechnologies. We conduct extensive evaluations on five diverse image datasets\nand 30 popular image labeling models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our\ndesign: our design could save around 53\\% execution time without loss of any\nvaluable labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Feb 2020 03:54:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-14"}

Both facial and body\nkeypoints are critical in some medical diagnoses, and keypoints invariability\nafter de-identification is of great importance. Here, we propose a solution\nusing deepfake technology, the face swapping technique.
