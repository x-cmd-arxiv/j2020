From the modelling point of view, we adopt a\nreduction strategy that treats fractures as manifolds of codimension one and we\nemploy the primal version of Darcy's law to describe the flow in both the bulk\nand the fracture network. In addition, some physically consistent conditions\ncouple the two problems, allowing for jump of pressure at their interface, and\nthey as well prescribe the behaviour of the fluid along the intersections,\nimposing pressure continuity and flux conservation. Both the bulk and fracture\ndiscretizations are obtained employing the Symmetric Interior Penalty DG method\nextended to the polytopic setting. The key instrument to obtain a polyDG\napproximation of the problem in the fracture network is the generalization of\nthe concepts of jump and average at the intersection, so that the contribution\nfrom all the fractures is taken into account. We prove the well-posedness of\nthe discrete formulation and perform an error analysis obtaining a priori\nhp-error estimates. All our theoretical results are validated performing\npreliminary numerical tests with known analytical solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Feb 2020 18:08:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 21:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

Nevertheless,\nthe transport of active matter with non-directional (rotational) activity is\nyet to be understood, despite the ubiquity of rotating modes of motion in\nsynthetic and natural systems.

If\nthese scenarios are accurate, a consequence of the denser 2G formation\nenvironment is that 2G binaries should be more significantly affected by\nstellar interactions and disrupted at a larger rate than 1G binaries. The\nfractions and properties of binary stars can thus provide a dynamical\nfingerprint of the formation epoch of multiple-population GCs and their\nsubsequent dynamical evolution. We investigate the connection between binaries\nand multiple populations in five GCs, NGC 288, NGC 6121 (M 4), NGC 6352, NGC\n6362, and NGC 6838 (M 71). To do this, we introduce a new method based on the\ncomparison of Hubble Space Telescope observations of binaries in the F275W,\nF336W, F438W, F606W and F814W filters with a large number of simulated\nbinaries.

The results found are in\ngeneral agreement with the results of simulations predicting significant\ndifferences in the global 1G and 2G incidences and in the local values in the\nclusters' outer regions but similar incidences in the inner regions. The\nsignificant difference found in M 4 is consistent with simulations with a\nlarger fraction of wider binaries. Our analysis also provides the first\nevidence of mixed (1G-2G) binaries, a population predicted by numerical\nsimulations to form in a cluster's inner regions as a result of stellar\nencounters during which one component of a binary is replaced by a star of a\ndifferent population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 00:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

To settle several fundamental issues of the SC on the QC, we\nuse an attractive Hubbard model to perform a systematic study on the Penrose\nlattice. The first issue is the Cooper instability of the QC, i.e., no Fermi\nsurface under an infinitesimal attractive interaction. Starting from the\ntwo-electron problem outside the filled Fermi-sea, we analytically prove that\nan infinitesimal Hubbard attraction can lead to the Cooper instability as long\nas the density of state is nonzero at the Fermi level, which provides the basis\nof the SC on the QC. Our numerical results yield that the Cooper pairing always\ntakes place between the two time-reversal states, satisfying the Anderson's\ntheorem. On this theorem, we perform a mean-field (MF) study at both zero and\nfinite temperatures. The MF study also shows that an arbitrarily weak\nattraction can lead to the pairing order, with the resulted pairing state being\nwell described by the BCS theory and the thermal dynamic behaviors being well\nconsistent with experimental results. The second issue is about the superfluid\ndensity on the QC without translational symmetry. It's clarified that although\nthe normal state of the system locates at the critical point of the\nmetal-insulator transition, the pairing state exhibits real SC, carrying finite\nsuperfluid density that can be verified by the Meissner effect, consistent with\nexperiment also.

Their performance degrades drastically when applied to\nreal-world scenarios where the input image is always contaminated by noise. In\nthis paper, we propose a Facial Attribute Capsules Network (FACN) to deal with\nthe problem of high-scale super-resolution of noisy face image. Capsule is a\ngroup of neurons whose activity vector models different properties of the same\nentity. Inspired by the concept of capsule, we propose an integrated\nrepresentation model of facial information, which named Facial Attribute\nCapsule (FAC). In the SR processing, we first generated a group of FACs from\nthe input LR face, and then reconstructed the HR face from this group of FACs.\nAiming to effectively improve the robustness of FAC to noise, we generate FAC\nin semantic, probabilistic and facial attributes manners by means of integrated\nlearning strategy. Each FAC can be divided into two sub-capsules: Semantic\nCapsule (SC) and Probabilistic Capsule (PC). Them describe an explicit facial\nattribute in detail from two aspects of semantic representation and probability\ndistribution. The group of FACs model an image as a combination of facial\nattribute information in the semantic space and probabilistic space by an\nattribute-disentangling way. The diverse FACs could better combine the face\nprior information to generate the face images with fine-grained semantic\nattributes. Extensive benchmark experiments show that our method achieves\nsuperior hallucination results and outperforms state-of-the-art for very low\nresolution (LR) noise face image super resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 06:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

Recently, it is observed that SM training sequences\nderived from corss Z-complementary pairs (CZCPs) lead to optimal channel\nestimation performance over frequency-selective channels. CZCPs are special\nform of sequence pairs which have zero aperiodic autocorrelation zones and\ncross-correlation zone at certain time-shifts. Recent paper by Liu \\textit{et\nal.} discussed only perfect CZCPs. In this paper, we focus on non-perfect\nCZCPs. We introduce the term cross Z-complementary ratio and re-categorise the\nCZCPs, both perfect and non-perfect, based on that. We propose a systematic\nconstruction of CZCPs based on generalised Boolean functions (GBFs). We further\nextend the lengths of the CZCPs by using the insertion method. The proposed\nCZCPs are all of new lengths of the form\n$2^\\alpha10^\\beta26^\\gamma+2~(\\alpha\\geq1)$, $10^\\beta+2$, $26^\\gamma+2$ and\n$10^\\beta 26^\\gamma+2$.

During the\nproof, we also found a new structural property of binary CZCPs and concluded\nall binary GCPs are CZCPs too.

A comparison of core\nrotation rates found in this way with core rotation rates as predicted by\nstellar evolution models demonstrate a large discrepancy. This means that there\nmust be a process of angular momentum transport missing in the current theory\nof stellar evolution. A new formalism was recently proposed to fill in for this\nmissing process, which has the Tayler instability as its starting point\n(hereafter referred to as `Fuller-formalism'). Aims: We investigate the effect\nof the Fuller-formalism on the internal rotation of stellar models with an\ninitial mass of 2.5 Mo. Methods: Stellar evolution models, including the\nFuller-formalism, of intermediate-mass stars were calculated to make a\ncomparison between asteroseismically obtained core rotation rates in the core\nHe burning phase and in the white dwarf phase. Results: Our main results show\nthat models including the Fuller-formalism can match the core rotation rates\nobtained for the core He burning phases. However, these models are unable to\nmatch the rotation rates obtained for white dwarfs. When we exclude the\nFuller-formalism at the end of the core He burning phase, the white dwarf\nrotation rates of the models match the observed rates. Conclusions: We conclude\nthat in the present form, the Fuller-formalism cannot be the sole solution for\nthe missing process of angular momentum transport in intermediate-mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 12:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

Containing\nspreading dynamics (e.g., epidemic transmission and misinformation propagation)\nin networked systems is a hot topic in multiple fronts. Most of the previous\nstrategies are based on the immunization of nodes. However, sometimes, these\nnode--based strategies can be impractical. For instance, in the train\ntransportation networks, it is dramatic to isolating train stations for flu\nprevention. On the contrary, temporarily suspending some connections between\nstations is more acceptable. Thus, we pay attention to the edge-based\ncontaining strategy. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework to find\nthe optimal edge for containing the spreading of the\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible model on complex networks. In specific, by\nperforming a perturbation method to the discrete-Markovian-chain equations of\nthe SIS model, we derive a formula that approximately provides the decremental\noutbreak size after the deactivation of a certain edge in the network. Then, we\ndetermine the optimal edge by simply choosing the one with the largest\ndecremental outbreak size. Note that our proposed theoretical framework\nincorporates the information of both network structure and spreading dynamics.\nFinally, we test the performance of our method by extensive numerical\nsimulations. Results demonstrate that our strategy always outperforms other\nstrategies based only on structural properties (degree or edge betweenness\ncentrality). The theoretical framework in this study can be extended to other\nspreading models and offers inspirations for further investigations on\nedge-based immunization strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 12:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

First, acquiring pixel-wise labels is expensive and time-consuming.\nSecond, realistic segmentation datasets are highly unbalanced: some categories\nare much more abundant than others, biasing the performance to the most\nrepresented ones. In this paper, we are interested in focusing human labelling\neffort on a small subset of a larger pool of data, minimizing this effort while\nmaximizing performance of a segmentation model on a hold-out set. We present a\nnew active learning strategy for semantic segmentation based on deep\nreinforcement learning (RL). An agent learns a policy to select a subset of\nsmall informative image regions -- opposed to entire images -- to be labeled,\nfrom a pool of unlabeled data. The region selection decision is made based on\npredictions and uncertainties of the segmentation model being trained. Our\nmethod proposes a new modification of the deep Q-network (DQN) formulation for\nactive learning, adapting it to the large-scale nature of semantic segmentation\nproblems. We test the proof of concept in CamVid and provide results in the\nlarge-scale dataset Cityscapes. On Cityscapes, our deep RL region-based DQN\napproach requires roughly 30% less additional labeled data than our most\ncompetitive baseline to reach the same performance. Moreover, we find that our\nmethod asks for more labels of under-represented categories compared to the\nbaselines, improving their performance and helping to mitigate class imbalance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 14:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

The graph is a stylized model for how people from\ndifferent populations are presented opportunities, eventually leading to some\nreward. In our model, individuals are born into an initial position (i.e. some\nnode in the first layer of the graph) according to a fixed probability\ndistribution, and then stochastically progress through the graph according to\nthe transition matrices, until they reach a node in the final layer of the\ngraph; each node in the final layer has a \\emph{reward} associated with it. The\npipeline intervention problem asks how to best make costly changes to the\ntransition matrices governing people's stochastic transitions through the\ngraph, subject to a budget constraint. We consider two objectives: social\nwelfare maximization, and a fairness-motivated maximin objective that seeks to\nmaximize the value to the population (starting node) with the \\emph{least}\nexpected value. We consider two variants of the maximin objective that turn out\nto be distinct, depending on whether we demand a deterministic solution or\nallow randomization.

Finally we show that for polynomial width\nnetworks, even approximating the maximin objective to any constant factor is NP\nhard, even for networks with constant depth.

In class one approach, we have to ansatz one of the metric\npotentials and the other can be obtain from the Karmarkar condition. In this\npaper, we are proposing new class one solution which is well-behaved in all\nphysical points of view. We have analyzed the nature of the solution by tuning\nthe $f(R,T)-$coupling parameter $\\chi$ and found that the solution results into\nstiffer EoS for $\\chi=-1$ than $\\chi=1$. This is because for lesser values of\n$\\chi$, velocity of sound is more, higher $M_{max}$ in $M-R$ curve and the EoS\nparameter $\\omega$ is larger. The solution satisfy the causality condition,\nenergy conditions, stable and static under radial perturbations (static\nstability criterion) and in equilibrium (modified TOV-equation). The resulting\n$M-R$ diagram from this solution is well fitted with observed values of few\ncompact stars such as PSR J1614-2230, Vela X-1, Cen X-3 and SAX J1808.4-3658.\nTherefore, for different values of $\\chi$, we have predicted the corresponding\nradii and their respective moment of inertia from the $M-I$ curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Feb 2020 16:04:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

In this work, we propose to replace any\ntraditional convolutional layer with an autoregressive moving-average (ARMA)\nlayer, a novel module with an adjustable receptive field controlled by the\nlearnable autoregressive coefficients. Compared with traditional convolutional\nlayers, our ARMA layer enables explicit interconnections of the output neurons\nand learns its receptive field by adapting the autoregressive coefficients of\nthe interconnections. ARMA layer is adjustable to different types of tasks: for\ntasks where global information is crucial, it is capable of learning relatively\nlarge autoregressive coefficients to allow for an output neuron's receptive\nfield covering the entire input; for tasks where only local information is\nrequired, it can learn small or near zero autoregressive coefficients and\nautomatically reduces to a traditional convolutional layer. We show both\ntheoretically and empirically that the effective receptive field of networks\nwith ARMA layers (named as ARMA networks) expands with larger autoregressive\ncoefficients. We also provably solve the instability problem of learning and\nprediction in the ARMA layer through a re-parameterization mechanism.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that ARMA networks substantially improve their\nbaselines on challenging dense prediction tasks including video prediction and\nsemantic segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Feb 2020 23:18:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 04:12:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-28"}

The key idea is to use neural networks to convert words in texts to\nvector space representations based on word positions in a sentence and their\ncontexts, which are suitable for end-to-end training of downstream tasks. We\nsee a strikingly similar situation in spatial analysis, which focuses on\nincorporating both absolute positions and spatial contexts of geographic\nobjects such as POIs into models. A general-purpose representation model for\nspace is valuable for a multitude of tasks. However, no such general model\nexists to date beyond simply applying discretization or feed-forward nets to\ncoordinates, and little effort has been put into jointly modeling distributions\nwith vastly different characteristics, which commonly emerges from GIS data.\nMeanwhile, Nobel Prize-winning Neuroscience research shows that grid cells in\nmammals provide a multi-scale periodic representation that functions as a\nmetric for location encoding and is critical for recognizing places and for\npath-integration. Therefore, we propose a representation learning model called\nSpace2Vec to encode the absolute positions and spatial relationships of places.\nWe conduct experiments on two real-world geographic data for two different\ntasks: 1) predicting types of POIs given their positions and context, 2) image\nclassification leveraging their geo-locations. Results show that because of its\nmulti-scale representations, Space2Vec outperforms well-established ML\napproaches such as RBF kernels, multi-layer feed-forward nets, and tile\nembedding approaches for location modeling and image classification tasks.\nDetailed analysis shows that all baselines can at most well handle distribution\nat one scale but show poor performances in other scales.

In\nthis work we focus on the complementary problem: excessive prediction\nundersensitivity, where input text is meaningfully changed but the model's\nprediction does not, even though it should. We formulate a noisy adversarial\nattack which searches among semantic variations of the question for which a\nmodel erroneously predicts the same answer, and with even higher probability.\nDespite comprising unanswerable questions, both SQuAD2.0 and NewsQA models are\nvulnerable to this attack.
