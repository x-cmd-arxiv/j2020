In multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\nsetups, where multiple symbols are simultaneously transmitted, accurate symbol\ndetection is challenging. A family of algorithms capable of reliably recovering\nmultiple symbols is based on interference cancellation. However, these methods\nassume that the channel is linear, a model which does not reflect many relevant\nchannels, as well as require accurate channel state information (CSI), which\nmay not be available. In this work we propose a multiuser MIMO receiver which\nlearns to jointly detect in a data-driven fashion, without assuming a specific\nchannel model or requiring CSI. In particular, we propose a data-driven\nimplementation of the iterative soft interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm\nwhich we refer to as DeepSIC. The resulting symbol detector is based on\nintegrating dedicated machine-learning (ML) methods into the iterative SIC\nalgorithm. DeepSIC learns to carry out joint detection from a limited set of\ntraining samples without requiring the channel to be linear and its parameters\nto be known. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate that for linear channels\nwith full CSI, DeepSIC approaches the performance of iterative SIC, which is\ncomparable to the optimal performance, and outperforms previously proposed\nML-based MIMO receivers. Furthermore, in the presence of CSI uncertainty,\nDeepSIC significantly outperforms model-based approaches.

In this paper, we propose an ensemble of\nconvolutional neural networks (without a pooling layer) based on probability\nfusion for automated pavement crack detection and measurement. Specifically, an\nensemble of convolutional neural networks was employed to identify the\nstructure of small cracks with raw images.

To validate the\nproposed method, some experiments were performed on two public crack databases\n(CFD and AigleRN) and the results of the different state-of-the-art methods\nwere compared. The experimental results show that the proposed method\noutperforms the other methods.

It is\nessentially a survey, but some part, like most of the lengthy Section 5, is\ncomprised of new results whose proofs are unpublished elsewhere. We begin by\nreviewing the theory of real positivity of operator algebras initiated by the\nauthor and Charles Read. Then we present several new general results (mostly\njoint work with Matthew Neal) about real positive maps. The key point is that\nreal positivity is often the right replacement in a general algebra $A$ for\npositivity in C*-algebras. We then apply this to studying contractive\nprojections (`conditional expectations') and isometries of operator algebras.\nFor example we generalize and find variants of certain classical results on\npositive projections on C*-algebras and JB algebras due to Choi, Effros,\nSt{\\o}rmer, Friedman and Russo, and others. In previous work with Neal we had\ndone the `completely contractive' case; we focus here on describing the real\npositive contractive case from recent work with Neal.

Finally, in the last section we\ndescribe a related part of some recent joint work with Labuschagne on what we\nconsider to be a good noncommutative generalization of the `characters' (i.e.\nhomomorphisms into the scalars) on an algebra. Such characters are a special\ncase of the projections mentioned above, and are shown to be intimately related\nto conditional expectations.

The goal of TPP is to limit\nthe target disclosure by deleting a budget limited set of alternative\nnon-target links referred to as protectors to defend the adversarial link\npredictions for all targets. Traditional link privacy preserving treated all\nlinks as targets and concentrated on structural level protections in which\nserious link disclosure and high graph utility loss is still the bottleneck of\ngraph releasing today, while TPP focuses on the target level protections in\nwhich key protection is implemented on a tiny fraction of critical targets to\nachieve better privacy protection and lower graph utility loss. Currently there\nis a lack of clear TPP problem definition, provable optimal or near optimal\nprotector selection algorithms and scalable implementations on large-scale\nsocial graphs. Firstly, we introduce the TPP model and propose a dissimilarity\nfunction used for measuring the defense ability against privacy analyzing for\nthe targets. We consider two different problems by budget assignment settings:\n1) we protect all targets and to optimize the dissimilarity of all targets with\na single budget; 2) besides the protections of all targets, we also care about\nthe protection of each target by assigning a local budget to every target,\nconsidering two local protector selections. We also implement scalable\nimplementations and experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency\nof the proposed algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Feb 2020 05:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

Manipulation has two effects, the robot has a physical effect on\nthe object, and it also acquires information about the object. This thesis\npresents algorithms that treat both problems. First, I present an extension of\nthe well-known piano mover's problem where a robot pushing an object must plan\nits movements as well as those of the object. This requires simultaneous\nplanning in the joint space of the robot and the configuration space of the\nobject, in contrast to the original problem which only requires planning in the\nlatter space. The effects of a robot action on the object configuration are\ndetermined by the non-invertible rigid body mechanics. Second, I consider\nplanning under uncertainty and in particular planning for information effects.\nI consider the case where a robot has to reach and grasp an object under pose\nuncertainty caused by shape incompleteness. The approach presented in this\nreport is to study and possibly extend a new approach to artificial\nintelligence (A.I.) which has emerged in the last years in response to the\nnecessity of building intelligent controllers for agents operating in\nunstructured stochastic environments. Such agents require the ability to learn\nby interaction with its environment an optimal action-selection behaviour. The\nmain issue is that real-world problems are usually dynamic and unpredictable.\nThus, the agent needs to update constantly its current image of the world using\nits sensors, which provide only a noisy description of the surrounding\nenvironment. Although there are different schools of thinking, with their own\nset of techniques, a brand new direction which unifies many A.I. researches is\nto formalise such agent/environment interactions as embedded systems with\nstochastic dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Feb 2020 07:04:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 10:45:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 12:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

In the fine-level FHnet, we also design a facial\ncomponent-aware module that adopts the facial geometry guidance as clues to\naccurately align and merge the frontal coarse HR face and prior information.\nMeanwhile, two-level discriminators are designed to capture both the global\noutline of a face image as well as detailed facial characteristics. The\nCoarse-D enforces the coarsely hallucinated faces to be upright and complete\nwhile the Fine-D focuses on the fine hallucinated ones for sharper details.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our VividGAN achieves photo-realistic\nfrontal HR faces, reaching superior performance in downstream tasks, i.e., face\nrecognition and expression classification, compared with other state-of-the-art\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Feb 2020 07:33:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 03:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Designing\nlightweight networks is a possible solution, but it may degrade the recognition\nperformance. In this paper, we innovatively propose a general dynamic inference\nidea to improve inference efficiency by leveraging the variation in the\ndistinguishability of different videos. The dynamic inference approach can be\nachieved from aspects of the network depth and the number of input video\nframes, or even in a joint input-wise and network depth-wise manner. In a\nnutshell, we treat input frames and network depth of the computational graph as\na 2-dimensional grid, and several checkpoints are placed on this grid in\nadvance with a prediction module. The inference is carried out progressively on\nthe grid by following some predefined route, whenever the inference process\ncomes across a checkpoint, an early prediction can be made depending on whether\nthe early stop criteria meets. For the proof-of-concept purpose, we instantiate\nthree dynamic inference frameworks using two well-known backbone CNNs. In these\ninstances, we overcome the drawback of limited temporal coverage resulted from\nan early prediction by a novel frame permutation scheme, and alleviate the\nconflict between progressive computation and video temporal relation modeling\nby introducing an online temporal shift module.

Our solution,\nnamed Attention Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network (AP-CNN), consists of a) a\npyramidal hierarchy structure with a top-down feature pathway and a bottom-up\nattention pathway, and hence learns both high-level semantic and low-level\ndetailed feature representation, and b) an ROI guided refinement strategy with\nROI guided dropblock and ROI guided zoom-in, which refines features with\ndiscriminative local regions enhanced and background noises eliminated.

Recently, learning based image compression has achieved significant\nprogress by using the powerful representation ability from neural networks.\nHowever, the current state-of-the-art learning based image compression methods\nsuffer from the huge computational cost, which limits their capacity for\npractical applications. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called\nEfficient Deep Image Compression (EDIC) based on three new technologies,\nincluding a channel attention module, a Gaussian mixture model and a\ndecoder-side enhancement module. Specifically, we design an auto-encoder style\nnetwork for learning based image compression. To improve the coding efficiency,\nwe exploit the channel relationship between latent representations by using the\nchannel attention module. Besides, the Gaussian mixture model is introduced for\nthe entropy model and improves the accuracy for bitrate estimation.\nFurthermore, we introduce the decoder-side enhancement module to further\nimprove image compression performance. Our EDIC method can also be readily\nincorporated with the Deep Video Compression (DVC) framework to further improve\nthe video compression performance. Simultaneously, our EDIC method boosts the\ncoding performance significantly while bringing slightly increased\ncomputational cost. More importantly, experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art image compression\nmethods and is up to more than 150 times faster in terms of decoding speed when\ncompared with Minnen's method. The proposed framework also successfully\nimproves the performance of the recent deep video compression system DVC.

Its\ndecision process involves continuous derivation of valuable information from\nvarious data sources and sequential decision optimization, which is a\nprospective research direction for reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper,\nwe propose SARL, a novel State-Augmented RL framework for PM. Our framework\naims to address two unique challenges in financial PM: (1) data heterogeneity\n-- the collected information for each asset is usually diverse, noisy and\nimbalanced (e.g., news articles); and (2) environment uncertainty -- the\nfinancial market is versatile and non-stationary. To incorporate heterogeneous\ndata and enhance robustness against environment uncertainty, our SARL augments\nthe asset information with their price movement prediction as additional\nstates, where the prediction can be solely based on financial data (e.g., asset\nprices) or derived from alternative sources such as news. Experiments on two\nreal-world datasets, (i) Bitcoin market and (ii) HighTech stock market with\n7-year Reuters news articles, validate the effectiveness of SARL over existing\nPM approaches, both in terms of accumulated profits and risk-adjusted profits.\nMoreover, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the importance of\nour proposed state augmentation, providing new insights and boosting\nperformance significantly over standard RL-based PM method and other baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Feb 2020 08:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

A general\ntheoretical framework is developed by extending that of the classical\ncatastrophe machines made up of discrete elastic systems. The new formulation,\nbased on the nonlinear solution of the elastica, is enhanced by considering the\nconcept of the universal snap surface. Among the infinite set of elastica\ncatastrophe machines, two families are proposed and investigated to explicitly\nassess their features. The related catastrophe locus is disclosed in a large\nvariety of shapes, very different from those generated by the classical\ncounterpart. Substantial changes in the catastrophe locus properties, such as\nconvexity and number of bifurcation points, are achievable by tuning the design\nparameters of the proposed machines towards the design of very efficient\nsnapping devices. Experiments performed on the physical realization of the\nelastica catastrophe machine fully validate the present theoretical approach.\nThe developed model can find applications in mechanics at different scales, for\ninstance, in the design of new devices involving actuation or hysteresis loop\nmechanisms to achieve energy harvesting, locomotion, and wave mitigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Feb 2020 19:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}
