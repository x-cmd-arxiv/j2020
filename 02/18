We formulate the problem of\ndeceptive planning with decoy systems and other defenses as a two-player games\nwith asymmetrical information and Boolean payoffs in temporal logic.

Various continual\n(or \"incremental\") learning approaches have been proposed to avoid catastrophic\nforgetting, but they are typically adversary agnostic, i.e., they do not\nconsider the possibility of a malicious attack. In this effort, we explore the\nvulnerability of Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), a popular continual\nlearning algorithm for avoiding catastrophic forgetting. We show that an\nintelligent adversary can bypass the EWC's defenses, and instead cause gradual\nand deliberate forgetting by introducing small amounts of misinformation to the\nmodel during training. We demonstrate such an adversary's ability to assume\ncontrol of the model via injection of \"backdoor\" attack samples on both\npermuted and split benchmark variants of the MNIST dataset. Importantly, once\nthe model has learned the adversarial misinformation, the adversary can then\ncontrol the amount of forgetting of any task. Equivalently, the malicious actor\ncan create a \"false memory\" about any task by inserting carefully-designed\nbackdoor samples to any fraction of the test instances of that task. Perhaps\nmost damaging, we show this vulnerability to be very acute; neural network\nmemory can be easily compromised with the addition of backdoor samples into as\nlittle as 1% of the training data of even a single task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 18:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

METHODS We developed a modified stacked\nauto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics. We\napplied this model to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19\nacross China. The data were collected from January 11 to February 27, 2020 by\nWHO. We used the latent variables in the auto-encoder and clustering algorithms\nto group the provinces/cities for investigating the transmission structure.\nRESULTS We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across\nChina from Jan 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step forecasting,\nthe estimated average errors of 6-step, 7-step, 8-step, 9-step and 10-step\nforecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%, respectively.

However, the\nannotation process is exhaustive and time consuming, specially for large\ndatasets. Activities of Daily Living (ADL) recognition is an example of systems\nthat exploit very large raw sensor data readings. In such systems, sensor\nreadings are collected from activity-monitoring sensors in a 24/7 manner. The\nsize of the generated dataset is so huge that it is almost impossible for a\nhuman annotator to give a certain label to every single instance in the\ndataset. This results in annotation gaps in the input data to the adopting\nsupervised learning system. The performance of the recognition system is\nnegatively affected by these gaps. In this work, we propose and investigate\nthree different paradigms to handle these gaps. In the first paradigm, the gaps\nare taken out by dropping all unlabeled readings. A single \"Unknown\" or\n\"Do-Nothing\" label is given to the unlabeled readings within the operation of\nthe second paradigm. The last paradigm handles these gaps by giving every one\nof them a unique label identifying the encapsulating deterministic labels.\nAlso, we propose a semantic preprocessing method of annotation gaps by\nconstructing a hybrid combination of some of these paradigms for further\nperformance improvement. The performance of the proposed three paradigms and\ntheir hybrid combination is evaluated using an ADL benchmark dataset containing\nmore than $2.5\\times 10^6$ sensor readings that had been collected over more\nthan nine months. The evaluation results emphasize the performance contrast\nunder the operation of each paradigm and support a specific gap handling\napproach for better performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 18:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

We investigate the effect of angular\nmomentum on the geometry inside the event horizon, and see qualitative changes\nin the interior structure as a function of the spin parameter. For low spins,\nwe find that a central spacelike curvature singularity forms, connecting to a\nsingular, null Cauchy horizon.

However, as data sizes grow, traditional low-rank matrix approximation\nmethods, such as SVD and CPQR, are either prohibitively expensive or cannot\nprovide sufficiently accurate results. A solution is to use randomized low-rank\nmatrix approximation methods such as randomized SVD , and randomized LU\ndecomposition on extremely large data sets. In this paper, we focus on the\nrandomized LU decomposition method. First, we employ a reorthogonalization\nprocedure to perform the power iteration of the existing randomized LU\nalgorithm to compensate for the rounding errors caused by the power method.\nThen we propose a novel randomized LU algorithm, called PowerLU, for the fixed\nlow-rank approximation problem. PowerLU allows for an arbitrary number of\npasses of the input matrix, $v \\geq 2$. Recall that the existing randomized LU\ndecomposition only allows an even number of passes. We prove the theoretical\nrelationship between PowerLU and the existing randomized LU. Numerical\nexperiments show that our proposed PowerLU is generally faster than the\nexisting randomized LU decomposition, while remaining accurate. We also propose\na version of PowerLU, called PowerLU_FP, for the fixed precision low-rank\nmatrix approximation problem. PowerLU_FP is based on an efficient blocked\nadaptive rank determination Algorithm 4.1 proposed in this paper. We present\nnumerical experiments that show that PowerLU_FP can achieve almost the same\naccuracy and is faster than the randomized blocked QB algorithm by Martinsson\nand Voronin.

Tests show that the accuracy of our single-pass algorithm is\ncomparable with the existing single-pass algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 18:56:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

We study the stellar mass function (SMF) for\ngalaxies with $\\log(M_\\ast/M_\\odot)>10.3$ using a forward-modeling method that\nfully accounts for statistical and systematic uncertainties on stellar mass.\nFrom $z$=0.4 to 1.5 the massive end of the SMF shows minimal evolution in its\nshape: the characteristic mass ($M^\\ast$) evolves by less than 0.1 dex\n($\\pm$0.05 dex); the number density of galaxies with $\\log (M_\\ast/M_\\odot)\n>11$ stays roughly constant at $\\log (n/\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3})$ $\\simeq$ $-$3.4\n($\\pm$0.05), then declines to $\\log (n/\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3})$=$-$3.7 ($\\pm$0.05)\nat $z$=1.5. We discuss the uncertainties in the SMF, which are dominated by\nassumptions in the star formation history and details of stellar population\nsynthesis models for stellar mass estimations. For quiescent galaxies, the data\nare consistent with no (or slight) evolution ($\\lesssim0.1$ dex) in the\ncharacteristic mass nor number density from $z\\sim 1.5$ to the present. This\nimplies that any mass growth (presumably through \"dry\" mergers) of the\nquiescent massive galaxy population must balance the rate of mass losses from\nlate-stage stellar evolution and the formation of quenching galaxies from the\nstar-forming population. We provide a limit on this mass growth from $z=1.0$ to\n0.4 of $\\Delta M_\\ast/M_\\ast\\leq$ 45% (i.e., $\\simeq0.16$ dex) for quiescent\ngalaxies more massive than $10^{11}$ $M_\\odot$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel solution to address both of the aforementioned requirements, i.e., How to\nfind those tensor subspaces in which the signals of interest are highly\nseparable? and How to optimize the sensing and feature synthesis components to\ntransform the original signals to the data manifold found in the first\nquestion? In our proposal, the discovery of a high-quality data manifold is\nconducted by training a nonlinear compressive learning system on the inference\ntask. Its knowledge of the data manifold of interest is then progressively\ntransferred to the MCL components via multi-stage supervised training with the\nsupervisory information encoding how the compressed measurements, the\nsynthesized features, and the predictions should be like. The proposed\nknowledge transfer algorithm also comes with a semi-supervised adaption that\nenables compressive learning models to utilize unlabeled data effectively.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed knowledge transfer method\ncan effectively train MCL models to compressively sense and synthesize better\nfeatures for the learning tasks with improved performances, especially when the\ncomplexity of the learning task increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 19:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

In this study, we provide a better\nunderstanding of what drives massive star evolution to blue and red supergiant\nphases, with the ultimate aim of reproducing the HD limit at varied\nmetallicities (Z). For solar, LMC, and SMC Z, we develop eight grids of MESA\nmodels for the mass range 20-60M to probe the effect of semiconvection and\novershooting. We compare rotating and non-rotating models with efficient\n(alpha_semi = 100) and inefficient semi-convection (alpha_semi = 0.1), with\nhigh and low core overshooting (alpha_ov of 0.1 or 0.5). The red and blue\nsupergiant evolutionary phases are investigated by comparing the fraction of\ncore He-burning lifetimes spent in each phase. We find that the extension of\nthe convective core by overshooting alpha_ov = 0.5 has an effect on the post-MS\nevolution which can disable semiconvection leading to more RSGs, but a lack of\nBSGs. We therefore implement alpha_ov = 0.1 which switches on semiconvective\nmixing, though for standard alpha_semi = 1, would result in an HD limit which\nis higher than observed at low Z. Therefore, we need to implement very\nefficient semiconvection of alpha_semi = 100 which reproduces the HD limit at\nlog L ~ 5.5 for the Magellanic Clouds while simultaneously reproducing the\nGalactic HD limit of log L ~ 5.8 naturally. The effect of semiconvection is not\nactive at high Z due to the depletion of the envelope structure by strong mass\nloss such that semiconvective regions could not form. Z-dependent mass loss\nplays an indirect, yet decisive role in setting the HD limit as a function of\nZ. For a combination of efficient semiconvection and low overshooting with\nstandard Z-dependent mass loss, we find a natural HD limit at all\nmetallicities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 19:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

In this paper, we address several\ntechnical challenges towards its practical implementation for beyond 5G\nsystems. To this end, we focus on a single-cell system with a multi-antenna\nbase station (BS) and K single-antenna receivers. We consider RS in its most\ngeneral form, and joint decoding to fully exploit the potential of RS. First,\nwe investigate the achievable rates under joint decoding and formulate the\nprecoder design problems to maximize a general utility function, or to minimize\nthe transmit power under pre-defined rate targets. Building upon the\nconcave-convex procedure (CCCP), we propose precoder design algorithms for an\narbitrary number of users. Our proposed algorithms approximate the intractable\nnon-convex problems with a number of successively refined convex problems, and\nprovably converge to stationary points of the original problems. Then, to\nreduce the decoding complexity, we consider the optimization of the precoder\nand the decoding order under successive decoding. Further, we propose a stream\nselection algorithm to reduce the number of precoded signals. With a reduced\nnumber of streams and successive decoding at the receivers, our proposed\nalgorithm can even be implemented when the number of users is relatively large,\nwhereas the complexity was previously considered as prohibitively high in the\nsame setting. Finally, we propose a simple adaptation of our algorithms to\naccount for the imperfection of the channel state information at the\ntransmitter. Numerical results demonstrate that the general RS scheme provides\na substantial performance gain as compared to state-of-the-art linear precoding\nschemes, especially with a moderately large number of users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 19:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

In this paper, we present a novel Dual-Attention\nGenerative Adversarial Network (DA-GAN) for photo-realistic face frontalization\nby capturing both contextual dependencies and local consistency during GAN\ntraining. Specifically, a self-attention-based generator is introduced to\nintegrate local features with their long-range dependencies yielding better\nfeature representations, and hence generate faces that preserve identities\nbetter, especially for larger pose angles. Moreover, a novel\nface-attention-based discriminator is applied to emphasize local features of\nface regions, and hence reinforce the realism of synthetic frontal faces.\nGuided by semantic segmentation, four independent discriminators are used to\ndistinguish between different aspects of a face (\\ie skin, keypoints, hairline,\nand frontalized face). By introducing these two complementary attention\nmechanisms in generator and discriminator separately, we can learn a richer\nfeature representation and generate identity preserving inference of frontal\nviews with much finer details (i.e., more accurate facial appearance and\ntextures) comparing to the state-of-the-art.

Zapartas et al. (2019) modeled the\nfraction of hydrogen-rich, Type II SN progenitors which have their evolution\naffected by mass exchange with their companion, finding this to be between 1/3\nand 1/2 for most assumptions. Here we study in more depth the impact of this\nbinary history of Type II SN progenitors on their final pre-SN core mass\ndistribution, using population synthesis simulations. We find that binary star\nprogenitors of Type II SNe typically end their life with a larger core mass\nthan they would have had if they had lived in isolation, because they gained\nmass or merged with a companion before explosion. The combination of the\ndiverse binary evolutionary paths typically lead to a marginally shallower\nfinal core mass distribution. Discussing our results in the context of the red\nsupergiant problem, i.e., the reported lack of detected high luminosity\nprogenitors, we conclude that binary evolution does not seem to significantly\naffect the issue. This conclusion is quite robust against our variations in the\nassumptions of binary physics. We also predict that inferring the initial\nmasses of Type II SN progenitors from \"age-dating\" its surrounding environment\nsystematically yields lower masses compared to methods that probe the pre-SN\ncore mass or luminosity. A robust discrepancy between the inferred initial\nmasses of a SN progenitor from those different techniques could indicate an\nevolutionary history of binary mass accretion or merging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 20:07:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 17:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

Given this interpretation, it is natural to evaluate\nsequence-to-sequence models using conditional log-likelihood on a test set.\nHowever, the goal of sequence-to-sequence generation (or structured prediction)\nis to find the best output y^ given an input x, and each task has its own\ndownstream metric R that scores a model output by comparing against a set of\nreferences y*: R(y^, y* | x).

These dual requirements may be satisfied by collisionless\nrelativistic magnetic reconnection. On the one hand, relativistic reconnection\ncan energize gamma-ray emitting electrons. On the other, as previous kinetic\nsimulations have shown, the reconnection acceleration mechanism preferentially\nfocuses high-energy particles -- and their emitted photons -- into beams, which\nmay create rapid blips in flux as they cross a telescope's line of sight. Using\na series of 2D pair-plasma particle-in-cell simulations, we explicitly\ndemonstrate the critical role played by radiative cooling in mediating the\nobservable signatures of this `kinetic beaming' effect. Only in our efficiently\ncooled simulations do we measure kinetic beaming beyond one light crossing time\nof the reconnection layer. We find a correlation between the cooling strength\nand the photon energy range across which persistent kinetic beaming occurs:\nstronger cooling coincides with a wider range of beamed photon energies. We\nalso apply our results to rapid gamma-ray flares in flat-spectrum radio\nquasars, suggesting that a paradigm of radiatively efficient kinetic beaming\nconstrains relevant emission models. In particular, beaming-produced\nvariability may be more easily realized in two-zone (e.g. spine-sheath)\nset-ups, with Compton seed photons originating in the jet itself, rather than\nin one-zone external Compton scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 20:50:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 04:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

As a specific example, in traditional modeling techniques that use\nelectric enthalpy density with higher-order terms, it can be problematic to\nchoose which polynomial nonlinearities are essential. This paper introduces\nadaptive estimator techniques to estimate the nonlinearities that can arise in\ncertain piezoelectric systems.

Unlike traditional modeling approaches, the approach discussed in\nthis paper allows the development of models without knowledge of the precise\nform or structure of the nonlinearity.

The technique is based on the use of wide-field cameras operating in\na drift scanning mode, whereby persistent objects produce trails on the sensor\nand short duration transients occupy localised groups of pixels. A benefit of\nthe technique is that sensitivity to short duration signals is not accompanied\nby massive data rates, because the exposure time >> transient duration. The\ntechnique is demonstrated using a pre-prototype system composed of readily\navailable and inexpensive commercial components, coupled with common coding\nenvironments, commercially available software, and free web-based services. The\nperformance of the technique and the pre-prototype system is explored,\nincluding aspects of photometric and astrometric calibration, detection\nsensitivity, characterisation of candidate transients, and the differentiation\nof astronomical signals from non-astronomical signals (primarily glints from\nsatellites in Earth orbit and cosmic ray hits on sensor pixels). Test\nobservations were made using the pre-prototype system, achieving sensitivity to\ntransients with 21 ms duration, resulting in the detection of five candidate\ntransients. An investigation of these candidates concludes they are most likely\ndue to cosmic ray hits on the sensor and/or satellites. The sensitivity\nobtained with the pre-prototype system is such that, under some models for the\noptical emission from FRBs, the detection of a typical FRB, such as FRB181228,\nto a distance of approximately 100 Mpc is plausible.

The scientific goals of WALLABY include: (a) a\ncensus of gas-rich galaxies in the vicinity of the Local Group; (b) a study of\nthe HI properties of galaxies, groups and clusters, in particular the influence\nof the environment on galaxy evolution; and (c) the refinement of cosmological\nparameters using the spatial and redshift distribution of low-bias gas-rich\ngalaxies. For context we provide an overview of previous large-scale HI\nsurveys. Combined with existing and new multi-wavelength sky surveys, WALLABY\nwill enable an exciting new generation of panchromatic studies of the Local\nUniverse. - First results from the WALLABY pilot survey are revealed, with\ninitial data products publicly available in the CSIRO ASKAP Science Data\nArchive (CASDA).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 00:34:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 05:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

With fluid-immersed particles confined in a fixed\nvolume and forced to \"flow\" at viscous numbers $J$ decades below reported\nvalues, we answer how a granular system can transition to the regime sustained\nby solid-to-solid friction that goes beyond existing paradigms based on\nsuspension rheology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 01:45:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 23:51:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 02:28:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 23:54:07 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 05:58:39 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 09:35:13 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 02:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

These methods,\nalbeit practical, have been proven vulnerable against multi-antenna\neavesdroppers who can filter the message from the noise. The vulnerability is\nrooted in the fact that the main channel state remains static in spite of the\nnoise injection, which allows an eavesdropper to estimate it promptly via known\nsymbols and filter out the noise. Our proposed scheme leverages a\nreconfigurable antenna for Alice to rapidly change the channel state during\ntransmission and a compressive sensing based algorithm for her to predict and\ncancel the changing effects for Bob. As a result, the communication between\nAlice and Bob remains clear, whereas randomized channel state prevents Eve from\nlaunching the known-plaintext attack. We formally analyze the security of the\nscheme against both single and multi-antenna eavesdroppers and identify its\nunique anti-eavesdropping properties due to the artificially created\nfast-changing channel.

State-of-the-art solutions for TAL involves\nevaluating the frame-level probabilities of three action-indicating phases,\ni.e. starting, continuing, and ending; and then post-processing these\npredictions for the final localization. This paper delves deep into this\nmechanism, and argues that existing methods, by modeling these phases as\nindividual classification tasks, ignored the potential temporal constraints\nbetween them. This can lead to incorrect and/or inconsistent predictions when\nsome frames of the video input lack sufficient discriminative information. To\nalleviate this problem, we introduce two regularization terms to mutually\nregularize the learning procedure: the Intra-phase Consistency (IntraC)\nregularization is proposed to make the predictions verified inside each phase;\nand the Inter-phase Consistency (InterC) regularization is proposed to keep\nconsistency between these phases.

The code\nimplements two types of well established QMC algorithms: Variational Monte\nCarlo (VMC), and Diffusion Monte Carlo in its robust and efficient lattice\nregularized variant. A key feature of the code is the possibility of using\nstrongly correlated many-body wave functions. The electronic wave function (WF)\nis obtained by applying a Jastrow factor, which takes into account dynamical\ncorrelations, to the most general mean-field ground state, written either as an\nantisymmetrized geminal product with spin-singlet pairing, or as a Pfaffian,\nincluding both singlet and triplet correlations. This wave function can be\nviewed as an efficient implementation of the so-called resonating valence bond\n(RVB) ansatz, first proposed by L. Pauling and P. W. Anderson in quantum\nchemistry and condensed matter physics, respectively. The RVB ansatz\nimplemented in TurboRVB has a large variational freedom, including the Jastrow\ncorrelated Slater determinant as its simplest, but nontrivial case. Moreover,\nit has the remarkable advantage of remaining with an affordable computational\ncost, proportional to the one spent for the evaluation of a single Slater\ndeterminant. The code implements the adjoint algorithmic differentiation that\nenables a very efficient evaluation of energy derivatives, comprising the ionic\nforces. Thus, one can perform structural optimizations and molecular dynamics\nin the canonical NVT ensemble at the VMC level. For the electronic part, a full\nWF optimization is made possible thanks to state-of-the-art stochastic\nalgorithms for energy minimization. The code has been efficiently parallelized\nby using a hybrid MPI-OpenMP protocol, that is also an ideal environment for\nexploiting the computational power of modern GPU accelerators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 06:44:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 10:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

GPNM has become\nincreasingly important in many applications, e.g., group finding and expert\nrecommendation. In real scenarios, both GP and GD are updated frequently.\nHowever, the existing GPNM methods either need to perform a new GPNM procedure\nfrom scratch to deliver the node matching results based on the updated GP and\nGD or incrementally perform the GPNM procedure for each of the updates, leading\nto low efficiency. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a new method to\nefficiently deliver the node matching results on the updated graphs. In this\npaper, we first analyze and detect the elimination relationships between the\nupdates. Then, we construct an Elimination Hierarchy Tree (EH-Tree) to index\nthese elimination relationships. In order to speed up the GPNM process, we\npropose a graph partition method and then propose a new updates-aware GPNM\nmethod, called UA-GPNM, considering the single-graph elimination relationships\namong the updates in a single graph of GP or GD, and also the cross-graph\nelimination relationships between the updates in GP and the updates in GD.\nUA-GPNM first delivers the GPNM result of an initial query, and then delivers\nthe GPNM result of a subsequent query, based on the initial GPNM result and the\nmultiple updates that occur between two queries. The experimental results on\nfive real-world social graphs demonstrate that our proposed UA-GPNM is much\nmore efficient than the state-of-the-art GPNM methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 06:44:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Then an Intra-Domain Reasoning Module\nlearns and propagates the sparse graph representation within one dataset guided\nby a spatial-aware GCN. Finally, an InterDomain Transfer Module is proposed to\nexploit diverse transfer dependencies across all domains and enhance the\nregional feature representation by attending and transferring semantic contexts\nglobally. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method\nsignificantly outperforms multiple-branch models and achieves the\nstate-of-the-art results on multiple object detection benchmarks (mAP: 49.1% on\nCOCO).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 07:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Moreover, the unknown statistics (amplitude, distribution)\nrelated to this noise make it difficult to estimate the false alarm probability\n(FAP) for exoplanet detection tests. In this paper, we investigate the\npossibility of using 3D magneto-hydrodynamical simulations (MHD) of stellar\nconvection to design detection methods that can provide both a reliable\nestimate of the FAP and a high detection power. We tested the realism of 3D\nsimulations in producing solar RV by comparing them with the observed disk\nintegrated velocities taken by the GOLF instrument on board the SOHO\nspacecraft. We presented a new detection method based on periodograms\nstandardized by these simulated time series, applying several detection tests\nto these standarized periodograms. The power spectral density of the 3D\nsynthetic convective noise is consistent with solar RV observations for short\nperiods. For regularly sampled observations, the analytic expressions of FAP\nderived for several statistical tests applied to the periodogram standardized\nby 3D simulation noise are accurate. The adaptive tests considered in this work\n(Higher-Criticism, Berk-Jones), which are new in the exoplanet field, may offer\nbetter detection performance than classical tests (based on the highest\nperiodogram value) in the case of multi-planetary systems and planets with\neccentric orbits. 3D MHD simulations are now mature enough to produce reliable\nsynthetic time series of the convective noise affecting RV data. These series\ncan be used to access to the statistics of this noise and derive accurate FAP\nof tests that are a critical element in the detection of exoplanets down to the\ncm/s level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 09:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

To this end, this paper consider the\nmulti-view registration problem as a maximum likelihood estimation problem and\nproposes a novel multi-view registration approach under the perspective of\nExpectation-Maximization (EM). The basic idea of our approach is that different\ndata points are generated by the same number of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs).\nFor each data point in one point set, its nearest neighbors can be searched\nfrom other well-aligned point sets.

In this paper we demonstrate an approach\nthat abstracts collection and processing of such secondary information from the\nrunning R script. Our approach is based on a combination of three elements. The\nfirst element is to build a customized way to evaluate code. The second is\nlabeled \\emph{local masking} and it involves temporarily masking auser-facing\nfunction so an alternative version of it is called. The third element we label\n\\emph{local side effect}. This refers to the fact that the masking function\nexports information to the secondary information flow without altering a global\nstate. The result is a method for building systems in pure R that lets users\ncreate and control secondary flows of information with minimal impact on their\nworkflow, and no global side effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 10:23:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 15:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

This so-called Wilson depression is\ncaused by the Lorentz force of the strong magnetic field inside the spots.\nHowever, it is not understood in detail yet, how the Wilson depression is\nrelated to the strength and geometry of the magnetic field or to other\nproperties of the sunspot.\n  Aims: We aim to study the dependence of the Wilson depression on the\nproperties of the magnetic field of the sunspots and how exactly the magnetic\nfield contributes to balancing the Wilson depression with respect to the gas\npressure of the surroundings of the spots.\n  Methods: Our study is based on 24 spectropolarimetric scans of 12 individual\nsunspots performed with Hinode. We derived the Wilson depression for each spot\nusing both, a recently developed method that is based on minimizing the\ndivergence of the magnetic field, and an approach developed earlier that\nenforces an equilibrium between the gas pressure and the magnetic pressure\ninside the spot and the gas pressure in the quiet Sun, thus neglecting the\ninfluence of the curvature force. We then performed a statistical analysis by\ncomparing the Wilson depression resulting from the two techniques with each\nother and by relating them to various parameters of the sunspots, such as their\nsize or the strength of the magnetic field.\n  Results: We find that the Wilson depression becomes larger for spots with a\nstronger magnetic field, but not as much as one would expect from the increased\nmagnetic pressure. This suggests that the curvature integral provides an\nimportant contribution to the Wilson depression, particularly for spots with a\nweak magnetic field.

The number of edge states isolated from the continuous bulk bands\nin the complex energy plane is successfully linked with a topological invariant\nconstructed from MSR. Specifically, the number of isolated edge states can be\nobtained from a winding number defined for the Majorana stars, which also\nallows for a geometric visualization of the topology related to the isolated\nedge modes. A remarkable success of our approach is that our winding number\ncharacterization remains valid even in the presence of exceptional points of\nthe continuous bulk bands, where the Hamiltonian becomes non-diagonalizable and\nhence conventional topological invariants such as the Zak phase and the Chern\nnumber cannot be properly defined. Furthermore, cases with the so-called\nnon-Hermitian skin effect are also studied, showing that the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence between our defined winding numbers and isolated edge states can\nbe restored. Of particular interest is a four-band example with an odd number\nof isolated edge states, where the Zak phase approach necessarily fails upon\nremoving the skin effect, but our MSR-based characterization works equally\nwell. For these reasons, our study is expected to be widely useful in\ntopological studies of non-Hermitian multiband systems, regardless of the skin\neffect or the presence of the exceptional points in non-Hermitian systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 11:15:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 02:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

While many such\nmodels exist, they often use manually constructed features based on restricted,\nlocally available data. Thus, they are typically hard to reproduce and\nchallenging to adapt to areas beyond those they have been developed for. In\nthis paper, we advocate a paradigm shift for LUR models: We propose the\nData-driven, Open, Global (DOG) paradigm that entails models based on purely\ndata-driven approaches using only openly and globally available data. Progress\nwithin this paradigm will alleviate the need for experts to adapt models to the\nlocal characteristics of the available data sources and thus facilitate the\ngeneralizability of air pollution models to new areas on a global scale. In\norder to illustrate the feasibility of the DOG paradigm for LUR, we introduce a\ndeep learning model called MapLUR. It is based on a convolutional neural\nnetwork architecture and is trained exclusively on globally and openly\navailable map data without requiring manual feature engineering. We compare our\nmodel to state-of-the-art baselines like linear regression, random forests and\nmulti-layer perceptrons using a large data set of modeled $\\text{NO}_2$\nconcentrations in Central London. Our results show that MapLUR significantly\noutperforms these approaches even though they are provided with manually\ntailored features. Furthermore, we illustrate that the automatic feature\nextraction inherent to models based on the DOG paradigm can learn features that\nare readily interpretable and closely resemble those commonly used in\ntraditional LUR approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 11:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-05"}

Furthermore, the maximum of the DYN-estimated temperatures\nis found at much higher altitudes over the polar regions and coronal holes,\nthan over the equator.

A high frequency oscillation of the magnetics and the\ndensity at the pedestal is also associated with both the M-mode and the\nI-phase, and its power is modulated with the LFO frequency. The power\nmodulation happens simultaneously in every Mirnov coil signal where it can be\ndetected.

In order to meet the new\nrequirements, intelligent distributed energy resource plants can be used which\nprovide as virtual power plants e.g. demand side management or flexible\ngeneration. However, the calculation of an adequate schedule for the unit\ncommitment of such distributed energy resources is a complex optimization\nproblem which is typically too complex for standard optimization algorithms if\nlarge numbers of distributed energy resources are considered.

Here we examine the\nvalidity of this proposal by adopting the point of view of archaic cosmology,\nbased on de Sitter projective relativity, with an event-based reading of\nquantum mechanics, which is a consequence of the relationship between the\nuniversal information reservoir of the archaic universe and its\nout-of-equilibrium state through quantum jumps.

Totally 42 content features in two categories\n\"importance\" (28 features) and \"ambiguity\" (14 features) are introduced to\ncompute SPR. The proposed model is evaluated on two datasets, Twitter and\nTelegram. The results showed that (i) the spread power of False Rumor documents\nis rarely more than True Rumors.

The universality of this behavior indicates that\ndespite social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical\nheterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by\nfundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological\nmodels. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of\ncontainment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population.

Quantitative fits to empirical data permit\nthe identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or\noligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of\nlocal variations in the basic reproduction number.

For\nexample, $k$-cores are commonly used to model the unraveling phenomena in\nsocial networks. In this model, users having less than $k$ connections within\nthe network leave it, so the remaining users form exactly the $k$-core. In this\npaper we study the question whether it is possible to make the network more\nrobust by spending only a limited amount of resources on new connections. A\nmathematical model for the $k$-core construction problem is the following Edge\n$k$-Core optimization problem. We are given a graph $G$ and integers $k$, $b$\nand $p$. The task is to ensure that the $k$-core of $G$ has at least $p$\nvertices by adding at most $b$ edges.\n  The previous studies on Edge $k$-Core demonstrate that the problem is\ncomputationally challenging. In particular, it is NP-hard when $k=3$, W[1]-hard\nbeing parameterized by $k+b+p$ (Chitnis and Talmon, 2018), and APX-hard (Zhou\net al, 2019). Nevertheless, we show that there are efficient algorithms with\nprovable guarantee when the $k$-core has to be constructed from a sparse graph\nwith some additional structural properties. Our results are 1) When the input\ngraph is a forest, Edge $k$-Core is solvable in polynomial time; 2) Edge\n$k$-Core is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) being parameterized by the minimum\nsize of a vertex cover in the input graph. On the other hand, with such\nparameterization, the problem does not admit a polynomial kernel subject to a\nwidely-believed assumption from complexity theory; 3) Edge $k$-Core is FPT\nparameterized by $\\mathrm{tw}+k$.

Even in times when physical borders separated the scientific\ncommunity, scientists kept their minds open to the ideas created beyond the\nwalls and tried to communicate despite all the obstacles. An example of such\nactivities in the field of physics is the travel in the year 1838 of a group of\nthree scientists through the Western Europe: Andreas Ettingshausen (professor\nat the University of Vienna), August Kunzek (professor at the University of\nLviv) and P. Marian Koller (director of the observatory in Chremsminster, Upper\nAustria). 155 years later a vivid scientific exchange began between physicists\nfrom Austria and Ukraine, in particular, between the Institute for Condensed\nMatter Physics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Lviv and the\nInstitute for Theoretical Physics of Johannes Kepler University Linz. This\nbecame possible due to the programs financed by national institutions, but it\nhad its scientific background in already knotted historic scientific networks,\nwhen Lviv was an international center of mathematics and in Vienna the 'School\nof Statistical Thought' arose. Due to the new collaboration, after the breakup\nof the Soviet Union, Ukraine became the first country to join the Middle\nEuropean Cooperation in Statistical Physics (MECO) founded in the early 1970s\nwith the aim of bridging the gap between scientists from the Eastern and\nWestern parts of Europe separated by the iron curtain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 14:59:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 15:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

By exploiting this low-rank prior with application to multiplicative\nnoise removal, we propose a nonlocal low-rank model for this task and develop a\nproximal alternating reweighted minimization (PARM) algorithm to solve the\noptimization problem resulting from the model. Specifically, we utilize a\ngeneralized nonconvex surrogate of the rank function to regularize the patch\nmatrices and develop a new nonlocal low-rank model, which is a nonconvex\nnonsmooth optimization problem having a patchwise data fidelity and a\ngeneralized nonlocal low-rank regularization term.

When a microchannel is engraved a rotating compact\ndisc (CD) based device, the centrifugal force acts as the driving force that\nactuates the flow and the Coriolis force enhances the mixing process in\nsignificantly short span by destabilizing the flow. An OrrSommerfeld-Squire\nanalysis is performed to explore the role of these forces on the linear\nstability of rotating shear-thinning flow. Reported results on shear thinning\nflow with streamwise disturbances indicate that the critical Reynolds number\nfor the flow transition with viscosity perturbation is nearly half of that of\nthe critical value for the same without viscosity perturbation. In sharp\ncontrast, the present analysis considering spanwise disturbances reveals that\nthe critical Reynolds numbers with and without viscosity perturbation remain\nvirtually unaltered under rotational effects. However, the viscosity variation\nhas no significant influence on the Coriolis force-based instability. Numerical\nresults confirm that a momentous destabilization is possible by aid of the\nCoriolis force via generating secondary flow inside the channel. Interestingly,\nthe roll cells corresponding to the instabilities at lower time constants\nexhibit the existence of two distinct vortices, and the centre of the stronger\none is essentially settled towards the unstable stratified region.

Our first application to gravitational waves\nuses an autoregressive flow, conditioned on detector strain data, to map a\nmultivariate standard normal distribution into the posterior distribution over\nsystem parameters. We train the model on artificial strain data consisting of\nIMRPhenomPv2 waveforms drawn from a five-parameter $(m_1, m_2, \\phi_0, t_c,\nd_L)$ prior and stationary Gaussian noise realizations with a fixed power\nspectral density.

In flares,\nelectron beams are thought to be the primary energy transport mechanism,\ndriving strong footpoint heating during the impulsive phase that causes\nevaporation, filling and heating flare loops.

We make the first step towards developing that theory\nby proving that the reduced $SU_3$-skein algebra of any surface of finite type\nis finitely generated.\n  We achieve that result by developing a theory of canonical forms of webs in\nsurfaces. Specifically, we show that for any ideal triangulation of $F$ every\nreduced $3$-web can be uniquely decomposed into unions of pyramid formations of\nhexagons and disjoint arcs in the faces of the triangulation with possible\nadditional \"crossbars\" connecting their edges along the ideal triangulation. We\nshow that such canonical position is unique up to \"crossbar moves\". That leads\nus to an associated system of coordinates for webs in triangulated surfaces\n(counting intersections of the web with the edges of the triangulation and\ntheir rotation numbers inside of the faces of the triangulation) which\ndetermine a reduced web uniquely.\n  Finally, we relate our skein algebras to $\\cal A$-varieties of Fock-Goncharov\nand to $\\text{Loc}_{SL(3)}$-varieties of Goncharov-Shen.

The physics constraints are embedded\nin the loss function to enforce the model training which can accurately capture\nlatent system nonlinearity even with very limited available training datasets.\nSpecifically for dynamic structures, physical laws of equation of motion, state\ndependency and hysteretic constitutive relationship are considered to construct\nthe physics loss.

The chatbot and the entire\nconversational AI system are developed using open-source tools, and deployed\nwithin our company's intranet. The proposed approach can be useful for\nindustries seeking similar in-house solutions in their specific business\ndomains. We share all our code and a sample chatbot built on a public dataset\non Github.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 18:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}

This work\nimplements a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DC-GAN) for\ngenerating realistic n-phase microstructural data. The same network\narchitecture is successfully applied to two very different three-phase\nmicrostructures: A lithium-ion battery cathode and a solid oxide fuel cell\nanode. A comparison between the real and synthetic data is performed in terms\nof the morphological properties (volume fraction, specific surface area,\ntriple-phase boundary) and transport properties (relative diffusivity), as well\nas the two-point correlation function. The results show excellent agreement\nbetween for datasets and they are also visually indistinguishable. By modifying\nthe input to the generator, we show that it is possible to generate\nmicrostructure with periodic boundaries in all three directions. This has the\npotential to significantly reduce the simulated volume required to be\nconsidered representative and therefore massively reduce the computational cost\nof the electrochemical simulations necessary to predict the performance of a\nparticular microstructure during optimisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 17:38:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 21:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}
