OML includes multi-armed\nbandit (MAB) algorithms that can identify the best arm among several arms by\nachieving a balance between exploration of all arms and exploitation of optimal\narm. The Kullback-Leibler divergence based upper confidence bound (KLUCB) is\nthe state-of-the-art MAB algorithm that optimizes exploration-exploitation\ntrade-off but it is complex due to underlining optimization routine. This\nlimits its usefulness for robotics and radio applications which demand\nintegration of KLUCB with the PHY on the system on chip (SoC). In this paper,\nwe efficiently map the KLUCB algorithm on SoC by realizing optimization routine\nvia alternative synthesizable computation without compromising on the\nperformance. The proposed architecture is dynamically reconfigurable such that\nthe number of arms, as well as type of algorithm, can be changed on-the-fly.\nSpecifically, after initial learning, on-the-fly switch to light-weight UCB\noffers around 10-factor improvement in latency and throughput. Since learning\nduration depends on the unknown arm statistics, we offer intelligence embedded\nin architecture to decide the switching instant.

We posit that, in terms of phenomenological analysis of\nconsciousness, the temporal aspect, and this apparent conflict in particular,\nmight be the most basic property, likely inherent to any conceivable form of\nconsciousness. It is then outlined how taking this perspective offers a\nconcrete way of relating the properties of consciousness directly to the neural\nplasticity mechanisms of learning and memory, and specifying how exactly\nsubjective experience might be related to processes of information integration.\nIn particular, we propose synaptic clock to constitute a content-specific\nneural substrate of consciousness, explaining how it would correspond to this\ntemporal aspect. Then, we propose a viewpoint, in which moments of subjective\ntime have different durations, depending on the type of information processed,\nproportional to the time units of corresponding synaptic clocks, and being in\nprinciple different for different brain regions and nervous systems in\ndifferent animal species. Relation and possible contributions of this viewpoint\nto the extensional model of time consciousness are discussed.

Perfect quantum computers are unarguably\nexponentially difficult to simulate: the classical resources required grow\nexponentially with the number of qubits $N$ or the depth $D$ of the circuit.\nReal quantum computing devices, however, are characterized by an exponentially\ndecaying fidelity $\\mathcal{F} \\sim (1-\\epsilon)^{ND}$ with an error rate\n$\\epsilon$ per operation as small as $\\approx 1\\%$ for current devices. In this\nwork, we demonstrate that real quantum computers can be simulated at a tiny\nfraction of the cost that would be needed for a perfect quantum computer. Our\nalgorithms compress the representations of quantum wavefunctions using matrix\nproduct states (MPS), which capture states with low to moderate entanglement\nvery accurately. This compression introduces a finite error rate $\\epsilon$ so\nthat the algorithms closely mimic the behavior of real quantum computing\ndevices. The computing time of our algorithm increases only linearly with $N$\nand $D$. We illustrate our algorithms with simulations of random circuits for\nqubits connected in both one and two dimensional lattices. We find that\n$\\epsilon$ can be decreased at a polynomial cost in computing power down to a\nminimum error $\\epsilon_\\infty$. Getting below $\\epsilon_\\infty$ requires\ncomputing resources that increase exponentially with\n$\\epsilon_\\infty/\\epsilon$. For a two dimensional array of $N=54$ qubits and a\ncircuit with Control-Z gates, error rates better than state-of-the-art devices\ncan be obtained on a laptop in a few hours. For more complex gates such as a\nswap gate followed by a controlled rotation, the error rate increases by a\nfactor three for similar computing time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 17:00:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 16:25:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-26"}

This problem has been studied\nextensively in the data-mining community and it has multiple applications\nincluding influence maximization in social networks, team formation and\nrecommender systems. A particularly popular formulation that captures the needs\nof many such applications is one where the objective function $f$ is a monotone\nand non-negative submodular function. In these cases, the corresponding\ncomputational problem can be solved using a simple greedy\n$(1-\\frac{1}{e})$-approximation algorithm.\n  In this paper, we consider a generalization of the above formulation where\nthe goal is to optimize a function that maximizes the submodular function $f$\nminus a linear cost function $c$. This formulation appears as a more natural\none, particularly when one needs to strike a balance between the value of the\nobjective function and the cost being paid in order to pick the selected\nelements. We address variants of this problem both in an offline setting, where\nthe collection is known a priori, as well as in online settings, where the\nelements of the collection arrive in an online fashion. We demonstrate that by\nusing simple variants of the standard greedy algorithm (used for submodular\noptimization) we can design algorithms that have provable approximation\nguarantees, are extremely efficient and work very well in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 18:26:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 17:08:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 14:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

The goal\nof this pilot study is to present a method that will identify galaxies that are\nundergoing a strong variation of star formation activity in the last tens to\nhundreds Myr. In other words, the proposed method will determine whether a\nvariation in the last few hundreds of Myr of the SFH is needed to properly\nmodel the SED rather than a smooth normal SFH. To do so, we analyze a sample of\nCOSMOS galaxies using high signal-to-noise ratio broad band photometry.

High-excitation radio galaxies\n(HERGs) with intermediate radio powers (22.5 $<$ log(L$_{\\rm 1.4GHz}$) $<$ 25.0\nW Hz$^{-1}$) form an important sub-group of this population, since there is\nstrong evidence that they also drive multi-phase outflows on the scales of\ngalaxy bulges. Here, we present high-resolution VLA observations at 1.5, 4.5\nand 7.5 GHz of a sample of 16 such HERGs in the local universe ($z<0.1$),\nconducted in order to investigate the morphology, extent and spectra of their\nradio emission in detail, down to sub-kpc scales. We find that the majority (56\nper cent) have unresolved structures at the limiting angular resolution of the\nobservations ($\\sim$0.3\"). Although similar in the compactness of their radio\nstructures, these sources have steep radio spectra and host galaxy properties\nthat distinguish them from local low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) that are\nunresolved on similar scales. The remaining sources exhibit extended radio\nstructures with projected diameters $\\sim$1.4$-$19.0 kpc and a variety of\nmorphologies: three double-lobed; two large-scale diffuse; one jetted and\n`S-shaped'; one undetermined. Only 19 per cent of the sample therefore exhibit\nthe double-lobed/edge-brightened structures often associated with their\ncounterparts at high and low radio powers: radio-powerful HERGs and Seyfert\ngalaxies, respectively. Additional high-resolution observations are required to\ninvestigate this further, and to probe the $\\lesssim$300 pc scales on which\nsome Seyfert galaxies show extended structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

In continuum versions\nof this model an oscillator population is represented by a probability density\non the circle. Ott and Antonsen identified a special class of densities which\nis invariant under the dynamics and on which the dynamics are low-dimensional\nand analytically tractable. The reduction to the OA manifold has been used to\nanalyze the dynamics of many variants of the Kuramoto model. To address the\nfundamental question of whether the OA manifold is attracting, we develop a\nsystematic technique using weighted averages of Poisson measures for analyzing\ndynamics off the OA manifold. We show that for models with a finite number of\npopulations, the OA manifold is {\\it not} attracting in any sense; moreover,\nthe dynamics off the OA manifold is often more complex than on the OA manifold,\neven at the level of macroscopic order parameters. The OA manifold consists of\nPoisson densities $\\rho_\\omega$. A simple extension of the OA manifold consists\nof averages of pairs of Poisson densities; then the hyperbolic distance between\nthe centroids of each Poisson pair is a dynamical invariant (for each\n$\\omega$). These conserved quantities, defined on the double Poisson manifold,\nare a measure of the distance to the OA manifold. This invariance implies that\nchimera states, which have some but not all populations in sync, can never be\nstable in the full state space, even if stable in the OA manifold. More\nbroadly, our framework facilitates the analysis of multi-population continuum\nKuramoto networks beyond the restrictions of the OA manifold, and has the\npotential to reveal more intricate dynamical behavior than has previously been\nobserved for these networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 19:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

Initially, the NP sublimation rates\nwere ca. 400 times faster than that for bulk graphite, and there were large\nNP-to-NP variations. Over time, the rate slowed substantially, though remaining\nwell above the bulk rate. The initial activation energies (Eas) were\ncorrespondingly low and doubled as a few monolayer's worth of material were\nsublimed from the surfaces. The high initial rates and low Eas are attributed\nto large numbers of edge and other low coordination sites on the NP surfaces,\nand the changes are attributed to atomic-scale \"smoothing\" of the surface by\npreferential sublimation of the less stable sites. The emissivity of the NPs\nalso changed after heating, most frequently increasing. The emissivity and\nsublimation rates were anti-correlated, leading to the conclusion that high\ndensities of low-coordination sites on the NP surfaces enhances sublimation but\nsuppresses emissivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 19:15:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 03:59:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

Understanding the thought processes and behaviors of\nadversaries is extremely challenging as high profile or even amateur attackers\nhave no incentive to share the trades associated with their illegal activities.\nOne opportunity to observe the actions the adversaries perform is through the\nuse of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) which generate alerts in the event\nthat suspicious behavior was detected. The alerts raised by these systems\ntypically describe the suspicious actions via the form of attack 'signature',\nwhich do not necessarily reveal the true intent of the attacker performing the\naction. Meanwhile, several high level frameworks exist to describe the sequence\nor chain of action types an adversary might perform. These frameworks, however,\ndo not connect the action types to observables of standard intrusion detection\nsystems, nor describing the plausible intents of the adversarial actions. To\naddress these gaps, this work proposes the Action-Intent Framework (AIF) to\ncomplement existing Cyber Attack Kill Chains and Attack Taxonomies. The AIF\ndefines a set of Action-Intent States (AIS) at two levels of description: the\nMacro-AIS describes 'what' the attacker is trying to achieve and the Micro-AIS\ndescribes \"how\" the intended goal is achieved.

In a standard SPARC, codewords are sparse\nlinear combinations of columns of an i.i.d. Gaussian design matrix, while in a\nspatially coupled SPARC the design matrix has a block-wise structure, where the\nvariance of the Gaussian entries can be varied across blocks. A well-designed\nspatial coupling structure can significantly enhance the error performance of\niterative decoding algorithms such as Approximate Message Passing (AMP).\n  In this paper, we obtain a non-asymptotic bound on the probability of error\nof spatially coupled SPARCs with AMP decoding. Applying this bound to a simple\nband-diagonal design matrix, we prove that spatially coupled SPARCs with AMP\ndecoding achieve the capacity of the AWGN channel. The bound also highlights\nhow the decay of error probability depends on each design parameter of the\nspatially coupled SPARC. An attractive feature of AMP decoding is that its\nasymptotic mean squared error (MSE) can be predicted via a deterministic\nrecursion called state evolution. Our result provides the first proof that the\nMSE concentrates on the state evolution prediction for spatially coupled\ndesigns. Combined with the state evolution prediction, this result implies that\nspatially coupled SPARCs with the proposed band-diagonal design are\ncapacity-achieving. Using the proof technique used to establish the main\nresult, we also obtain a concentration inequality for the MSE of AMP applied to\ncompressed sensing with spatially coupled design matrices.

Traditionally, evasion has been linked to the decreasing risk\naversion in higher revenues (Allingham and Sandmo (1972), Cowell (1985)\n(1990)). I claim tax evasion to be a rational choice when compliance is\nstochastically more expensive than evading, even in absence of controls and\nsanctions. I create a framework able to measure the incentives for taxpayers to\ncomply. The incentives here are deductions of specific VAT documented expenses\nfrom the income tax. The issue is very well known and deduction policies at\nwork in many countries. The aim is to compute the right parameters for each\nprecise class of taxpayers. VAT evasion is a collusive conduct between the two\ncounterparts of the transaction. I therefore first explore the convenience for\nthe two private counterparts to agree on the joint evasion and to form a\ncoalition. Crucial is that compliance incentives break the agreement among the\ntransaction participants' coalition about evading. The game solution leads to\nboundaries for marginal tax rates or deduction percentages, depending on\nparameters, able to create incentives to comply The stylized example presented\nhere for VAT policies, already in use in many countries, is an attempt to\nestablish a more general method for tax design, able to make compliance the\n\"dominant strategy\", satisfying the \"outside option\" constraint represented by\nevasion, even in absence of audit and sanctions.

The\ngripping force, mainly originated from the van der Waals force between the\nadhesive composite and the object to be gripped, can be controlled by\nreversibly varying the physical properties (e.g., stiffness) of the composite\nvia external stimuli. The maximal gripping force Fmax and its tunability depend\non, among other factors, the stress distribution on the gripping interface and\nits fracture dynamics (during detaching), which in turn are determined by the\ncomposite microstructure. Here, we present a computational framework for the\nmodeling and design of a class of binary smart composites containing a porous\nlow-melting-point alloy (LMPA) phase and a polymer phase, in order to achieve\ndesirable dynamically tunable dry adhesion.

The reduction loses\nonly a constant factor in the approximation guarantee, marking the first true\nconstant factor approximation for many of these problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 21:54:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 23:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

Therefore the\nclassification is based on the specific relationship between the reference\nobject to be recreated, the observer measuring the object, the orientation and\nplacement of the reference and illumination field, and the desired placement of\nthe metasurface hologram creating a virtual image. In the paper a general\ndesign procedure to synthesize metasurface holograms is presented based on\nIntegral Equations (IE) and Generalized Sheet Transition Conditions (GSTCs),\nwhere the metasurface hologram is described as zero thickness sheet with\ntensorial surface susceptibility densities. Several selected configurations are\nchosen to illustrate various aspects of the hologram creation in 2D, along with\na novel numerical technique to artificially reverse propagate the scattered\nfields, required in the synthesis process. Finally, the impact of the\nmetasurface size and the illumination field strength on the quality of the\nreconstructed scattered fields is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 22:34:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

Goal-directed RL has seen large\ngains in sample efficiency, due to the ease of reusing or generating new\nexperience by proposing goals. One approach,self-play, allows an agent to\n\"play\" against itself by alternatively setting and accomplishing goals,\ncreating a learned curriculum through which an agent can learn to accomplish\nprogressively more difficult goals. However, self-play has been limited to goal\ncurriculum learning or learning progressively harder goals within a single\nenvironment. Recent work on robotic agents has shown that varying the\nenvironment during training, for example with domain randomization, leads to\nmore robust transfer. As a result, we extend the self-play framework to jointly\nlearn a goal and environment curriculum, leading to an approach that learns the\nmost fruitful domain randomization strategy with self-play. Our method,\nSelf-Supervised Active Domain Randomization(SS-ADR), generates a coupled\ngoal-task curriculum, where agents learn through progressively more difficult\ntasks and environment variations. By encouraging the agent to try tasks that\nare just outside of its current capabilities, SS-ADR builds a domain\nrandomization curriculum that enables state-of-the-art results on\nvarioussim2real transfer tasks.

Despite significant progress made by decades\nof research on mitigation techniques, existing countermeasures fall short due\nto either limited coverage or overly high overhead. Furthermore, they require\nexternal mechanisms (e.g., spatial memory safety) to protect their metadata.\nOtherwise, their protection can be bypassed or disabled. To address these\nlimitations, we present robust points-to authentication, a novel runtime scheme\nfor detecting all kinds of temporal memory corruptions. We built a prototype\nsystem, called PTAuth, that realizes this scheme on ARM architectures. PTAuth\ncontains a customized compiler for code analysis and instrumentation and a\nruntime library for performing the points-to authentication as a protected\nprogram runs. PTAuth leverages the Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) feature,\nprovided by the ARMv8.3 and later CPUs, which serves as a simple hardware-based\nencryption primitive. PTAuth uses minimal in-memory metadata and protects its\nmetadata without requiring spatial memory safety. We report our evaluation of\nPTAuth in terms of security, robustness and performance using 150 vulnerable\nprograms from Juliet test suite and the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks. PTAuth detects\nall three categories of heap-based temporal memory corruptions, generates zero\nfalse alerts, and slows down program execution by 26% (this number was measured\nbased on software-emulated PAC; it is expected to decrease to 20% when using\nhardware-based PAC).

The complex interaction among these\nproperties' impact on the execution cost poses a challenge to optimizing\ncompilers. Existing compilers resort to intricate heuristics that complicate\nthe codebase and add maintenance cost but fail to search through the large\nspace of equivalent LA expressions to find the cheapest one. We introduce a\ngeneral optimization technique for LA expressions, by converting the LA\nexpressions into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions, optimizing the latter,\nthen converting the result back to (optimized) LA expressions. One major\nadvantage of this method is that it is complete, meaning that any equivalent LA\nexpression can be found using the equivalence rules in RA. The challenge is the\nmajor size of the search space, and we address this by adopting and extending a\ntechnique used in compilers, called equality saturation.

The evolving\nnature of temporal dynamic graphs requires handling new nodes as well as\ncapturing temporal patterns. The node embeddings, which are now functions of\ntime, should represent both the static node features and the evolving\ntopological structures. Moreover, node and topological features can be temporal\nas well, whose patterns the node embeddings should also capture. We propose the\ntemporal graph attention (TGAT) layer to efficiently aggregate\ntemporal-topological neighborhood features as well as to learn the time-feature\ninteractions. For TGAT, we use the self-attention mechanism as building block\nand develop a novel functional time encoding technique based on the classical\nBochner's theorem from harmonic analysis. By stacking TGAT layers, the network\nrecognizes the node embeddings as functions of time and is able to inductively\ninfer embeddings for both new and observed nodes as the graph evolves. The\nproposed approach handles both node classification and link prediction task,\nand can be naturally extended to include the temporal edge features. We\nevaluate our method with transductive and inductive tasks under temporal\nsettings with two benchmark and one industrial dataset. Our TGAT model compares\nfavorably to state-of-the-art baselines as well as the previous temporal graph\nembedding approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 02:05:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

By employing an infinite-dimensional\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) as the hypothesis space, the nonlinear\nestimation problem in finite-dimensional Euclidean space is recast into that of\nconstructing a linear observer in the infinite-dimensional RKHS. The analysis\nof convergence is facilitated by the introduction of a novel condition of\npartial persistent excitation (partial PE), which is defined for a subspace of\nthe RKHS. Using this condition, we prove that the projection of the function\nestimation error onto the PE subspace converges in norm asymptotically to zero.\nWhile this is an abstract notion of convergence that depends implicitly on the\nkernel used to define the RKHS, we derive conditions that ensure the pointwise\nconvergence of the function estimates over the PE subset. This paper\nadditionally introduces a weaker but geometrically intuitive notion of a\npartial PE condition, one that resembles PE conditions as they have been\nformulated historically in Euclidean spaces. Sufficient conditions are derived\nthat describe when the two conditions are equivalent.

In this work, we present detailed observations of a\nsympathetic filament eruption event, where an identifiable causal link between\ntwo eruptive filaments is observed. On 2015 November 15, two filaments (F1 in\nthe north and F2 in the south) were located at the southwestern quadrant of\nsolar disk. The main axes of them were almost parallel to each other. Around\n22:20 UT, F1 began to erupt, forming two flare ribbons. The southwestern ribbon\napparently moved to southwest and intruded southeast part of F2. This\ncontinuous intrusion caused F2's eventual eruption. Accompanying the eruption\nof F2, flare ribbons and post-flare loops appeared in northwest region of F2.\nMeanwhile, neither flare ribbons nor post-flare loops could be observed in\nsoutheastern area of F2.

Considering that the surface plasmon resonance frequency of\nmetallic nanoparticles, such as gold, silver, and aluminum, is usually located\nin the ultraviolet to visible range, the absorption coefficient of a plasmonic\nnanofluid must be spectrally tuned for full utilization of the solar radiation\nin a broad spectrum. In the present study, a modern design process in the form\nof a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to the tailoring of the spectral\nabsorption coefficient of a plasmonic nanofluid. To do this, the major\ncomponents of a conventional GA, such as the gene description, fitness function\nfor the evaluation, crossover, and mutation function, are modified to be\nsuitable for the inverse problem of tailoring the spectral absorption\ncoefficient of a plasmonic nanofluid. By applying the customized GA, we\nobtained an optimal combination for a blended nanofluid with the desired\nspectral distribution of the absorption coefficient, specifically a uniform\ndistribution, solar-spectrum-like distribution, and a step-function-like\ndistribution. The resulting absorption coefficient of the designed plasmonic\nnanofluid is in good agreement with the prescribed spectral distribution within\nabout 10\\% to 20\\% of error when six types of nanoparticles are blended.\nFinally, we also investigate how the inhomogeneous broadening effect caused by\nthe fabrication uncertainty of the nanoparticles changes their optimal\ncombination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 05:05:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-06"}

However, they fall short in two\naspects: (1) they do not allow models to explicitly learn signals across\ndomains and slots to detect potential dependencies among (domain, slot) pairs;\nand (2) existing models follow auto-regressive approaches which incur high time\ncost when the dialogue evolves over multiple domains and multiple turns. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework of Non-Autoregressive Dialog State\nTracking (NADST) which can factor in potential dependencies among domains and\nslots to optimize the models towards better prediction of dialogue states as a\ncomplete set rather than separate slots. In particular, the non-autoregressive\nnature of our method not only enables decoding in parallel to significantly\nreduce the latency of DST for real-time dialogue response generation, but also\ndetect dependencies among slots at token level in addition to slot and domain\nlevel. Our empirical results show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art\njoint accuracy across all domains on the MultiWOZ 2.1 corpus, and the latency\nof our model is an order of magnitude lower than the previous state of the art\nas the dialogue history extends over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 06:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

This paper introduces a physiological dataset PAFEW, which is\nobtained using movie clips from the Acted Facial Expressions in the Wild (AFEW)\ndataset as stimuli. To establish a baseline, we use the electrodermal activity\n(EDA) signals in this dataset and extract 6 features from each signal series\ncorresponding to each movie clip to recognize 7 emotions, i.e., Anger, Disgust,\nFear, Happy, Surprise, Sad and Neutral. Overall, 24 observers participated in\nour collection of the training set, including 19 observers who participated in\nonly one session watching 80 videos from 7 classes and 5 observers who\nparticipated multiple times and watched all the videos. All videos were\npresented in an order balanced fashion. Leave-one-observer-out was employed in\nthis classification task.

We also investigate the recognition accuracy of grouping the\ndataset by arousal or valence, which achieves 68.66% and 72.72% separately.\nFinally, we provide a two-step network. The first step is to classify the\nfeatures into high/low arousal or positive/negative valence by a network. Then\nthe arousal/valence middle output of the first step is concatenated with\nfeature sets as input of the second step for emotion recognition.

Such a merger-formed BH is expected to\ntypically have a high spin (a=0.7). If such a massive BH acquires another BH it\nmay lead to another merger detectable by LIGO/Virgo in gravitational waves.\nAcquiring a companion may be hindered by gravitational-wave kick/recoil, which\naccompanies the first merger and may quickly remove the massive BH from its\nparent globular or nuclear cluster. We test whether it is possible for a\nmassive merger-formed BH in the pair-instability gap to be retained in its\nparent cluster and have low spin. Such a BH would be indistinguishable from a\nprimordial BH. We employed results from numerical relativity calculations of\nblack hole mergers to explore the range of gravitational-wave recoil velocities\nfor various combinations of merging BH masses and spins. We compared\nmerger-formed massive BH speeds with typical escape velocities from globular\nand nuclear clusters. We show that a globular cluster is highly unlikely to\nform and retain a 100 Msun BH if the spin of the BH is low (a<0.3) as such BHs\nacquire high recoil speeds (>200 km/s) that exceed typical escape speeds from\nglobular clusters (50 km/s). However, a very low-spinning (a=0.1) and massive\n(100 Msun) BH could be formed and retained in a galactic nuclear star cluster.\nEven though such massive merger-formed BHs with such low spins acquire high\nspeeds during formation (400 km/s), they may avoid ejection since massive\nnuclear clusters have high escape velocities (300-500 km/s). A future detection\nof a massive BH in the pair-instability mass gap with low spin would therefore\nnot be proof of the existence of primordial BHs, which are sometimes claimed to\nhave low spins and arbitrarily high masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 08:25:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 07:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

The effect is\ndependent on the dimension and the explicit form of the local coin. A four\nstate discrete-time quantum walk on a square lattice is defined by its unitary\ncoin operator, acting on the four dimensional coin Hilbert space. The well\nknown example of the Grover coin leads to a partial trapping, i.e., there\nexists some escaping initial state for which the probability of staying at the\ninitial position vanishes. On the other hand, some other coins are known to\nexhibit strong trapping, where such escaping state does not exist. We present a\nsystematic study of coins leading to trapping, explicitly construct all such\ncoins for discrete-time quantum walks on the 2D square lattice, and classify\nthem according to the structure of the operator and the manifestation of the\ntrapping effect.

We simulate light curves of Earth-sized exoplanets\ntransiting continuum intensity images of the Sun taken by the HMI instrument\naboard SDO to investigate the uncertainties introduced on the exoplanet radius\nmeasurements by stellar granulation and oscillations. After modeling the solar\nvariability with a Gaussian process, we find that the amplitude of solar\noscillations and granulation is of order 100 ppm -- similar to the depth of an\nEarth transit -- and introduces a fractional uncertainty on the depth of\ntransit of 0.73% assuming four transits are observed over the mission duration.\nHowever, when we translate the depth measurement into a radius measurement of\nthe planet, we find a much larger radius uncertainty of 3.6%. This is due to a\ndegeneracy between the transit radius ratio, the limb-darkening, and the impact\nparameter caused by the inability to constrain the transit impact parameter in\nthe presence of stellar variability. We find that surface brightness\ninhomogeneity due to photospheric granulation contributes a lower limit of only\n2 ppm to the photometry in-transit. The radius uncertainty due to granulation\nand oscillations, combined with the degeneracy with the transit impact\nparameter, accounts for a significant fraction of the error budget of the PLATO\nmission, before detector or observational noise is introduced to the light\ncurve.

Usually, the\nforce (torque) acting on a planet is calculated using the forces from the gas\ndisc and the star, while the gas accelerations are computed using the pressure\ngradient, the star, and the planet's gravity, ignoring its own gravity. For the\nnon-migrating the neglect of the disc gravity results in a consistent torque\ncalculation while for the migrating case it is inconsistent. We aim to study\nhow much this inconsistent torque calculation can affect the final\nconfiguration of a two-planet system. Our focus will be on low-mass planets\nbecause most of the multi-planetary systems, discovered by the Kepler survey,\nhave masses around 10 Earth masses. Performing hydrodynamical simulations of\nplanet-disc interaction, we measure the torques on non-migrating and migrating\nplanets for various disc masses as well as density and temperature slopes with\nand without considering the disc self-gravity. Using this data, we find a\nrelation that quantifies the inconsistency, use it in an N-body code, and\nperform an extended parameter study modelling the migration of a planetary\nsystem with different planet mass ratios and disc surface densities, in order\nto investigate the impact of the torque inconsistency on the architecture of\nthe planetary system. Not considering disc self-gravity produces an\nartificially larger torque on the migrating planet that can result in tighter\nplanetary systems. The deviation of this torque from the correct value is\nlarger in discs with steeper surface density profiles. In hydrodynamical\nmodelling of multi-planetary systems, it is crucial to account for the torque\ncorrection, otherwise the results favour more packed systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 09:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

Consequently, to our knowledge none of them is ideal for scenarios in\nwhich (i) query processing must be done in realtime, and (ii) the underlying\ngraph G is massive, with frequent updates.\n  Motivated by this, we propose SimPush, a novel algorithm that answers single\nsource SimRank queries without any pre-computation, and at the same time\nachieves significantly higher query processing speed than even the fastest\nknown index-based solutions. Further, SimPush provides rigorous result quality\nguarantees, and its high performance does not rely on any strong assumption of\nthe underlying graph.

Research shows that malleability improves system performance, but\nits utilization in HPC never became widespread. The causes are the difficulty\nin developing malleable applications, and the lack of support and integration\nof the different layers of the HPC software stack. However, in the last years,\nmalleability in job scheduling is becoming more critical because of the\nincreasing complexity of hardware and workloads. In this context, using nodes\nin an exclusive mode is not always the most efficient solution as in\ntraditional HPC jobs, where applications were highly tuned for static\nallocations, but offering zero flexibility to dynamic executions. This paper\nproposes a new holistic, dynamic job scheduling policy, Slowdown Driven\n(SD-Policy), which exploits the malleability of applications as the key\ntechnology to reduce the average slowdown and response time of jobs. SD-Policy\nis based on backfill and node sharing. It applies malleability to running jobs\nto make room for jobs that will run with a reduced set of resources, only when\nthe estimated slowdown improves over the static approach. We implemented\nSD-Policy in SLURM and evaluated it in a real production environment, and with\na simulator using workloads of up to 198K jobs.

Therefore, there is a need to optimally\nallocate and size them to avoid cases such as voltage instability and expensive\ninvestment costs. In this paper, two swarm-based meta-heuristic algorithms,\nparticle swarm optimization (PSO) and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) were\ndeveloped to solve optimal placement and sizing of DG units in the quest for\ntransmission network planning. A supportive technique, loss sensitivity factors\n(LSF) was used to identify potential buses for optimal location of DG units.\nThe feasibility of the algorithms was confirmed on two IEEE bus test systems\n(14- and 30-bus).

These interfacial phenomena play crucial roles for\nmagnetic data storage and transfer applications, which require forming FM\nnano-structures embedded in non-ferromagnetic matrices. Here, we investigate\nthe possiblity of creating such nano-structures by ion-irradiation. We study\nthe effect of lateral confinement on the ion-irradiation-induced reduction of\nnon-magnetic metal oxides (e.g., antiferro- or paramagnetic) to form\nferromagnetic metals. Our findings are later exploited to form 3-dimensional\nmagnetic interfaces between Co, CoO and Pt by spatially-selective irradiation\nof CoO/Pt multilayers. We demonstrate that the mechanical displacement of the O\natoms plays a crucial role during the reduction from insulating,\nnon-ferromagnetic cobalt oxides to metallic cobalt. Metallic cobalt yields both\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy in the generated Co/Pt nano-structures, and,\nat low temperatures, exchange bias at vertical interfaces between Co and CoO.\nIf pushed to the limit of ion-irradiation technology, this approach could, in\nprinciple, enable the creation of densely-packed, atomic scale ferromagnetic\npoint-contact spin-torque oscillator (STO) networks, or conductive channels for\ncurrent-confined-path based current perpendicular-to-plane giant\nmagnetoresistance read-heads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 09:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

Originally proposed for powering the\nStellar payment network, FBASs can instantiate Byzantine quorum systems without\nrequiring out-of-band agreement on a common set of validators; every node is\nfree to decide for itself with whom it requires agreement. Sybil-resistant and\nyet energy-efficient consensus protocols can therefore be built upon FBASs, and\nthe \"decentrality\" possible with the FBAS paradigm might be sufficient to\nreduce the use of environmentally unsustainable proof-of-work protocols. In\nthis paper, we first demonstrate how the robustness of individual FBASs can be\ndetermined, by precisely determining their safety and liveness buffers and\ntherefore enabling a comparison with threshold-based quorum systems.

As a consequence, federations composed of different data models like RDF\nand relational databases evolved. One type of these federations are Semantic\nData Lakes where every data source is kept in its original data model and\nsemantically annotated with ontologies or controlled vocabularies. However,\nstate-of-the-art query engines for federated query processing over Semantic\nData Lakes often rely on optimization techniques tailored for RDF. In this\npaper, we present query optimization techniques guided by heuristics that take\nthe physical design of a Data Lake into account. The heuristics are implemented\non top of Ontario, a SPARQL query engine for Semantic Data Lakes. Using\nsource-specific heuristics, the query engine is able to generate more efficient\nquery execution plans by exploiting the knowledge about indexes and\nnormalization in relational databases. We show that heuristics which take the\nphysical design of the Data Lake into account are able to speed up query\nprocessing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 10:59:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 19:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

The objective is to jointly\ndetermine the offloading decision of each task and the resource allocation\nunder time-varying wireless fading channels and stochastic edge computing\ncapability, so that the energy-time cost (ETC) of the MD is minimized. Solving\nthe problem is particularly hard due to the combinatorial offloading decisions\nand the strong coupling among task executions under the general dependency\nmodel. Conventional numerical optimization methods are inefficient to solve\nsuch a problem, especially when the problem size is large. To address the\nissue, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on the\nactor-critic learning structure. In particular, the actor network utilizes a\nDNN to learn the optimal mapping from the input states to the binary offloading\ndecision of each task. Meanwhile, by analyzing the structure of the optimal\nsolution, we derive a low-complexity algorithm for the critic network to\nquickly evaluate the ETC performance of the offloading decisions output by the\nactor network. With the low-complexity critic network, we can quickly select\nthe best offloading action and subsequently store the state-action pair in an\nexperience replay memory as the training dataset to continuously improve the\naction generation DNN. To further reduce the complexity, we show that the\noptimal offloading decision exhibits an one-climb structure, which can be\nutilized to significantly reduce the search space of action generation.\nNumerical results show that for various types of task graphs, the proposed\nalgorithm achieves up to $99.1\\%$ of the optimal performance while\nsignificantly reducing the computational complexity compared to the existing\noptimization methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 11:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

In the last years the number of bio-inspired\noptimization approaches in literature has grown considerably, reaching\nunprecedented levels that dark the future prospects of this field of research.\nThis paper addresses this problem by proposing two comprehensive,\nprinciple-based taxonomies that allow researchers to organize existing and\nfuture algorithmic developments into well-defined categories, considering two\ndifferent criteria: the source of inspiration and the behavior of each\nalgorithm.

Massive MIMO\ntechniques, though widely used in terrestrial communication systems, have not\nbeen applied to LEO satellite communication systems. In this paper, we propose\na massive MIMO transmission scheme with full frequency reuse (FFR) for LEO\nsatellite communication systems and exploit statistical channel state\ninformation (sCSI) to address the difficulty of obtaining instantaneous CSI\n(iCSI) at the transmitter. We first establish the massive MIMO channel model\nfor LEO satellite communications and simplify the transmission designs via\nperforming Doppler and delay compensations at user terminals (UTs). Then, we\ndevelop the low-complexity sCSI based downlink (DL) precoder and uplink (UL)\nreceiver in closed-form, aiming to maximize the average\nsignal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (ASLNR) and the average\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (ASINR), respectively. It is shown that\nthe DL ASLNRs and UL ASINRs of all UTs reach their upper bounds under some\nchannel condition. Motivated by this, we propose a space angle based user\ngrouping (SAUG) algorithm to schedule the served UTs into different groups,\nwhere each group of UTs use the same time and frequency resource. The proposed\nalgorithm is asymptotically optimal in the sense that the lower and upper\nbounds of the achievable rate coincide when the number of satellite antennas or\nUT groups is sufficiently large. Numerical results demonstrate that the\nproposed massive MIMO transmission scheme with FFR significantly enhances the\ndata rate of LEO satellite communication systems. Notably, the proposed sCSI\nbased precoder and receiver achieve the similar performance with the iCSI based\nones that are often infeasible in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 13:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-24"}

Helium-3 has been one of the\nmain actors in thermal and cold neutron detection for many years. Nowadays\nneutron facilities around the world are pushing their technologies to increase\nthe available flux delivered at the instruments, this enables a completely new\nscience landscape. Complementary with the increasing available flux, a better\nsignal-to-background ratio (S/B) enables to perform new types of measurements.\nTo this aim, this manuscript re-examines the background sensitivity of today's\n\"gold standard\" neutron detection. Fast neutrons and gamma-rays are the main\nbackground species in neutron scattering experiments. The efficiency\n(sensitivity) of detecting fast neutrons, cosmic rays and gamma-rays, for a\nHelium-3-based detector is studied here through the comparison with Helium-4\ncounters.

Thin film growth of the\nmaterial may enable not only tuning the basic physical properties beyond what\nbulk materials can exhibit, but also developing novel hybrid materials by\ninterfacing with dissimilar materials, yet this has proven to be extremely\nchallenging. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of metallic delafossite\nPdCrO2 films by pulsed laser epitaxy (PLE). The fundamental role of the PLE\ngrowth conditions, epitaxial strain, and chemical and structural\ncharacteristics of the substrate is investigated by growing under various\ngrowth conditions and on various types of substrates. While strain plays a\nlarge role in improving the crystallinities, the direct growth of epitaxial\nPdCrO2 films without impurity phases was not successful. We attribute this\ndifficulty to both the chemical and structural dissimilarities between the\nsubstrates and volatile nature of PdO layer, which make nucleation of the right\nphase difficult. This difficulty was overcome by growing CuCrO2 buffer layers\nbefore PdCrO2 were grown. Unlike PdCrO2, CuCrO2 films were rather readily grown\nwith a relatively wide growth window. Only monolayer thick buffer layer was\nsufficient to grow the correct PdCrO2 phase.

They\ncome in two flavours depending on the presence or not of technetium (Tc), an\nelement without stable isotopes. Intrinsic S stars are Tc-rich and genuine\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB)stars while extrinsic S stars owe their s-process\noverabundances to the pollution from a former AGB companion, now a white\ndwarf(WD). In addition to Tc, another distinctive feature between intrinsic and\nextrinsic S stars is the overabundance of niobium (Nb) in the latter class. We\ndiscuss the case of the S stars BD+79 156 and o1Ori whose specificity is to\nshare the distinctive features of both intrinsic and extrinsic S stars, namely\nthe presence of Tc along with a Nb overabundance. BD+79 156 is the first clear\ncase of a bitrinsic star, i.e. a doubly s-process-enriched object, first\nthrough mass transfer in a binary system, and then through internal\nnucleosynthesis (responsible for the Tc-enrichment in BD+79 156 which must\ntherefore have reached the AGB phase of its evolution). This hybrid nature of\nthe s-process pattern in BD+79 156 is supported by its binary nature and its\nlocation in the HR diagram just beyond the onset of the third dredge-up on the\nAGB. The Tc-rich, binary S-star o1Ori with a WD companion was another\nlong-standing candidate for a similar hybrid s-process enrichment. However the\nmarginal overabundance of Nb derived ino1Ori does not allow to trace\nunambiguously the evidence of a large pollution coming from the AGB progenitor\nof its current WD companion. As a side product, the current study offers a new\nway of detecting binary AGB stars with WD companions by identifying their\nTc-rich nature along with a Nb overabundance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 13:50:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

The question comes down to estimating the appearance rate of\nsuch things in the cosmos --- a radically uncertain quantity. Despite this\nprior uncertainty, anthropic considerations give rise to Bayesian updates, and\nthus predictions. The Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA), a school of anthropic\nprobability, has previously been used for this purpose. Here, we derive\npredictions from the alternative school, the Self-Indication Assumption (SIA),\nand point out its features. SIA favors a higher appearance rate of\nexpansionistic life, but our existence at the present cosmic time means that\nsuch life cannot be too common (else our galaxy would long ago have been\noverrun). This combination squeezes our vast prior uncertainty into a few\norders of magnitude. Details of the background cosmology fall out, and we are\nleft with some stark conclusions. E.g. if the limits to technology allow a\ncivilization to expand at speed $v$, the probability of at least one expanding\ncosmological civilization being visible on our past light cone is\n$1-\\frac{v^3}{c^3}$. We also show how the SIA estimate can be updated from the\nresults of a hypothetical full-sky survey that detects \"$n$\" expanding\ncivilizations (for $n \\geq 0$), and calculate the implied final extent of life\nin the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 16:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

For $k<n$, let $\\mathbf{A} \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^{k \\times n}$ be the innermost weight matrix of an arbitrary feed\nforward neural network $M:\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$, so $M(x)$ can be\nwritten as $M(x) = \\sigma(\\mathbf{A} x)$, for some network $\\sigma:\\mathbb{R}^k\n\\to \\mathbb{R}$.

We use the EURO STOXX 50 option implied volatilities and\nthe VSTOXX index value to estimate the parameters of this Heston model.\nFollowing the calibration, we calculate theoretical VSTOXX future prices and\ncompare them to the actual market prices. While theoretical and market prices\nare usually in line, we also observe time periods, during which the market\nprice does not agree with our Heston model. We collect a variety of market\nfeatures that could potentially explain the price deviations and calibrate two\nmachine learning models to the price difference: a regularized linear model and\na random forest. We find that both models indicate a strong influence of\naccumulated trader positions on the VSTOXX futures price.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 14:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

In this\npaper, we investigate effects of fast inward migration of the planet on the gap\nshape, by carrying out hydrodynamic simulations. We found that when the\nmigration timescale is shorter than the timescale of the gap-opening, the\norbital radius is shifted inward as compared to the radial location of the gap.\nWe also found a scaling relation between the radial shift of the locations of\nthe planet and the gap as a function of the ratio of the timescale of the\nmigration and gap-opening.

We discover that a\nnumber of fundamental intractable optimization problems being parameterized by\nk admit subexponential algorithms on graphs from Chordal-ke. We identify a\nlarge class of optimization problems on Chordal-ke that admit algorithms with\nthe typical running time 2^{O(\\sqrt{k}\\log k)}\\cdot n^{O(1)}. Examples of the\nproblems from this class are finding an independent set of maximum weight,\nfinding a feedback vertex set or an odd cycle transversal of minimum weight, or\nthe problem of finding a maximum induced planar subgraph.

Besides subexponential time algorithms, the class of Chordal-ke graphs\nappears to be appealing from the perspective of kernelization (with parameter\nk).

In particular, we construct a polynomial\nTuring kernel for Weighted Clique on Chordal-ke graphs. For (unweighted)\nIndependent Set we design polynomial kernels on two interesting subclasses of\nChordal-ke, namely, Interval-ke and Split-ke graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 15:08:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 14:16:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

Stars rotate differentially and this\naffects the shape and amplitude of this signal, on a level that can no longer\nbe ignored with precise spectrographs. Highly misaligned planets provide a\nunique opportunity to probe stellar differential rotation via the RM effect, as\nthey cross several stellar latitudes. In this sense, WASP-7, and its hot\nJupiter with a projected misalignment of \\sim 90{\\deg}, is one of the most\npromising targets. The aim of this work is to understand if the stellar\ndifferential rotation is measurable through the RM signal for systems with a\ngeometry similar to WASP-7. In this sense, we use a modified version of SOAP3.0\nto explore the main hurdles that prevented the precise determination of the\ndifferential rotation of WASP-7. We also investigate whether the adoption of\nthe next generation spectrographs, like ESPRESSO, would solve these issues.\nAdditionally, we assess how instrumental and stellar noise influence this\neffect and the derived geometry of the system. We found that, for WASP-7, the\nwhite noise represents an important hurdle in the detection of the stellar\ndifferential rotation, and that a precision of at least 2m/s or better is\nessential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 15:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

In particular, we show that almost\nevery real number with respect to Lebesgue measure can be written as the sum of\ntwo numbers with sufficiently large prescribed irrationality exponents. A\nsimilar result holds when restricting to classical missing digit Cantor sets.\nThis implies that the subset of numbers with prescribed large irrationality\nexponent has full packing dimension, i.e. the same packing dimension as the\nentire Cantor set.

From a practical\nperspective, since simpler operations are required, learning algorithms in the\nQSQ model are more feasible for implementation on near-term quantum devices. We\nprove a number of results about the QSQ learning model. We first show that\nparity functions, (log n)-juntas and polynomial-sized DNF formulas are\nefficiently learnable in the QSQ model, in contrast to the classical setting\nwhere these problems are provably hard. This implies that many of the\nadvantages of quantum PAC learning can be realized even in the more restricted\nquantum SQ learning model. It is well-known that weak statistical query\ndimension, denoted by WSQDIM(C), characterizes the complexity of learning a\nconcept class C in the classical SQ model.

Among all possible SOTs, we choose to work with the\nDivergence Type Theories (DTT) formalism, which ensures that the second law of\nthermodynamics is fulfilled non-perturbatively. The tensor modes include two\ndivergence-free modes which have no analog in theories based on covariant\ngeneralizations of the Navier-Stokes equation, and that are particularly\nrelevant because they couple linearly to a gravitational field. To study the\ndynamics of this irreducible tensor sector, we observe that in causal theories\nsuch as DTTs, thermal fluctuations induce a stochastic stirring force, which\nexcites the tensor modes while preserving energy momentum conservation. From\nfluctuation-dissipation considerations it follows that the random force is\nGaussian with a white spectrum. The irreducible tensor modes in turn excite\nvector modes, which back-react on the tensor sector, thus producing a\nconsistent non-linear, second order description of the divergence-free tensor\ndynamics. Using the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) formalism plus the Two-Particle\nIrreducible Effective Action (2PIEA) formalism, we obtain the one-loop\ncorrected equations for the relevant two-point correlation functions of the\nmodel: the retarded propagator and the Hadamard function. The overall result of\nthe self-consistent dynamics of the irreducible tensor modes at this order is a\ndepletion of the spectrum in the UV sector, which suggests that tensor modes\ncould sustain an inverse entropy cascade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 17:04:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 14:14:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 13:24:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 00:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

The majority of existing work\nfocuses on accelerating image classification, while other fundamental vision\nproblems, including object detection and instance segmentation, have not been\nadequately addressed. Compared with image classification, detection problems\nare more sensitive to the spatial variance of objects, and therefore, require\nspecialized convolutions to aggregate spatial information. To address this,\nrecent work proposes dynamic deformable convolution to augment regular\nconvolutions. Regular convolutions process a fixed grid of pixels across all\nthe spatial locations in an image, while dynamic deformable convolutions may\naccess arbitrary pixels in the image and the access pattern is input-dependent\nand varies per spatial location. These properties lead to inefficient memory\naccesses of inputs with existing hardware. In this work, we first investigate\nthe overhead of the deformable convolution on embedded FPGA SoCs, and then show\nthe accuracy-latency tradeoffs for a set of algorithm modifications including\nfull versus depthwise, fixed-shape, and limited-range. These modifications\nbenefit the energy efficiency for embedded devices in general as they reduce\nthe compute complexity. We then build an efficient object detection network\nwith modified deformable convolutions and quantize the network using\nstate-of-the-art quantization methods.

Previous works on accident forecasting are often\nperformed on hour levels, utilizing existed neural networks with static\nregion-wise correlations taken into account. However, it is still challenging\nwhen the granularity of forecasting step improves as the highly dynamic nature\nof road network and inherent rareness of accident records in one training\nsample, which leads to biased results and zero-inflated issue. In this work, we\npropose a novel framework RiskOracle, to improve the prediction granularity to\nminute levels. Specifically, we first transform the zero-risk values in labels\nto fit the training network. Then, we propose the Differential Time-varying\nGraph neural network (DTGN) to capture the immediate changes of traffic status\nand dynamic inter-subregion correlations. Furthermore, we adopt multi-task and\nregion selection schemes to highlight citywide most-likely accident subregions,\nbridging the gap between biased risk values and sporadic accident distribution.\nExtensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness\nand scalability of our RiskOracle framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 07:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

The focus of this theory\ncomprises three distinct stages: planetary ejection, interplanetary transit and\nplanetary entry. However, it is debatable whether organisms transported within\nthe ejecta can survive all three stages. If the conjecture is granted, that\nlife can indeed be safely transmitted from one world to another, then it is not\nonly a topic pertaining to planetary science but also biological sciences.\nHence, these stages are only the first three factors of the equation. The other\nfactors for successful lithopanspermia are the quality, quantity and\nevolutionary strategy of the transmitted organisms. When expanding into new\nenvironments, invading organisms often do not survive in the first attempt and\nusually require several attempts through propagule pressure to obtain a\nfoothold. There is a crucial difference between this terrestrial situation and\nthe one brought about by lithopanspermia. While invasive species on Earth\nrepeatedly enters a new habitat, a species pragmatically arrives on another\nsolar system body only once; thus, an all-or-nothing response will be in\neffect. The species must survive in the first attempt, which limits the\nprobability of survival. In addition, evolution sets a boundary through the\nexistence of an inverse proportionality between the exchanges of life between\ntwo worlds, thus further restricting the probability of survival. However,\nterrestrial populations often encounter unpredictable and variable\nenvironmental conditions, which in turn necessitates an evolutionary response.\nThus, one evolutionary mode in particular, bet hedging, is the evolutionary\nstrategy that best smooth out this inverse proportionality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 13:43:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2020 09:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

However designing large-scale and high-performance model is\nyet a challenge due to the lack of robust training algorithms. A bio-plausible\nSNN model with spatial-temporal property is a complex dynamic system. Each\nsynapse and neuron behave as filters capable of preserving temporal\ninformation. As such neuron dynamics and filter effects are ignored in existing\ntraining algorithms, the SNN downgrades into a memoryless system and loses the\nability of temporal signal processing. Furthermore, spike timing plays an\nimportant role in information representation, but conventional rate-based spike\ncoding models only consider spike trains statistically, and discard information\ncarried by its temporal structures. To address the above issues, and exploit\nthe temporal dynamics of SNNs, we formulate SNN as a network of infinite\nimpulse response (IIR) filters with neuron nonlinearity.
