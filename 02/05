We present a suite of isothermal\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations using the GIZMO code, that resolve the\nformation of individual stars in giant molecular clouds (GMCs), spanning a\nrange of Mach numbers found in observed GMCs. As in past works, the mean and\nmedian stellar masses are sensitive to numerical resolution, because they are\nsensitive to low-mass stars that contribute a vanishing fraction of the overall\nstellar mass. The {\\em mass-weighted} median stellar mass $M_\\mathrm{50}$\nbecomes insensitive to resolution once turbulent fragmentation is\nwell-resolved.

To manipulate such properties, it is essential to\nunderstand the conditions that lead to lone pair expression and to provide a\nquantitative chemical description. Here we first use density functional theory\ncalculations to establish the presence of stereo-chemically active lone pairs\non antimony in $\\text{MnSb}_{2}\\text{O}_{4}$. The lone pairs are formed through\na similar mechanism to those in binary post-transition metal compounds in an\noxidation state of two less than their main group number, where the degree of\norbital interaction determines the expression of the lone pair. In\n$\\text{MnSb}_{2}\\text{O}_{4}$ the Sb lone pairs interact through a void space\nin the crystal structure, and they minimize their mutual repulsion by\nintroducing a deflection angle. This angle increases significantly with\ndecreasing Sb-Sb distance, thus showing the highly destabilizing nature of the\nlone pair interactions. Analysis of the chemical bonding in the structure shows\nthat it is dominated by polar covalent interactions. A database search of\nrelated ternary chalcogenide structures shows that for structures with a lone\npair the degree of lone pair expression is largely determined by whether the\nantimony-chalcogen units are connected or not, suggesting a cooperative effect.\nIsolated $\\text{SbX}_3$ units have larger X-Sb-X bond angles, and therefore\nweaker lone pair expression than connected units. Since increased lone pair\nexpression is equivalent to an increased orbital interaction (covalent\nbonding), which typically leads to increased heat conduction, this can explain\nthe previously established correlation between larger bond angles and lower\nthermal conductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 18:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

They also may only provide qualitative insights. It is\nappealing to make use of surveillance cameras and to extract user-related\ninformation through computer vision. This paper proposes a proof-of-concept\ndeep learning computer vision framework for measuring human activities\nquantitatively in POS and demonstrates a case study of the proposed framework\nusing the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy (DRFC) surveillance camera network. A\ncustom image dataset is presented to train the framework; the dataset includes\n7826 fully annotated images collected from 18 cameras across the DRFC park\nspace under various illumination conditions. Dataset analysis is also provided\nas well as a baseline model for one-step user localization and activity\nrecognition. The mAP results are 77.5\\% for {\\it pedestrian} detection and\n81.6\\% for {\\it cyclist} detection. Behavioral maps are autonomously generated\nby the framework to locate different POS users and the average error for\nbehavioral localization is within 10 cm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 18:38:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

The\nkey question is whether this reflects a causal connection - can star formation\nbe quenched dynamically by bulges or the spheroids of early-type galaxies? We\nsystematically investigate the impact of these morphological components on star\nformation, by performing a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of isolated\ngalaxies containing a spheroid. We vary the bulge mass and scale radius, while\nthe total initial stellar, halo and gas mass are kept constant, with a gas\nfraction of 5 per cent. In addition, we consider two different sub-grid star\nformation prescriptions. The first follows most simulations in the literature\nby assuming a constant star formation efficiency per free-fall time, whereas in\nthe second model it depends on the gas virial parameter, following\nhigh-resolution simulations of turbulent fragmentation. Across all simulations,\ncentral spheroids increase the gas velocity dispersion towards the galactic\ncentre. This increases the gravitational stability of the gas disc, suppresses\nfragmentation and star formation, and results in galaxies hosting extremely\nsmooth and quiescent gas discs that fall below the galaxy main sequence. These\neffects amplify when using the more sophisticated, dynamics-dependent star\nformation model. Finally, we discover a pronounced relation between the central\nstellar surface density and star formation rate (SFR), such that the most\nbulge-dominated galaxies show the strongest deviation from the main sequence.\nWe conclude that the SFR of galaxies is not only set by the balance between\naccretion and feedback, but carries a (sometimes dominant) dependence on the\ngravitational potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 15:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-08"}

It is important to get as much science as possible out of this\nlimited observing time. We provide an analysis framework (including publicly\nreleased computational tools) that can be used to optimize lists of exoplanet\ntargets for atmospheric characterization. Our tools take catalogs of planet\ndetections, either simulated, or actual; categorize the targets by planet\nradius and equilibrium temperature; estimate planet masses; generate model\nspectra and simulated instrument spectra; perform a statistical analysis to\ndetermine if the instrument spectra can confirm an atmospheric detection; and\nfinally, rank the targets within each category by observation time required.\nFor a catalog of simulated Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite planet\ndetections, we determine an optimal target ranking for the observing time\navailable. Our results are generally consistent with other recent studies of\nJWST exoplanet target optimization. We show that assumptions about target\nplanet atmospheric metallicity, instrument performance (especially the noise\nfloor), and statistical detection threshold, can have a significant effect on\ntarget ranking.

We aim to quantify both the prevalence of password length\nleakage bugs as well as the potential harm to users. In an observational study,\nwe find that {\\em most} of the Alexa top 100 rates sites are vulnerable to\nbicycle attacks meaning that an eavesdropping attacker can infer the exact\nlength of a password based on the length the encrypted packet containing the\npassword. We discuss several ways in which an eavesdropping attacker could link\nthis password length with a particular user account e.g., a targeted campaign\nagainst a smaller group of users or via DNS hijacking for larger scale\ncampaigns. We next use a decision-theoretic model to quantify the extent to\nwhich password length leakage might help an attacker to crack user passwords.\nIn our analysis, we consider three different levels of password attackers:\nhacker, criminal and nation-state. In all cases, we find that such an attacker\nwho knows the length of each user password gains a significant advantage over\none without knowing the password length. As part of this analysis, we also\nrelease a new differentially private password frequency dataset from the 2016\nLinkedIn breach using a differentially private algorithm of Blocki et al. (NDSS\n2016) to protect user accounts. The LinkedIn frequency corpus is based on over\n170 million passwords making it the largest frequency corpus publicly available\nto password researchers. While the defense against bicycle attacks is\nstraightforward (i.e., ensure that passwords are always padded before\nencryption), we discuss several practical challenges organizations may face\nwhen attempting to patch this vulnerability. We advocate for a new W3C standard\non how password fields are handled which would effectively eliminate most\ninstances of password length leakage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 19:34:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-06"}

When light is used as the probe, the SQL arises from the balance between\nthe uncertainties of photon radiation pressure imposed on the object and of the\nphoton number in the photoelectric detection.

Photonic Force Microscopy (PhFM), based on\noptical tweezers (OT), represents an interesting alternative for soft\nscanning-probe microscopy. Using light instead of a physical cantilever to hold\nthe scanning probe results in a stiffness ($k_{OT}\\sim0.1-0.001$ pN/nm) which\ncan be 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than that of standard cantilevers\n($k_{AFM}\\sim 10$ pN/nm).

We validate our approach\nusing audiometric data from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and\nHealth NIOSH. Initial results show that with a few tones we can detect if the\npatient's audiometric function has changed between the two test sessions with\nhigh confidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 21:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-06"}

First, even those clients interested in the same content might\nrequest different quality levels as a video content is encoded into multiple\nqualities to match a wide range of network conditions and device capabilities.\nSecond, the clients, who select the quality of the next chunk to request, are\nunaware of the cached content at the network edge. Hence, it becomes imperative\nto develop network-side solutions to exploit caching. This can also mitigate\nsome performance issues, in particular for the scenarios in which multiple\nvideo clients compete for some bottleneck capacity. In this paper, we propose a\nnetwork-side control logic running at a WiFi AP to facilitate the use of cached\nvideo content. In particular, an AP can assign a client station a different\nvideo quality than its request, in case the alternative quality provides a\nbetter utility. We formulate the quality assignment problem as an optimization\nproblem and develop several heuristics with polynomial complexity. Compared to\nthe baseline where the clients determine the quality adaptation, our proposals,\nreferred to as EdgeDASH, offer higher video quality, higher cache hits, and\nlower stalling ratio which are essential for user's satisfaction. Our\nsimulations show that EdgeDASH facilitates significant cache hits and decreases\nthe buffer stalls only by changing the client's request by one quality level.\nMoreover, from our analysis, we conclude that the network assistance provides\nsignificant performance improvement, especially when the clients with identical\ninterests compete for a bottleneck link's capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 21:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-06"}

The current study focused on the sense of agency (SoA),\na specific aspect of agency referring to congruence between the agent's\nintention in acting and the outcome. Employing predictive coding and active\ninference as theoretical frameworks of perception and action generation, we\nhypothesize that regulation of complexity in the evidence lower bound of an\nagent's model should affect the strength of the agent's SoA and should have a\ncritical impact on social interactions. We built a computational model of\nimitative interaction between a robot and a human via visuo-proprioceptive\nsensation with a variational Bayes recurrent neural network, and simulated the\nmodel in the form of pseudo-imitative interaction using recorded human body\nmovement data. A key feature of the model is that each modality's complexity\ncan be regulated differently with a hyperparameter assigned to each module. We\nfirst searched for an optimal setting that endows the model with appropriate\ncoordination of multimodal sensation. This revealed that the vision module's\ncomplexity should be more tightly regulated than that of the proprioception\nmodule. Using the optimally trained model, we examined how changing the\ntightness of complexity regulation after training affects the strength of the\nSoA during interactions. The results showed that with looser regulation, an\nagent tends to act more egocentrically, without adapting to the other.

However, the\nphase and amplitude response of the induced fields will be influenced by the\nincreasing electrical conductivity along oceans' convective adiabatic\ntemperature profiles. Here, we examine the amplitudes and phase lags for\nmagnetic diffusion in modeled oceans of Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. We\nrestrict our analysis to spherically symmetric configurations, treating\ninterior structures based on self-consistent thermodynamics, which account for\nvariations in electrical conductivity with depth in convective oceans (Vance et\nal., 2018). The numerical approach considers tens of radial layers. The\ninduction response of the adiabatic conductivity profile differs from oceans\nwith uniform conductivity based on the ice-ocean interface or the mean value of\nthe adiabatic profile by more than 10% in many cases.

Community structure is well known to\nbe a feature of brain networks, typically corresponding to different regions of\nthe brain responsible for different functions.

Recently, the\nphonon angular momentum (PAM), which is the angular momentum of atoms as a\nresult of their orbital motion around their equilibrium positions, has garnered\nattention as a quantity analogous to the magnon spin. However, can we\nmanipulate PAM like magnon spin? Here, we show that temperature gradient\ngenerally induces a transverse flow of PAM, which we term the phonon angular\nmomentum Hall effect (PAMHE). The PAMHE relies only on the presence of\ntransverse and longitudinal acoustic phonons, and it is therefore ubiquitous in\ncondensed matter systems. As a consequence of the PAMHE, PAM accumulates at the\nedges of a crystal. When the atoms in the crystal carry nonzero Born effective\ncharge, the edge PAM induces edge magnetization, which may be observed through\noptical measurement.

To tackle the challenge, the Concept-harmonized\nHierArchical INference (CHAIN) is proposed to interpret the net decision-making\nprocess. For net-decisions being interpreted, the proposed method presents the\nCHAIN interpretation in which the net decision can be hierarchically deduced\ninto visual concepts from high to low semantic levels. To achieve it, we\npropose three models sequentially, i.e., the concept harmonizing model, the\nhierarchical inference model, and the concept-harmonized hierarchical inference\nmodel. Firstly, in the concept harmonizing model, visual concepts from high to\nlow semantic-levels are aligned with net-units from deep to shallow layers.\nSecondly, in the hierarchical inference model, the concept in a deep layer is\ndisassembled into units in shallow layers. Finally, in the concept-harmonized\nhierarchical inference model, a deep-layer concept is inferred from its\nshallow-layer concepts. After several rounds, the concept-harmonized\nhierarchical inference is conducted backward from the highest semantic level to\nthe lowest semantic level. Finally, net decision-making is explained as a form\nof concept-harmonized hierarchical inference, which is comparable to human\ndecision-making.

At each of these regimes, the appropriate IV and LFN parameters can\nbe accurately extracted. Regarding LFN, mobility fluctuation effect is dominant\nat CNP and from there the Hooge parameter aH can be extracted while the carrier\nnumber fluctuation contribution which is responsible for the well-known M-shape\nbias dependence of output noise divided by squared drain current, also observed\nin our data, makes possible the extraction of the NT parameter related to the\nnumber of traps. In the less possible case of a Lambda-shape trend, NT and aH\ncan be extracted simultaneously from the region near CNP.

The results show that the recovered\nsignal could be attenuated by low angular resolution of the map or large\naperture photometry filter radius size, but the mean radial velocity profile\ncan be fully recovered with our estimator. By applying the estimator to the\nPlanck 2D-ILC CMB map, with galaxy and void catalogues from BOSS DR12, we find\nthat the estimated void velocity profile is $3.31\\sigma$ apart from null\ndetection for for voids with continuously rising density profiles asymptoting\nto the mean density; and $1.75\\sigma$ for voids with positive density contrast\nshell surrounded.

There are two ways that lens\nmodels can solve the over-pressure problem: a confinement mechanism exists to\ncounter the internal pressure of the lens, or the lens has a unique geometry,\nsuch that the projected column-density appears large to an observer. This\noccurs with highly asymmetric models, such as edge-on sheets or filaments, with\npotentially low volume-density. In the first part of this work we investigate\nthe ability of non-magnetized plasma filaments to mimic the magnification of\nsources seen behind spherical lenses and we extend a theorem from gravitational\nlens studies regarding this model degeneracy.

In the ETAS framework, the\noccurrence of the mainshock earthquakes in a geographical region is assumed to\nfollow an inhomogeneous spatial point process, and aftershock events are then\nmodelled via a separate triggering kernel. Most previous studies of the ETAS\nmodel have relied on point estimates of the model parameters due to the\ncomplexity of the likelihood function, and the difficulty in estimating an\nappropriate mainshock distribution. In order to take estimation uncertainty\ninto account, we instead propose a fully Bayesian formulation of the ETAS model\nwhich uses a nonparametric Dirichlet process mixture prior to capture the\nspatial mainshock process. Direct inference for the resulting model is\nproblematic due to the strong correlation of the parameters for the mainshock\nand triggering processes, so we instead use an auxiliary latent variable\nroutine to perform efficient inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 10:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-06"}

Here this problem is\nanalyzed analytically and numerically. A modified sine-Gordon type equation in\nthe presence of time-dependent local field is derived and solved numerically in\nstatic and dynamic cases. Two specific examples of local fields are considered:\ninduced either by an Abrikosov vortex, or by a tip of a magnetic force\nmicroscope (MFM). It is demonstrated that time-dependent local field can induce\na dynamic flux-flow state in the junction with shuttling, or unidirectional\nratchet-like Josephson vortex motion. This provides a mechanism of detection\nand manipulation of Josephson vortices by an oscillating MFM tip. In a static\ncase local field leads to a distortion of the critical current versus magnetic\nfield, $I_c(H)$, modulation pattern. The distortion is sensitive to both the\nshape and the amplitude of the local field. Therefore, the $I_c(H)$ pattern\ncarries information about the local field distribution within the junction.\nThis opens a possibility for employing a single Josephson junction as a\nscanning probe sensor with spatial resolution not limited by its geometrical\nsize, thus obviating a known problem of a trade-off between field sensitivity\nand spatial resolution of a sensor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 10:33:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

This study provides a solid\nfoundation for research on QA technologies of big data applications. However,\nmany challenges of big data applications regarding quality still remain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 12:40:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 05:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-07"}

With an additional 229 radial velocity measurements\nobtained since the discovery publication, we reanalyze the YZ Ceti system and\nresolve the alias issues. We use model comparison in the framework of Bayesian\nstatistics and periodogram simulations based on a method by Dawson and Fabrycky\nto resolve the aliases. We discuss additional signals in the RV data, and\nderive the planetary parameters by simultaneously modeling the stellar activity\nwith a Gaussian process regression model. To constrain the planetary parameters\nfurther we apply a stability analysis on our ensemble of Keplerian fits. We\nresolve the aliases: the three planets orbit the star with periods of $2.02$ d,\n$3.06$ d, and $4.66$ d. We also investigate an effect of the stellar rotational\nsignal on the derivation of the planetary parameters, in particular the\neccentricity of the innermost planet. Using photometry we determine the stellar\nrotational period to be close to $68$ d. From the absence of a transit event\nwith TESS, we derive an upper limit of the inclination of $i_\\mathrm{max} =\n87.43$ deg. YZ Ceti is a prime example of a system where strong aliasing\nhindered the determination of the orbital periods of exoplanets.

The\nmain motivation of the present analysis is to prepare the future observations\nof the evolved stellar populations of Local Group galaxies that will be done by\nthe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), by identifying the combination of\nfilters that will maximize the possibilities of characterizing the observed\nsources. The present results show that for the M-star case the best planes to\nbe used for this purpose are the colour-magnitude ([F770W]-[F2550W], [F770W])\nand (Ks-[F770W], [F770W]) planes. In these observational diagrams the sequences\nof low-mass stars evolving in the AGB phases before the achievement of the\nC-star stage and of massive AGBs experiencing hot bottom burning are clearly\nseparated and peculiar sources, such as post-AGB, dual-dust chemistry and\niron-dust stars can be easily identified\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 14:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

One distinctive and\nmeasurable effect associated with this aspect of the theory is the nonlinear GW\nmemory effect. The GW memory effect is characterized by its effect on freely\nfalling observers: the proper distance between their locations differs before\nand after a burst of GWs passes by their locations. Gravitational-wave\ninterferometers, like the LIGO and Virgo detectors, can measure features of\nthis effect from a single BBH merger, but previous work has shown that it will\nrequire an event that is significantly more massive and closer than any\npreviously detected GW event. Finding evidence for the GW memory effect within\nthe entire population of BBH mergers detected by LIGO and Virgo is more likely\nto occur sooner. A prior study has shown that the GW memory effect could be\ndetected in a population of BBHs consisting of binaries like the first GW150914\nevent after roughly one-hundred events. In this paper, we compute forecasts of\nthe time it will take the advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors (when the detectors\nare operating at their design sensitivities) to find evidence for the GW memory\neffect in a population of BBHs that is consistent with the measured population\nof events in the first two observing runs of the LIGO detectors.

Using a semi-analytical real options framework, we derive the project\nvalue, the optimal investment threshold, and the value of the investment\nopportunity for these schemes. Taking into consideration the optimal investment\nthreshold, we also compare the two aforementioned FITs with the fixed-price FIT\nand the fixed-premium FIT, which are policy schemes that have been extensively\nstudied in the literature.

An important property of such a system is\nallowing the user to specify conditions and desired properties of the generated\nmusic. In this paper we designed a model for composing melodies given a user\nspecified symbolic scenario combined with a previous music context. We add\nmanual labeled vectors denoting external music quality in terms of chord\nfunction that provides a low dimensional representation of the harmonic tension\nand resolution. Our model is capable of generating long melodies by regarding\n8-beat note sequences as basic units, and shares consistent rhythm pattern\nstructure with another specific song. The model contains two stages and\nrequires separate training where the first stage adopts a Conditional\nVariational Autoencoder (C-VAE) to build a bijection between note sequences and\ntheir latent representations, and the second stage adopts long short-term\nmemory networks (LSTM) with structural conditions to continue writing future\nmelodies. We further exploit the disentanglement technique via C-VAE to allow\nmelody generation based on pitch contour information separately from\nconditioning on rhythm patterns. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model using\nquantitative analysis of rhythm and the subjective listening study. Results\nshow that the music generated by our model tends to have salient repetition\nstructures, rich motives, and stable rhythm patterns. The ability to generate\nlonger and more structural phrases from disentangled representations combined\nwith semantic scenario specification conditions shows a broad application of\nour model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 06:23:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

This paper evaluates the role of tactile information on autonomous\nlearning of manipulation with a simulated 3-finger tendon-driven hand. We\ncompare the ability of the same learning algorithm (Proximal Policy\nOptimization, PPO) to learn two manipulation tasks (rolling a ball about the\nhorizontal axis with and without rotational stiffness) with three levels of\ntactile sensing: no sensing, 1D normal force, and 3D force vector.\nSurprisingly, and contrary to recent work on manipulation, adding 1D\nforce-sensing did not always improve learning rates compared to no\nsensing---likely due to whether or not normal force is relevant to the task.\nNonetheless, even though 3D force-sensing increases the dimensionality of the\nsensory input---which would in general hamper algorithm convergence---it\nresulted in faster learning rates and better performance. We conclude that, in\ngeneral, sensory input is useful to learning only when it is relevant to the\ntask---as is the case of 3D force-sensing for in-hand manipulation against\ngravity.

Passive WiFi sensing, by collecting WiFi probe requests sent from\nmobile devices, provides a better way to monitor crowds compared with people\ncounters and cameras in terms of free interference, larger coverage, lower\ncost, and more information on people's movement. In existing studies, however,\nnot enough attention has been paid to the thorough analysis and mining of\ncollected data. Especially, the power of machine learning has not been fully\nexploited. In this paper, therefore, we propose a comprehensive data analysis\nframework to fully analyze the collected probe requests to extract three types\nof patterns related to crowd behaviors in a large social event, with the help\nof statistics, visualization, and unsupervised machine learning. First,\ntrajectories of the mobile devices are extracted from probe requests and\nanalyzed to reveal the spatial patterns of the crowds' movement. Hierarchical\nagglomerative clustering is adopted to find the interconnections between\ndifferent locations. Next, k-means and k-shape clustering algorithms are\napplied to extract temporal visiting patterns of the crowds by days and\nlocations, respectively. Finally, by combining with time, trajectories are\ntransformed into spatiotemporal patterns, which reveal how trajectory duration\nchanges over the length and how the overall trends of crowd movement change\nover time. The proposed data analysis framework is fully demonstrated using\nreal-world data collected in a large social event. Results show that one can\nextract comprehensive patterns from data collected by a network of passive WiFi\nsensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 03:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

These findings open\nthe pathway for size limits indication and regimes modulation where the\nalloy-based nano-mechanical devices can be tuned to operate more efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 19:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

It does not usually\nattract much attention, because the shift is considered to be negligibly small\nand the following self-alignment effect in the solder paste reflow soldering\nprocess could also make it up. However, with the decreasing size of the\nelectronic components and the increasing demand for the low defective rate of\nPCB, the component shift in P&P process is becoming more and more important in\nquality control of SMT industries. Though a few papers are related to the\ncomponent shift in P&P process, there is no earlier research using the data\nfrom the real production line. In this paper, we study two basic and important\nissues: the behavior of the component shift in P&P process and the contributing\nfactors to it. Several statistical methods are used to explore the behavior\ncomponent shift based on the data from a complete state-of-the-art SMT assembly\nline. Main effects and regression analysis are implemented to pinpoint the\ncontributing factors. In order to investigate the issues comprehensively, six\ntypes of electronic components and multiple potential factors are considered in\nthis work, e.g., solder paste properties (position, volume, area, height),\ndesigned position of the component, placement pressure. The results indicate\nthat component shift cannot be ignored. Also, the position of solder paste,\ndesigned position of component and component type are the top three most\nimportant factors to study the component shifts in P&P process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 20:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

However, these approaches do not address people's individual\npreferences. In the research presented, we aim to address this lack with\nregards to inspirations. In a first step, we conducted a co-located\nbrainstorming study with 15 participants, which allowed us to differentiate two\ntypes of ideators: Inspiration seekers and inspiration avoiders. These insights\ninformed the study design of the second step, where we propose a user model for\nclassifying people depending on their ideator types, which was translated into\na rule-based and a random forest-based classifier. We evaluated the validity of\nour user model by conducting an online experiment with 380 participants. The\nresults confirmed our proposed ideator types, showing that, while seekers\nbenefit from the availability of inspiration, avoiders were influenced\nnegatively. The random forest classifier enabled us to differentiate people\nwith a 73 \\% accuracy after only three minutes of ideation. These insights show\nthat the proposed ideator types are a promising user model for large-scale\nideation. In future work, this distinction may help to design more personalized\nlarge-scale ideation systems that recommend inspirations adaptively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 12:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-24"}

These are of Kepler-Coulomb and harmonic oscillator\ntype. Volker Perlick recently designed new static spherically symmetric\n(Bertrand) spacetimes obeying Einstein's equations and supporting closed\norbits. In this work we demonstrate that the topology and geometry of these\nspacetimes permits us to solve quantum many-body problem for any atom of\nperiodic system exactly. The computations of spectrum for any atom are\nanalogous to that for hydrogen atom. Initially, the exact solution of the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for any multielectron atom (without reference to\nBertrand theorem) was obtained by Tietz in 1956. We recalculated Tietz results\nby applying the methodology consistent with new (different from that developed\nby Fock in 1936) way of solving Schr\\\"odinger's equation for hydrogen atom. By\nusing this new methodology it had become possible to demonstrate that the\nTietz-type Schr\\\"odinger's equation is in fact describing the quantum motion in\nBertrand spacetimes. As a bonus, we solved analytically the L\\\"owdin's\nchallenge problem. Obtained solution is not universal though since there are\nexceptions of the Madelung rule in transition metals and among lanthanides and\nactinides. Quantum mechanically these exceptions as well as the rule itself are\ntreated thus far with help of relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations. The\nobtained results do not describe the exceptions in detail yet. However, studies\noutlined in this paper indicate that developed methods are capable of\ndescribing exceptions as well. The paper ends with some remarks about\nusefulness of problems of atomic physics for development of quantum mechanics,\nquantum field theory and (teleparallel) gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 01:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-28"}
