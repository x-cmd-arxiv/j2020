Existing works either address one part of this\nproblem or focus on independent objects. In this paper, we bridge the gap\nbetween understanding and reconstruction, and propose an end-to-end solution to\njointly reconstruct room layout, object bounding boxes and meshes from a single\nimage. Instead of separately resolving scene understanding and object\nreconstruction, our method builds upon a holistic scene context and proposes a\ncoarse-to-fine hierarchy with three components: 1. room layout with camera\npose; 2. 3D object bounding boxes; 3. object meshes. We argue that\nunderstanding the context of each component can assist the task of parsing the\nothers, which enables joint understanding and reconstruction. The experiments\non the SUN RGB-D and Pix3D datasets demonstrate that our method consistently\noutperforms existing methods in indoor layout estimation, 3D object detection\nand mesh reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 16:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-28"}

Another problem is that\nthey are applicable only to the specific condition of data that they are\nsupervised. For instance, the low-resolution (LR) image should be a \"bicubic\"\ndownsampled noise-free image from a high-resolution (HR) one. To address both\nissues, zero-shot super-resolution (ZSSR) has been proposed for flexible\ninternal learning. However, they require thousands of gradient updates, i.e.,\nlong inference time. In this paper, we present Meta-Transfer Learning for\nZero-Shot Super-Resolution (MZSR), which leverages ZSSR. Precisely, it is based\non finding a generic initial parameter that is suitable for internal learning.\nThus, we can exploit both external and internal information, where one single\ngradient update can yield quite considerable results. (See Figure 1). With our\nmethod, the network can quickly adapt to a given image condition. In this\nrespect, our method can be applied to a large spectrum of image conditions\nwithin a fast adaptation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 16:01:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-28"}

However, decision makers also need to take the operational and\nproduction needs into consideration for optimal decision-making when scheduling\nmaintenance activities. Particularly in network systems, such as power grids,\ndecisions on the maintenance of single assets can affect the entire network and\nare, therefore, more complex. This paper proposes a two-level multi-agent\ndecision support systems for the generation maintenance decision (GMS) of power\ngrids in an electricity markets. The aim of the GMS is to minimize the\ngeneration cost while maximizing the system reliability. The proposed framework\nintegrates a central coordination system, i.e. the transmission system operator\n(TSO), and distributed agents representing power generation units that act to\nmaximize their profit and decide about the optimal maintenance time slots while\nensuring the fulfilment of the energy demand. The objective function of agents\n(power generation companies) is based on the reward and the penalty that they\nobtain from the interplay between power production and loss of production due\nto failure, respectively. The optimal strategy of agents is then derived using\na distributed algorithm, where agents choose their optimal maintenance decision\nand send their decisions to the central coordinating system. The TSO decides\nwhether to accept the agents' decisions by considering the market reliability\naspects and power supply constraints. To solve this coordination problem, we\npropose a negotiation algorithm using an incentive signal to coordinate the\nagents' and central system's decisions such that all the agents' decisions can\nbe accepted by the central system.

In this paper, we introduce Woodbury transformations,\nwhich achieve efficient invertibility via the Woodbury matrix identity and\nefficient determinant calculation via Sylvester's determinant identity. In\ncontrast with other operations used in state-of-the-art normalizing flows,\nWoodbury transformations enable (1) high-dimensional interactions, (2)\nefficient sampling, and (3) efficient likelihood evaluation. Other similar\noperations, such as 1x1 convolutions, emerging convolutions, or periodic\nconvolutions allow at most two of these three advantages. In our experiments on\nmultiple image datasets, we find that Woodbury transformations allow learning\nof higher-likelihood models than other flow architectures while still enjoying\ntheir efficiency advantages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 16:21:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 01:56:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 15:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-11"}

The majority of the corresponding\nresearch has focused on information diffusion independently, ignoring the\nnetwork evolution in the diffusion process. Therefore, it is more reasonable to\ndescribe the real diffusion systems by the co-evolution between network\ntopologies and information states. In this work, we propose a mechanism\nconsidering the coevolution between information states and network topology\nsimultaneously, in which the information diffusion was executed as an SIS\nprocess and network topology evolved based on the adaptive assumption. The\ntheoretical analyses based on the Markov approach were very consistent with\nsimulation. Both simulation results and theoretical analyses indicated that the\nadaptive process, in which informed individuals would rewire the links between\nthe informed neighbors to a random non-neighbor node, can enhance information\ndiffusion (leading to much broader spreading). In addition, we obtained that\ntwo threshold values exist for the information diffusion on adaptive networks,\ni.e., if the information propagation probability is less than the first\nthreshold, information cannot diffuse and dies out immediately; if the\npropagation probability is between the first and second threshold, information\nwill spread to a finite range and die out gradually; and if the propagation\nprobability is larger than the second threshold, information will diffuse to a\ncertain size of population in the network. These results may shed some light on\nunderstanding the co-evolution between information diffusion and network\ntopology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 16:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-28"}

Mismatches in the dynamic model of the robots, numerical\nsingularities, and the intrinsic environmental unpredictability are all\ncontributing factors. Online optimization of impedance controllers has recently\nshown great promise in addressing this challenge, however, their performance is\nnot sufficiently robust to be deployed in challenging environments. This work\nproposes a compliant control method for redundant manipulators based on a\nsuperimposition of multiple passive task-space controllers in a hierarchy. Our\ncontrol framework of passive controllers is inherently stable, numerically\nwell-conditioned (as no matrix inversions are required), and computationally\ninexpensive (as no optimization is used). We leverage and introduce a novel\nstiffness profile for a recently proposed passive controller with smooth\ntransitions between the divergence and convergence phases making it\nparticularly suitable when multiple passive controllers are combined through\nsuperimposition. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieves sub-centimeter tracking performance during demanding dynamic tasks\nwith fast-changing references, while remaining safe to interact with and robust\nto singularities. he proposed framework achieves such results without knowledge\nof the robot dynamics and thanks to its passivity is intrinsically stable. The\ndata further show that the robot can fully take advantage of the redundancy to\nmaintain the primary task accuracy while compensating for unknown environmental\ninteractions, which is not possible from current frameworks that require\naccurate contact information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 16:46:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 11:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

Current approaches cannot handle huge crowd\ndiversity well and thus perform poorly in extreme cases, where the crowd\ndensity in different regions of an image is either too low or too high, leading\nto crowd underestimation or overestimation. The proposed solution is based on\nthe observation that detecting and handling such extreme cases in a specialized\nway leads to better crowd estimation. Additionally, existing methods find it\nhard to differentiate between the actual crowd and the cluttered background\nregions, resulting in further count overestimation. To address these issues, we\npropose a simple yet effective modular approach, where an input image is first\nsubdivided into fixed-size patches and then fed to a four-way classification\nmodule labeling each image patch as low, medium, high-dense or no-crowd. This\nmodule also provides a count for each label, which is then analyzed via a\nspecifically devised novel decision module to decide whether the image belongs\nto any of the two extreme cases (very low or very high density) or a normal\ncase. Images, specified as high- or low-density extreme or a normal case, pass\nthrough dedicated zooming or normal patch-making blocks respectively before\nrouting to the regressor in the form of fixed-size patches for crowd estimate.\nExtensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks under most of the\nevaluation criteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 16:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-28"}

The model accounts for (1) different\ntransmissivities of the epidemic on different transportation media, (2) the\ntransit of inbound flow at cities, (3) cross-infection on public transportation\nvehicles due to path overlap, and the realistic considerations that (4) the\ninfected population are not entering public transportation and (5) the\nrecovered population are not subject to repeated infections.

In this regime our proof relies on a new type of\nPeierls argument which we call annealed Peierls argument and which allows us to\ndeal with an unknown quenched groundstate.\n  -) If $T>T_{rec}^+$, it is impossible to fully recover the field $\\phi$ from\nthe knowledge of $\\phi \\pmod{\\frac {2\\pi} T}$. To prove this result, we\ngeneralise the delocalisation theorem by Fr\\\"ohlich-Spencer to the case of\ninteger-valued GFF in an inhomogeneous medium. This delocalisation result is of\nindependent interest and we give an application of our techniques to the {\\em\nrandom-phase Sine-Gordon model} in Appendix B. Also, an interesting connection\nwith Riemann-theta functions is drawn along the proof.\n  This statistical reconstruction problem is motivated by the two-dimensional\nXY and Villain models. Indeed, at low-temperature $T$, the large scale\nfluctuations of these continuous spin systems are conjectured to be governed by\na Gaussian free field. It is then natural to ask if one can recover the\nunderlying macroscopic GFF from the observation of the spins of the XY or\nVillain model.\n  Another motivation for this work is that it provides us with an ``integrable\nmodel'' (the GFF) that undergoes a KT transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 17:49:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 17:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

However, retraining or\ncustomizing a model is required at edge devices as the model is becoming\noutdated due to environmental changes over time. To follow such a concept\ndrift, a neural-network based on-device learning approach is recently proposed,\nso that edge devices train incoming data at runtime to update their model. In\nthis case, since a training is done at distributed edge devices, the issue is\nthat only a limited amount of training data can be used for each edge device.\nTo address this issue, one approach is a cooperative learning or federated\nlearning, where edge devices exchange their trained results and update their\nmodel by using those collected from the other devices. In this paper, as an\non-device learning algorithm, we focus on OS-ELM (Online Sequential Extreme\nLearning Machine) to sequentially train a model based on recent samples and\ncombine it with autoencoder for anomaly detection. We extend it for an\non-device federated learning so that edge devices can exchange their trained\nresults and update their model by using those collected from the other edge\ndevices. This cooperative model update is one-shot while it can be repeatedly\napplied to synchronize their model. Our approach is evaluated with anomaly\ndetection tasks generated from a driving dataset of cars, a human activity\ndataset, and MNIST dataset.

The temperature dependencies of the lineshape\nparameters of some Raman-active vibrations near to the\nantiferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition infers for a significant\nspin-lattice coupling in this compound.

We investigate elementary excitations around the mean-field\nsteady state and their consequences for the coherence properties. In\nparticular, we show that the hybridization of chiral edge modes gives rise to\nlong-lived elementary excitations, leading to large phase fluctuations in the\nemitted light field and a decrease of light coherence. In contrast to\ntopologically trivial lasers, the lifetime of elementary excitations is robust\nagainst disorder in topological lasers. However, the lifetime strongly depends\non the edge-mode dispersion around the lasing frequency. As a result, the\nlifetime can be reduced by orders of magnitude for lasing of different edge\nmodes, leading to a suppression of phase fluctuations and larger coherence of\nthe emitted light. On the other hand, amplitude fluctuations and the\nsecond-order autocorrelation function are moderately increased at the same\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 18:55:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 08:04:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 19:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

Here, we introduce a simple model of three antiferromagnetically\ncoupled Kondo impurities, a Kondo triangle, which can be used to further extend\nthe application of these concepts to electronic systems. We show that, by\ntuning the magnetic frustration, the Kondo triangle undergoes a quantum phase\ntransition between two phases of unbroken symmetry, signaling a phase\ntransition beyond the Landau paradigm. We demonstrate that the frustrated spin\nliquid phase is described by a three-channel Kondo (3CK) fixed point and thus\ndisplays an irrational ground state degeneracy. Using an Abrikosov\npseudofermion representation, this quantum state is categorized by an emergent\nU(1) gauge field and its projective symmetry group. The gauge theory is\ndeconfining in the sense that a miniature Wilson loop orders and topological\ndefects (instantons in the gauge field) are expelled. This phase persists in\nthe presence of moderate Kondo screening until proliferation of topological\ndefects leads to a quantum phase transition to an unfrustrated Fermi liquid\nphase. Based on this evidence, we propose that the 3CK phase displays\ntopological order in a similar sense as gapless spin liquids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 18:56:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 07:45:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 11:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

The key idea of our approach is to deploy 3D shearlets as a\nspace-temporal prior, treating time as the third dimension. The rationale\nbehind this model is that a continuous evolution of a cartoon-like object is\nwell suited for the use of 3D shearlets.

Those that have been conducted\nfocused on using classification performance, e.g., Inception Score (IS) and\nstatistical metrics, e.g., Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID). Here, we\nconsider a fundamental way to evaluate GANs by directly analyzing the images\nthey generate, instead of using them as inputs to other classifiers.

A\nGAN should not generate a few different images repeatedly. Based on the three\naspects of ideal GANs, we have designed the Likeness Score (LS) to evaluate GAN\nperformance, and have applied it to evaluate several typical GANs.

Active region\nobservations offer exceptional views of wave behavior and its impact on the\nsurrounding atmosphere. The stratified plasma gradients present in the lower\nsolar atmosphere allow for the potential formation of many theorized shock\nphenomena. In this study, using chromospheric Ca II 854.2nm spectropolarimetric\ndata of a large sunspot, we examine fluctuations in the plasma parameters in\nthe aftermath of powerful shock events that demonstrate polarimetric reversals\nduring their evolution. Modern inversion techniques are employed to uncover\nperturbations in the temperatures, line-of-sight velocities, and vector\nmagnetic fields occurring across a range of optical depths synonymous with the\nshock formation. Classification of these non-linear signatures is carried out\nby comparing the observationally-derived slow, fast, and Alfv\\'en shock\nsolutions to the theoretical Rankine-Hugoniot relations.

The statistical\nconfidence of such an experiment is typically expressed as the number of\nobserved standard deviations of witness violations. This method implicitly\nassumes that the noise is well-behaved so that the central limit theorem\napplies. In this work, we propose two methods to analyze witness experiments\nwhere the states can be subject to arbitrarily correlated noise. Our first\nmethod is a rejection experiment, in which we certify the creation of\nentanglement by rejecting the hypothesis that the experiment can only produce\nseparable states. We quantify the statistical confidence by a p-value, which\ncan be interpreted as the likelihood that the observed data is consistent with\nthe hypothesis that only separable states can be produced. Hence a small\np-value implies large confidence in the witnessed entanglement. The method\napplies to general witness experiments and can also be used to witness genuine\nmultipartite entanglement. Our second method is an estimation experiment, in\nwhich we estimate and construct confidence intervals for the average witness\nvalue. This confidence interval is statistically rigorous in the presence of\ncorrelated noise. The method applies to general estimation problems, including\nfidelity estimation. To account for systematic measurement and random setting\ngeneration errors, our model takes into account device imperfections and we\nshow how this affects both methods of statistical analysis.

Recent theories suggest that\nexisting signaling systems have evolved through natural selection imposed by\npredators. Honest signaling in the interspecific communication can provide\ninsight into the evolution of anti-predation techniques. In this work, we\nintroduce a deterministic three-stage, two-species predator-prey model, which\nmodulates the impact of honest signals and cues on the interacting populations.\nThe model is built from a set of first principles originated from signaling and\nsocial learning theory in which the response of predators to transmitted honest\nsignals or cues is determined. The predators then use the signals to decide\nwhether to pursue the attack or save their energy for an easier catch. Other\nmembers from the prey population that are not familiar with signaling their\nfitness observe and learn the technique. Our numerical bifurcation analysis\nindicates that increasing the predator's search rate and the corresponding\nassimilation efficiency gives a journey from predator-prey abundance and\nscarcity, a stable transient cycle between persistence and near-extinction, a\nhomoclinic orbit pointing towards extinction, and ultimately, a quasi-periodic\norbit. A similar discovery is met under the increment of the prey's intrinsic\nbirth rate and carrying capacity. When both parameters are of sufficiently\nlarge magnitudes, the separator between honest signal and cue takes the similar\njourney from a stable equilibrium to a quasi-periodic orbit as it increases. In\nthe context of modeling, we conclude that under prey abundance, transmitting\nerror-free honest signals leads to not only a stable but also more predictable\npredator-prey dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 20:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-02"}

This decomposition and encoding\nprocesses lead to the obfuscation of the high-level constraints and a loss of\ninformation on the structure of the combinatorial model. In \\us{}, constraints\nover the floats are first class objects, and the purpose is to expose and\nexploit structures of floating point domains to enhance the search process. A\nsymbolic phase rewrites each SMTLIB instance to elementary constraints, and\neliminates auxiliary variables whose presence is counterproductive.

This limits the use of such algorithms in biological problems,\nwhere features such as genes often work together in pathways, leading to sets\nof highly correlated features.

We propose fast\nalgorithms to solve the exclusive group Lasso, and introduce a solution to the\ncase when the underlying group structure is unknown. The solution combines\nstability selection with random group allocation and introduction of artificial\nfeatures.

As an\neffective way to enhance the size and quality of the training data, data\naugmentation is crucial to the successful application of deep learning models\non time series data. In this paper, we systematically review different data\naugmentation methods for time series. We propose a taxonomy for the reviewed\nmethods, and then provide a structured review for these methods by highlighting\ntheir strengths and limitations. We also empirically compare different data\naugmentation methods for different tasks including time series classification,\nanomaly detection, and forecasting. Finally, we discuss and highlight five\nfuture directions to provide useful research guidance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 23:38:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 03:40:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 01:11:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 18:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

Based on\nsimilarities between the attention of reinforcement learning agents and human\ngaze, we propose a novel approach for utilizing gaze data in a computationally\nefficient manner, as part of an auxiliary loss function, which guides a network\nto have higher activations in image regions where the human's gaze fixated.\nThis work is a step towards augmenting any existing convolutional imitation\nlearning agent's training with auxiliary gaze data.

Since BHR 71 is a star-forming core, a significantly subcritical condition\n(i.e., the magnetic field direction deviating from the plane of sky) is\nunlikely, and collapsed from a condition close to a kinematically critical\nstate. There are two possible scenarios to explain the curved magnetic fields\nof BHR 71, one is an hourglass-like field structure due to mass accumulation\nand the other is the Inoue \\& Fukui (2013) mechanism, which proposes the\ninteraction of the core with a shock wave to create curved magnetic fields\nwrapping around the core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 02:12:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

About two decades later,\nsensitive observations made with the Very Large Array revealed the presence of\na mJy double radio source apparently coincident in position with the infrared\nsource n. The radio source was assumed to be the counterpart of the infrared\nsource. However, over the years it has been concluded that the radio source\nshows large proper motions to the south while the infrared source n is\nstationary. Here we reanalyze the proper motions of the radio source adding\nboth older and newer VLA observations than previously used. We confirm the\nproper motions of the radio source that at present no longer coincides\npositionally with the infrared source. The solution to this problem is, most\nprobably, that the infrared source n and the radio source are not the same\nobject: the infrared source is a stationary object in the region while the\nradio counterpart is moving as a result of the explosion that took place in\nthis region some 500 years ago and that expelled large amounts of molecular gas\nas well as several compact sources. Considering the paper where it was first\nreported, we refer to this double radio source as Orion MR.\n  In addition, we use these new observations to fully confirm the large proper\nmotions of the sources IRc23 and Zapata 11. Together with sources BN, I, Orion\nMR, and x, there are at least six compact sources that recede from a point in\ncommon in Orion BN/KL. However, IRc23 is peculiar in that its ejection age\nappears to be only $\\sim$300 years.

For DAG\ntasks, a node represents a request to execute an object on one of the available\nprocessors. In one DAG task, there may be multiple execution requests for one\nobject, each represented by a distinct node. These distinct execution requests\noffer an opportunity to reduce their combined cache overhead through\ncoordinated scheduling of objects as threads within a parallel task. The goal\nof this work is to realize this opportunity by incorporating the cache-aware\nBUNDLE-scheduling algorithm into federated scheduling of sporadic DAG task\nsets.\n  This is the first work to incorporate instruction cache sharing into\nfederated scheduling. The result is a modification of the DAG model named the\nDAG with objects and threads (DAG-OT). Under the DAG-OT model, descriptions of\nnodes explicitly include their underlying executable object and number of\nthreads. When possible, nodes assigned the same executable object are collapsed\ninto a single node; joining their threads when BUNDLE-scheduled. Compared to\nthe DAG model, the DAG-OT model with cache-aware scheduling reduces the number\nof cores allocated to individual tasks by approximately 20 percent in the\nsynthetic evaluation and up to 50 percent on a novel parallel computing\nplatform implementation. By reducing the number of allocated cores, the DAG-OT\nmodel is able to schedule a subset of previously infeasible task sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 02:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-02"}

The relative change is\nmoderately larger in the case of the first two generations of quarks, as they\nhave vanishingly small Yukawa couplings in the SM. The enhancement in the\ncouplings would also lead to a non-negligible contribution from the quark\nfusion process to the production of the 125 GeV Higgs scalar in the SM, though\nthe gluon fusion always dominates.

As an example, we consider a scenario with a SM-gauge-singlet scalar\n$\\phi$ where an $\\mathcal O(1)$ coupling between $\\phi$ and the LQ is allowed.\nThe $\\phi q \\bar{q}$ Yukawa couplings can be generated radiatively only through\na loop of LQ and sterile neutrinos. Here, the quark fusion process can have a\nsignificant cross section, especially for a light $\\phi$. It can even supersede\nthe normally dominant gluon fusion process for a moderate to large value of the\nLQ mass.

Through analyzing this dataset, we discover a neural inheritance\nrelation among the networks with different layer assignments, that is, the\noptimal layer assignments for deeper networks always inherit from those for\nshallow networks. Inspired by this neural inheritance relation, we propose an\nefficient one-shot layer assignment search approach via inherited sampling.\nSpecifically, the optimal layer assignment searched in the shallow network can\nbe provided as a strong sampling priori to train and search the deeper ones in\nsupernet, which extremely reduces the network search space. Comprehensive\nexperiments carried out on CIFAR-100 illustrate the efficiency of our proposed\nmethod. Our search results are strongly consistent with the optimal ones\ndirectly selected from the architecture dataset. To further confirm the\ngeneralization of our proposed method, we also conduct experiments on\nTiny-ImageNet and ImageNet. Our searched results are remarkably superior to the\nhandcrafted ones under the unchanged computational budgets. The neural\ninheritance relation discovered in this paper can provide insights to the\nuniversal neural architecture search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 07:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-02"}

Many practical situations involve\nheterogeneous data where heterogeneity is captured by a nuisance parameter.\nEffectively pooling information across samples while correctly accounting for\nheterogeneity presents a significant challenge in large-scale estimation\nproblems. We address this issue by introducing the ``Nonparametric Empirical\nBayes Structural Tweedie\" (NEST) estimator, which efficiently estimates the\nunknown effect sizes and properly adjusts for heterogeneity via a generalized\nversion of Tweedie's formula. For the normal means problem, NEST simultaneously\nhandles the two main selection biases introduced by heterogeneity: one, the\nselection bias in the mean, which cannot be effectively corrected without also\ncorrecting for, two, selection bias in the variance. We develop theory to show\nthat NEST is asymptotically as good as the optimal Bayes rule that uniquely\nminimizes a weighted squared error loss.

In traditional game theory problems, given a defender and an\nattacker, one searches for mixed strategies which minimize a linear payoff\nfunctional. In the problems addressed in this paper an additional quadratic\nterm is added to the minimization problem. Such term represents switching\ncosts, i.e., the costs for the defender of switching from a given strategy to\nanother one at successive rounds of a Nash game. The resulting problems are\nnonconvex QP ones with linear constraints and turn out to be very challenging.\nWe will show that the most recent approaches for the minimization of nonconvex\nQP functions over polytopes, including commercial solvers such as CPLEX and\nGUROBI, are unable to solve to optimality even test instances with n = 50\nvariables. For this reason, we propose to extend with them the current\nbenchmark set of test instances for QP problems. We also present a spatial\nbranch-and-bound approach for the solution of these problems, where a\npredominant role is played by an optimality-based domain reduction, with\nmultiple solutions of LP problems at each node of the branch-and-bound tree. Of\ncourse, domain reductions are standard tools in spatial branch-and-bound\napproaches. However, our contribution lies in the observation that, from the\ncomputational point of view, a rather aggressive application of these tools\nappears to be the best way to tackle the proposed instances. Indeed, according\nto our experiments, while they make the computational cost per node high, this\nis largely compensated by the rather slow growth of the number of nodes in the\nbranch-and-bound tree, so that the proposed approach strongly outperforms the\nexisting solvers for QP problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 08:51:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 13:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

To demonstrate that `INDICATE' is a powerful spatial analysis tool\nwhich when combined with kinematic data from Gaia DR2 can be used to robustly\nprobe star formation history.\n  Methods. We compared the dynamic & spatial distributions of young stellar\nobjects (YSOs) at various evolutionary stages in NGC 2264 using Gaia DR2 proper\nmotion data and INDICATE.\n  Results. The dynamic & spatial behaviours of YSOs at different evolutionary\nstages are distinct. Dynamically, Class II YSOs predominately have non-random\ntrajectories that are consistent with known substructures, whereas Class III\nYSOs have random trajectories with no clear expansion or contraction patterns.\nSpatially, there is a correlation between the evolutionary stage and source\nconcentration: 69.4% of Class 0/I, 27.9% of Class II, and 7.7% of Class III\nobjects are found to be clustered. The proportion of YSOs clustered with\nobjects of the same class also follows this trend. Class 0/I objects are both\nfound to be more tightly clustered with the general populous/objects of the\nsame class than Class IIs and IIIs by a factor of 1.2/4.1 and 1.9/6.6,\nrespectively. An exception to these findings is within 0.05deg of S Mon where\nClass III objects mimic the behaviours of Class II sources across the wider\ncluster region. Our results suggest (i) current YSOs distributions are a result\nof dynamical evolution, (ii) prolonged star formation has been occurring\nsequentially, and (iii) stellar feedback from S Mon is causing YSOs to appear\nas more evolved sources.\n  Conclusions. Designed to provide a quantitative measure of clustering\nbehaviours, INDICATE is a powerful tool with which to perform rigorous spatial\nanalyses.

The [CII] 158 {\\mu}m far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure line is one\nof the most important cooling lines of the star-forming interstellar medium\n(ISM). High spectral resolution observations have shown complex structures in\nthe line profiles of the [CII] emission. Aims. Our aim is to determine whether\nthe complex profiles observed in [^{12}CII] are due to individual velocity\ncomponents along the line-of-sight or to self-absorption based on a comparison\nof the [^{12}CII] and isotopic [^{13}CII] line profiles. Methods. Deep\nintegrations with the SOFIA/upGREAT 7-pixel array receiver in M43,\nHorsehead~PDR, Monoceros~R2, and M17~SW allow for the detection of optically\nthin [^{13}CII] emission lines, along with the [^{12}CII] emission lines, with\na high signal-to-noise ratio. We first derived the [^{12}CII] optical depth and\nthe [CII] column density from a single component model. However, the complex\nline profiles observed require a double layer model with an emitting background\nand an absorbing foreground. A multi-component velocity fit allows us to derive\nthe physical conditions of the [CII] gas: column density and excitation\ntemperature. Results. We find moderate to high [^{12}CII] optical depths in all\nfour sources and self-absorption of [^{12}CII] in Mon R2 and M17 SW. The high\ncolumn density of the warm background emission corresponds to an equivalent Av\nof up to 41 mag. The foreground absorption requires substantial column\ndensities of cold and dense [CII] gas, with an equivalent Av ranging up to\nabout 13 mag. Conclusions. The column density of the warm background material\nrequires multiple photon-dominated region (PDR) surfaces stacked along the line\nof sight and in velocity. The substantial column density of dense and cold\nforeground [CII] gas detected in absorption cannot be explained with any known\nscenario and we can only speculate on its origins\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 13:06:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

The theoretical modeling of these\nprocesses is challenging, and the only rigorous quantum-dynamics approach that\ncan treat correlated fermions in two and three dimensions is nonequilibrium\nGreen functions (NEGF). However, NEGF simulations are computationally expensive\ndue to their $T^3$-scaling with the simulation duration $T$. Recently,\n$T^2$-scaling was achieved with the generalized Kadanoff--Baym ansatz (GKBA),\nfor the second-order Born (SOA) selfenergy, which has substantially extended\nthe scope of NEGF simulations. In a recent Letter [Schl\\\"unzen \\textit{et al.},\nPhys. Rev.

This allows one to perform the same\nsimulations with order $T^1$-scaling, both for SOA and $GW$ selfenergies giving\nrise to a dramatic speedup. Here we present more details on the G1--G2 scheme,\nincluding derivations of the basic equations including results for a general\nbasis, for Hubbard systems and for jellium.

Finally, we demonstrate that, for\nall selfenergies, the CPU time scaling of the G1--G2 scheme with the basis\ndimension, $N_b$, can be improved compared to our first report: the overhead\ncompared to the original GKBA, is not more than an additional factor $N_b$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 14:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

The starting point is the\nFreidlin-Wentzell theory, which shows how to approximate via a large deviation\nprinciple the invariant distribution of such a diffusion. The rate function of\nthe invariant measure is formulated in terms of quasipotentials, quantities\nthat measure the difficulty of a transition from the neighborhood of one\nmetastable set to another. The theory provides an intuitive and useful\napproximation for the invariant measure, and along the way many useful related\nresults (e.g., transition rates between metastable states) are also developed.\nWith the specific goal of design of Monte Carlo schemes in mind, we prove large\ndeviation limits for integrals with respect to the empirical measure, where the\nprocess is considered over a time interval whose length grows as the noise\ndecreases to zero. In particular, we show how the first and second moments of\nthese integrals can be expressed in terms of quasipotentials.

The higher\nprecision of the localization system may be achieved through the development of\na more sophisticated observation model considering various measurement error\nsources.

The structure of the proposed model allows\nprecomputing and incorporating the measurement error directly into the map\nrepresented by a multichannel digital image.

Noumi and J. Shiraishi by substituting the Pochhammer symbol with a nearly\narbitrary function. Moreover, this generalization is valid for the entire\nShiraishi series, not only for its Noumi-Shiraishi part. The theta function\nneeded in the recently suggested description of the double-elliptic systems, 6d\nN=2* SYM instanton calculus and the doubly-compactified network models, is a\nvery particular member of this huge family. The series depends on two kinds of\nvariables, $\\vec x$ and $\\vec y$, and on a set of parameters, which becomes\ninfinitely large now. Still, one of the parameters, $p$ is distinguished by its\nrole in the series grading. When $\\vec y$ are restricted to a discrete subset\nlabeled by Young diagrams, the series multiplied by a monomial factor reduces\nto a polynomial at any given order in $p$. All this makes the map from\nfunctions to the hypergeometric-like series very promising, and we call it\nShiraishi functor despite it remains to be seen, what are exactly the morphisms\nthat it preserves. Generalized Noumi-Shiraishi (GNS) symmetric polynomials\ninspired by the Shiraishi functor in the leading order in $p$ can be obtained\nby a triangular transform from the Schur polynomials and possess an interesting\ngrading. They provide a family of deformations of Macdonald polynomials, as\nrich as the family of Kerov functions, still very different from them, and, in\nfact, much closer to the Macdonald polynomials. In particular, unlike the Kerov\ncase, these polynomials do not depend on the ordering of Young diagrams in the\ntriangular expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 14:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

When players follow a\nsimple memory-based strategy we observe a spontaneous separation into two\ngroups corresponding to players with relatively high, or low, levels of\ninfection. By modelling the dynamics of both the disease and the formation and\nbreaking of trade relationships, we derive the conditions for which this\nseparation occurs as a function of the transmission rate and the threshold\nlevel of acceptable disease for each player. When interactions in the game are\nrestricted to players that neighbour each other in a small-world network,\nplayers tend to have similar levels of infection as their neighbours.

The absolute electronegativity (\\chi) and\nhardness (\\eta) directly reflect the energy-density relationship via the\nchemical potential dE/dN and we thus hypothesized that they probe universality.\nWe studied \\chi and \\eta for atoms Z = 1-36 using 50 diverse functionals\ncovering all major classes. Very few functionals describe both \\chi and \\eta\nwell. \\eta benefits from error cancelation whereas \\chi is marred by error\npropagation from IP and EA; thus almost all standard GGA and hybrid functionals\ndisplay a plateau in the MAE at 0.2-0.3 eV for \\eta. In contrast, variable\nperformance for \\chi indicates problems in describing the chemical potential by\nDFT. The accuracy and precision of a functional is far from linearly related,\nyet for a universal functional we expect linearity. Popular functionals such as\nB3LYP, PBE, and revPBE, perform poorly for both properties. Density sensitivity\ncalculations indicate large density-derived errors as occupation of degenerate\np- and d-orbitals causes \"non-universality\" and large dependency on exact\nexchange. Thus, we argue that performance for \\chi for the same systems is a\nhallmark of universality by probing dE/dN. With this metric, B98, B97-1,\nPW6B95D3, APFD are the most \"universal\" tested functionals.

They have potential applications in non-linear optics, ferroelectric\ndevices, and quantum devices. Meanwhile, ferroelectric-ferromagnetic (FE-FM)\nmultiferroics display simultaneous ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, leading\nto new technologies in information storage. It remains an open question whether\nmetallicity, ferroelectricity, and ferromagnetism can coexist in a single\ndomain of a material. EuTiO$_3$ is actively studied for potential applications\nin magnetic sensors, memories, magneto-optical devices, and energy conversion\ndevices. It stabilizes at a multi-critical equilibrium and exhibits a rich\nrange of intriguing properties. Here, using the results from hybrid density\nfunctional theory calculations, we report metallic FE-FM multiferroics in\nstrain-engineered epitaxial EuTiO$_3$ with H doping. The emergence of the\nmagnetism in polar metals provides a new degree of freedom to control these\nmaterials in applications. The underlying mechanism for the coexistence of\nmetallicity, ferroelectricity, and ferromagnetism is discussed. The\nferromagnetism in metallic EuTiO$_{3-x}$H$_x$ is explained by the\nRuderman-Kittel-Kasuya- Yosida (RKKY) interaction, which agrees with\nexperiments. The coexistence of metallicity and ferroelectricity is allowed\nbecause the electrons at the Fermi level are weakly coupled to the\nferroelectric distortion.

These real-time systems require effective\nclassification methods that are robust to various sampling resolutions, noisy\nmeasurements, and unconstrained pose configurations. Previous research has\nshown that points' sparsity, rotation and positional inherent variance can lead\nto a significant drop in the performance of point cloud based classification\ntechniques. However, neither of them is sufficiently robust to multifactorial\nvariance and significant sparsity. In this regard, we propose a novel approach\nfor 3D classification that can simultaneously achieve invariance towards\nrotation, positional shift, scaling, and is robust to point sparsity. To this\nend, we introduce a new feature that utilizes graph structure of point clouds,\nwhich can be learned end-to-end with our proposed neural network to acquire a\nrobust latent representation of the 3D object. We show that such latent\nrepresentations can significantly improve the performance of object\nclassification and retrieval tasks when points are sparse.

We test the efficacy of Rosa in removing bias from data-driven\ndecision making systems by performing standard DA tasks on five real-world\ndatasets, selected for their relevance to current DA problems, and also their\nhigh potential for bias. We use simple ML models to model a characteristic of\nanalytical interest, and compare the level of bias in the model output both\nwith and without Rosa as a pre-processing step.

Conventional solutions for fraud detection mainly use some\nrule-based methods or distract some features manually to perform prediction.\nHowever, in financial services, users have rich interactions and they\nthemselves always show multifaceted information. These data form a large\nmultiview network, which is not fully exploited by conventional methods.\nAdditionally, among the network, only very few of the users are labelled, which\nalso poses a great challenge for only utilizing labeled data to achieve a\nsatisfied performance on fraud detection.\n  To address the problem, we expand the labeled data through their social\nrelations to get the unlabeled data and propose a semi-supervised attentive\ngraph neural network, namedSemiGNN to utilize the multi-view labeled and\nunlabeled data for fraud detection. Moreover, we propose a hierarchical\nattention mechanism to better correlate different neighbors and different\nviews. Simultaneously, the attention mechanism can make the model interpretable\nand tell what are the important factors for the fraud and why the users are\npredicted as fraud. Experimentally, we conduct the prediction task on the users\nof Alipay, one of the largest third-party online and offline cashless payment\nplatform serving more than 4 hundreds of million users in China. By utilizing\nthe social relations and the user attributes, our method can achieve a better\naccuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods on two tasks.

Instead, they focus on the\nindividual qualities of the players in isolation. To overcome this limitation\nof their recruitment process, this paper takes a first step towards objectively\nproviding insight into the question: How well does a team of soccer players\ngel? We address that question in both an observational and a predictive\nsetting. In the former setting, we observe the chemistry between players who\nhave actually played together, which is relevant when selecting the best\npossible line-up for a match. In the latter setting, we predict the chemistry\nbetween players who have never played together before, which is particularly\nrelevant to assess the fit of a potential signing with the players who are\nalready on the team.\n  We introduce two chemistry metrics that measure the offensive and defensive\nchemistry for a pair of players, respectively. The offensive chemistry metric\nmeasures the pair's joint performance in terms of scoring goals, whereas the\ndefensive chemistry metric measures their joint performance in preventing their\nopponents from scoring goals. We compute our metrics for 361 seasons in 106\ndifferent competitions and present a number of concrete use cases. For\ninstance, we show that the partnership between Mohamed Salah and Roberto\nFirmino in Liverpool's 2017/2018 Champions League campaign exhibited the\nhighest mutual chemistry between two players.

This\ndata, which measures the movement patterns of people and populations rather\nthan the light they produce, could prove just as valuable in decades to come.\nIn fact, since human mobility is far more directly related to the socioeconomic\nvariables being predicted, it has an even greater potential. Additionally,\nsince cell phone locations can be aggregated in real time while preserving\nindividual user privacy, it will be possible to conduct studies that would\npreviously have been impossible because they require data from the present. Of\ncourse, it will take quite some time to establish the new techniques necessary\nto apply human mobility data to problems traditionally studied with satellite\nimagery and to conceptualize and develop new real time applications. In this\nstudy we demonstrate that it is possible to accelerate this process by\ninferring artificial nighttime satellite imagery from human mobility data,\nwhile maintaining a strong differential privacy guarantee. We also show that\nthese artificial maps can be used to infer socioeconomic variables, often with\ngreater accuracy than using actual satellite imagery. Along the way, we find\nthat the relationship between mobility and light emissions is both nonlinear\nand varies considerably around the globe. Finally, we show that models based on\nhuman mobility can significantly improve our understanding of society at a\nglobal scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 14:25:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

In this work, we develop a pore network model that\nconsiders drainage, evaporation, and rarefied multi-component gas transport in\nporous media with nanoscale pores. Using this model, we investigate the drying\nof a liquid solvent-saturated porous medium enabled by the flow of purge gas\nthrough it. Simulations show that drying progresses in three stages, and the\nsolvent removal by drainage effects (evaporation effects) becomes increasingly\nweak (strong) as drying progresses through these stages. Interestingly,\ndrainage can contribute considerably to solvent removal even after evaporation\neffects become very strong, especially when the applied pressure difference\nacross the porous medium is low. We show that these phenomena are the results\nof the coupling between the drainage and evaporation effects and this coupling\ndepends on the operating conditions and the stage of drying.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 21:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-23"}

Researchers have\nstarted to develop novel methods that allow to manage spillover mechanisms in\nobservational studies; recent works focus primarily on binary treatments.\nHowever, many policy evaluation studies deal with more complex interventions.\nFor instance, in political science, evaluating the impact of policies\nimplemented by administrative entities often implies a multivariate approach,\nas a policy towards a specific issue operates at many different levels and can\nbe defined along a number of dimensions. In this work, we extend the\nstatistical framework about causal inference under network interference in\nobservational studies, allowing for a multi-valued individual treatment and an\ninterference structure shaped by a weighted network. The estimation strategy is\nbased on a joint multiple generalized propensity score and allows one to\nestimate direct effects, controlling for both individual and network\ncovariates. We follow the proposed methodology to analyze the impact of the\nnational immigration policy on the crime rate. We define a multi-valued\ncharacterization of political attitudes towards migrants and we assume that the\nextent to which each country can be influenced by another country is modeled by\nan appropriate indicator, summarizing their cultural and geographical\nproximity. Results suggest that implementing a highly restrictive immigration\npolicy leads to an increase of the crime rate and the estimated effects is\nlarger if we take into account interference from other countries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 11:17:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 08:42:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-25"}
