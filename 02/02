The greatest\nchallenge is of course to achieve large dispersion rates in the\nshort-wavelength x-ray domain. Here we show that crystals in non-coplanar\nasymmetric x-ray Bragg diffraction can function as high-reflectance soft-x-ray\ndiffraction gratings with dispersion rates that are at least two orders of\nmagnitude larger than those that are possible with state-of-the-art man-made\ngratings. This opens new opportunities to design and implement soft x-ray\nresonant inelastic scattering (RIXS) spectrometers with spectral resolutions\nthat are up to two orders of magnitude higher than what is currently possible,\nto further advance a very dynamic field of RIXS spectroscopy, and to make it\ncompetitive with inelastic neutron scattering.

In the present analysis, $A_{ij}$ is factorized into\nits magnitude ($A \\equiv \\sqrt{A_{ij}A_{ij}}$) and normalized tensor $b_{ij}\n\\equiv A_{ij}/A$. The geometric shape is shown to be determined exclusively by\nfour $b_{ij}$ parameters -- second invariant, $q$; third invariant, $r$;\nintermediate strain-rate eigenvalue, $a_2$; and, angle between vorticity and\nintermediate strain-rate eigenvector, $\\omega_2$. Velocity gradient magnitude\n$A$ plays a role only in determining the scale of the local streamline\nstructure. Direct numerical simulation data of forced isotropic turbulence\n($Re_\\lambda \\sim 200 - 600$) is used to establish streamline shape and scale\ndistribution and, then to characterize velocity-gradient dynamics.

Apart from the technical problems in organising feedback quantum\ncontrol in real time, the difficulty in applying this theory for obtaining\nmathematically amenable control systems is due partially to the fact that it\nleads usually to rather nontrivial jump-type Markov processes and/or degenerate\ndiffusions on manifolds, for which the corresponding control is very difficult\nto handle.

However, the inherent\nuncertainty of wind energy raises operational challenges. To ensure the\ncost-efficient, reliable and robust operation, it is critically important to\nfind the optimal decision that can correctly and rigorously hedge against all\nsources of uncertainty. In this paper, we propose data-driven stochastic unit\ncommitment (SUC) to guide the power grids scheduling. Specifically, given the\nfinite historical data, the posterior predictive distribution is developed to\nquantify the wind power prediction uncertainty accounting for both inherent\nstochastic uncertainty of wind power generation and input model estimation\nerror. For complex power grid systems, a finite number of scenarios is used to\nestimate the expected cost in the planning horizon. To further control the\nimpact of finite sampling error induced by using the sample average\napproximation (SAA), we propose a parallel computing based optimization\nsolution methodology, which can quickly find the reliable optimal unit\ncommitment decision hedging against various sources of uncertainty. The\nempirical study over six-bus and 118-bus systems demonstrates that our approach\ncan provide more efficient and robust performance than the existing\ndeterministic and stochastic unit commitment approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2020 20:51:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 05:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

Given the coarse-grained modeling in theories of fluids, considerable\nuncertainties may exist between the flow-field solutions and the real physics.\nTo study the emergence, propagation and evolution of uncertainties from\nmolecular to hydrodynamic level poses great opportunities and challenges to\ndevelop both sound theories and reliable multi-scale numerical algorithms. In\nthis paper, a new stochastic kinetic scheme will be developed that includes\nuncertainties via a hybridization of stochastic Galerkin and collocation\nmethods. Based on the Boltzmann-BGK model equation, a scale-dependent evolving\nsolution is employed in the scheme to construct governing equations in the\ndiscretized temporal-spatial domain. Therefore typical flow physics can be\nrecovered with respect to different physical characteristic scales and\nnumerical resolutions in a self-adaptive manner. We prove that the scheme is\nformally asymptotic-preserving in different flow regimes with the inclusion of\nrandom variables, so that it can be used for the study of multi-scale\nnon-equilibrium gas dynamics under the effect of uncertainties.\n  Several numerical experiments are shown to validate the scheme. We make new\nphysical observations, such as the wave-propagation patterns of uncertainties\nfrom continuum to rarefied regimes. These phenomena will be presented and\nanalyzed quantitatively. The current method provides a novel tool to quantify\nthe uncertainties within multi-scale flow evolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2020 21:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

In this paper,\nthe performance of cellular-connected UAV-UEs is studied under 3D practical\nantenna configurations. Two scenarios are studied: scenarios with static,\nhovering UAV- UEs and scenarios with mobile UAV-UEs. For both scenarios, the\nUAV-UE coverage probability is characterized as a function of the system\nparameters. The effects of the number of antenna elements on the UAV-UE\ncoverage probability and handover rate of mobile UAV-UEs are then investigated.\nResults reveal that the UAV-UE coverage probability under a practical antenna\npattern is worse than that under a simple antenna model. Moreover,\nvertically-mobile UAV-UEs are susceptible to altitude handover due to\nconsecutive crossings of the nulls and peaks of the antenna side-lobes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2020 00:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

Active depth sensors are\nappealing because they obtain dense and accurate depth maps. However, due to\nissues that range from power constraints to multi-sensor interference, these\nsensors cannot always be continuously used. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose an algorithm that estimates depth maps using concurrently collected\nimages and a previously measured depth map for dynamic scenes, where both the\ncamera and objects in the scene may be independently moving. To estimate depth\nin these scenarios, our algorithm models the dynamic scene motion using\nindependent and rigid motions. It then uses the previous depth map to\nefficiently estimate these rigid motions and obtain a new depth map. Our goal\nis to balance the acquisition of depth between the active depth sensor and\ncomputation, without incurring a large computational cost. Thus, we leverage\nthe prior depth information to avoid computationally expensive operations like\ndense optical flow estimation or segmentation used in similar approaches.

In this paper,\nto address this multi-agent GAN problem, a novel brainstorming GAN (BGAN)\narchitecture is proposed using which multiple agents can generate real-like\ndata samples while operating in a fully distributed manner and preserving their\ndata privacy. BGAN allows the agents to gain information from other agents\nwithout sharing their real datasets but by \"brainstorming\" via the sharing of\ntheir generated data samples. In contrast to existing distributed GAN\nsolutions, the proposed BGAN architecture is designed to be fully distributed,\nand it does not need any centralized controller. Moreover, BGANs are shown to\nbe scalable and not dependent on the hyperparameters of the agents' deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) thus enabling the agents to have different DNN architectures.\nTheoretically, the interactions between BGAN agents are analyzed as a game\nwhose unique Nash equilibrium is derived. Experimental results show that BGAN\ncan generate real-like data samples with higher quality and lower\nJensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and Fr\\'echet Inception distance (FID) compared\nto other distributed GAN architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2020 02:58:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 02:49:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-18"}

Different from the previous studies on IRS that merely focused on\ntuning the reflection coefficient of all the reflection elements at IRS, in\nthis paper, we consider the true reflection resource management. Specifically,\nthe true reflection resource management can be realized via trigger module\nselection based on our proposed IRS architecture that all the reflection\nelements are partially controlled by multiple parallel switches of controller.\nAs the number of reflection elements increases, the true reflection resource\nmanagement will become urgently needed in this context, which is due to the\nnon-ignorable energy consumption. Moreover, the proposed modular architecture\nof IRS is designed to make the reflection elements part independent and\ncontrollable. As such, our goal is to maximize the minimum\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at DTs via a joint trigger\nmodule subset selection, transmit power allocation of STs, and the\ncorresponding passive beamforming of the trigger modules, subject to per ST\npower budgets and module size constraint. Whereas this problem is NP-hard due\nto the module size constraint, to deal with it, we transform the hard module\nsize constraint into the group sparse constraint by introducing the mixed row\nblock norm, which yields a suitable semidefinite relaxation. Additionally, the\nparallel alternating direction method of multipliers (PADMM) is proposed to\nidentify the trigger module subset, and then subsequently the transmit power\nallocation and passive beamforming can be obtained by solving the original\nminimum SINR maximization problem without the group sparse constraint via\npartial linearization for generalized fractional programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2020 05:15:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 17:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

Model\naveraging is a promising approach for achieving the good generalization\ncapability of DNNs, especially when the loss surface for training contains many\nsharp minima. We present a new quantized neural network optimization approach,\nstochastic quantized weight averaging (SQWA), to design low-precision DNNs with\ngood generalization capability using model averaging. The proposed approach\nincludes (1) floating-point model training, (2) direct quantization of weights,\n(3) capturing multiple low-precision models during retraining with cyclical\nlearning rates, (4) averaging the captured models, and (5) re-quantizing the\naveraged model and fine-tuning it with low-learning rates. Additionally, we\npresent a loss-visualization technique on the quantized weight domain to\nclearly elucidate the behavior of the proposed method. Visualization results\nindicate that a quantized DNN (QDNN) optimized with the proposed approach is\nlocated near the center of the flat minimum in the loss surface. With SQWA\ntraining, we achieved state-of-the-art results for 2-bit QDNNs on CIFAR-100 and\nImageNet datasets.

Bravyi et al.

(2002), has $O(L^2)$ time\ncomplexity. Here, we present an optimal local unitary encoding circuit for the\nplanar surface code that uses exactly $2L$ time steps to encode an unknown\nstate in a distance $L$ planar code. We further show how an $O(L)$ complexity\nlocal unitary encoder for the toric code can be found by enforcing locality in\nthe $O(\\log L)$-depth non-local renormalisation encoder. We relate these\ntechniques by providing an $O(L)$ local unitary circuit to convert between a\ntoric code and a planar code, and also provide optimal encoders for the\nrectangular, rotated and 3D surface codes. Furthermore, we show how our\nencoding circuit for the planar code can be used to prepare fermionic states in\nthe compact mapping, a recently introduced fermion to qubit mapping that has a\nstabiliser structure similar to that of the surface code and is particularly\nefficient for simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2020 11:09:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 17:12:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 21:05:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 22:34:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 16:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

In stead of certain\nhypotheses on the leader system, a group of geometric conditions is put forward\nto develop a novel distributed observer strategy with less conservatism,\nthereby definitely improving the applicability of the existing results. To be\nmore specific, the improved distributed observer can precisely handle consensus\nproblems for some nonlinear leader systems which are invalid for the\ntraditional strategies with the certain assumption, such as Elastic Shaft\nSingle Linkage Manipulator (ESSLM) systems and most of first-order nonlinear\nsystems.

Then, a partial feedback linearization method with\nzero dynamic proposed in differential geometry is employed to design a purely\ndecentralized control law for the affine nonlinear multi-agent system. With\nthis advancement, the existing results can be regarded as a specific case owing\nto that the followers can be chosen as an arbitrary minimum phase affine smooth\nnonlinear system.

The dispersion relation of MHD waves is derived in the\nframework of both standard and Hall-MHD and is numerically solved with input\nparameters: the density contrast $\\eta = \\rho_\\mathrm{e}/\\rho_\\mathrm{i}$, the\nmagnetic fields ratio $b = {B}_\\mathrm{e}/{B}_\\mathrm{i}$, and the Hall scale\nparameter $l_\\mathrm{Hall}/a$. It is found that the Hall current, at moderate\nvalues of $l_\\mathrm{Hall}/a$, stimulates the emerging of KHI of the kink ($m =\n1)$ and high-mode ($m \\geqslant 2$) MHD waves, while for the sausage wave ($m =\n0$) the trend is just the opposite---the KHI is suppressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2020 12:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

We demonstrate that a relatively flat PEL is\nnot only necessary but also sufficient for the formation of a nanoscale glass.\nWe show that: (1) as long as a nanocluster is located in a region of PEL with\nlocal minimum deep enough, it can undergo a first-order solid-liquid phase\ntransition; and (2) if a nanocluster is located in a relatively flat PEL, it\ncan undergo a glass transition.

Challenges concentrate on capturing pedestrians' motion\npatterns and social interactions, as well as handling the future uncertainties.\nRecent studies focus on modeling pedestrians' motion patterns with recurrent\nneural networks, capturing social interactions with pooling-based or\ngraph-based methods, and handling future uncertainties by using random Gaussian\nnoise as the latent variable. However, they do not integrate specific obstacle\navoidance experience (OAE) that may improve prediction performance. For\nexample, pedestrians' future trajectories are always influenced by others in\nfront. Here we propose GTPPO (Graph-based Trajectory Predictor with Pseudo\nOracle), an encoder-decoder-based method conditioned on pedestrians' future\nbehaviors. Pedestrians' motion patterns are encoded with a long short-term\nmemory unit, which introduces the temporal attention to highlight specific time\nsteps. Their interactions are captured by a graph-based attention mechanism,\nwhich draws OAE into the data-driven learning process of graph attention.\nFuture uncertainties are handled by generating multi-modal outputs with an\ninformative latent variable. Such a variable is generated by a novel pseudo\noracle predictor, which minimizes the knowledge gap between historical and\nground-truth trajectories. Finally, the GTPPO is evaluated on ETH, UCY and\nStanford Drone datasets, and the results demonstrate state-of-the-art\nperformance. Besides, the qualitative evaluations show successful cases of\nhandling sudden motion changes in the future. Such findings indicate that GTPPO\ncan peek into the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2020 13:40:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 07:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-21"}

WaveTTS\nensures both the quality of the acoustic features and the resulting speech\nwaveform.

It builds upon the\nrecently introduced xDNN method addressing more complex multi-class problems,\nspecifically when classes are highly imbalanced. DMR moves away from a direct\ndecision based on all classes towards a layered DT of pair-wise class\ncomparisons. In addition, it forces the prototypes to be balanced between\nclasses regardless of possible class imbalances of the training data. It has\ntwo novel mechanisms, namely i) using a DT to determine the winning class\nlabel, and ii) balancing the classes by synthesizing data around the prototypes\ndetermined from the available training data. As a result, we improved\nsignificantly the performance of the resulting fully explainable DNN as\nevidenced by the best reported result on the well know benchmark problem\nCaltech-101 surpassing our own recently published \"world record\". Furthermore,\nwe also achieved another \"world record\" for another very hard benchmark\nproblem, namely Caltech-256 as well as surpassed the results of other\napproaches on Faces-1999 problem. In summary, we propose a new approach\nspecifically advantageous for imbalanced multi-class problems that achieved two\nworld records on well known hard benchmark problems and the best result on\nanother problem in terms of accuracy. Moreover, DMR offers full explainability,\ndoes not require GPUs and can continue to learn from new data by adding new\nprototypes preserving the previous ones but not requiring full retraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2020 14:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

The mitotic cell count is one of the most common tests\nto assess the aggressiveness or grade of breast cancer. In this prognosis,\nhistopathology images must be examined by a pathologist using high-resolution\nmicroscopes to count the cells. Unfortunately, this can be an exhaustive task\nwith poor reproducibility, especially for non-experts. Deep learning networks\nhave recently been adapted to medical applications which are able to\nautomatically localize these regions of interest. However, these region-based\nnetworks lack the ability to take advantage of the segmentation features\nproduced by a full image CNN which are often used as a sole method of\ndetection. Therefore, the proposed method leverages Faster RCNN for object\ndetection while fusing segmentation features generated by a UNet with RGB image\nfeatures to achieve an F-score of 0.508 on the MITOS-ATYPIA 2014 mitosis\ncounting challenge dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2020 20:20:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2022 00:06:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-18"}

Manned aerial surveys are an essential element of the planned\nconsequence management operation, as demonstrated by the recovery work\nfollowing the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, and their effects in\nFukushima, Japan. Flying lower and slower than manned aircraft, an unmanned\naerial vehicle (UAV) can provide improved spatial resolution. In particular,\nhot spot activity can be underestimated in manned survey results as the higher\nflight altitude and wider line spacing effectively average the hot spot over a\nlarger area. Moreover, a UAV can enter an area which is hazardous for humans.\nNRCan has been investigating the inclusion of UAV-borne radiation survey\nspectrometers into its aerial survey response procedures. The Advanced\nRadiation Detector for UAV Operations (ARDUO) was developed to exploit the\nflight and lift capabilities available in the under 25kg class of UAVs. The\ndetector features eight 2.8cm x 2.8cm x 5.6cm CsI(Tl) crystals in a\nself-shielding configuration, read out with silicon photomultipliers and\ndigitized using miniaturized custom electronics. The ARDUO is flown on a main-\nand tail-rotor UAV called Responder which has a 6kg lift capacity and up to\n40min. endurance. The performance of the ARDUO-Responder UAV system was\ncharacterized in both lab and outdoor trials. Outdoor trials consisted of\naerial surveys over sealed point sources and over a distributed source. Results\nshow how the directional response of the ARDUO can provide an indication in\nreal time of source location for in-flight guidance. As well, the results show\nhow use of the directional information in post-acquisition processing can\nresult in improved spatial resolution of radiation features for both point and\ndistributed sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2020 22:51:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-13"}
