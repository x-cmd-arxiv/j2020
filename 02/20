We introduce a technique,\nthat we call {\\sl semigroup-fication}, which allows to construct a continuous\nsemigroup $(\\phi_t)$ of holomorphic self-maps of the unit disc whose time one\nmap $\\phi_1$ is, in a sense, very close to $f$. The semigrup-fication of $f$ is\nof the same type as $f$ (elliptic, hyperbolic, parabolic of positive step or\nparabolic of zero step) and there is a one-to-one correspondence between the\nset of boundary regular fixed points of $f$ with a given multiplier and the\ncorresponding set for $\\phi_1$. Moreover, in case $f$ (and hence $\\phi_1$) has\nno interior fixed points, the slope of the orbits converging to the\nDenjoy-Wolff point is the same. The construction is based on holomorphic\nmodels, localization techniques and Gromov hyperbolicity. As an application of\nthis construction, we prove that in the non-elliptic case, the orbits of $f$\nconverge non-tangentially to the Denjoy-Wolff point if and only if the Koenigs\ndomain of $f$ is \"almost symmetric\" with respect to vertical lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 16:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

This bound has no direct dependence on the number of weights\nand compares favourably to other bounds when applied to convolutional networks.\nOur bound is highly relevant for fine-tuning, because providing a network with\na good initialisation based on transfer learning means that learning can modify\nthe weights less, and hence achieve tighter generalisation. Inspired by this,\nwe develop a simple yet effective fine-tuning algorithm that constrains the\nhypothesis class to a small sphere centred on the initial pre-trained weights,\nthus obtaining provably better generalisation performance than conventional\ntransfer learning. Empirical evaluation shows that our algorithm works well,\ncorroborating our theoretical results.

The spatial power spectrum of supergranulation does not fully\ncharacterize the underlying physics of turbulent convection. For example, it\ndoes not describe the non-Gaussianity in the horizontal flow divergence.\n  Aims. Our aim is to statistically characterize the spatial pattern of solar\nsupergranulation beyond the power spectrum. The next-order statistic is the\nbispectrum. It measures correlations of three Fourier components and is related\nto the nonlinearities in the underlying physics.\n  Methods. We estimated the bispectrum of supergranular horizontal surface\ndivergence maps that were obtained using local correlation tracking (LCT) and\ntime-distance helioseismology (TD) from one year of data from the Helioseismic\nand Magnetic Imager on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory starting in May\n2010.\n  Results. We find significantly nonzero and consistent estimates for the\nbispectrum. The strongest nonlinearity is present when the three coupling wave\nvectors are at the supergranular scale. These are the same wave vectors that\nare present in regular hexagons, which were used in analytical studies of solar\nconvection. At these Fourier components, the bispectrum is positive, consistent\nwith the positive skewness in the data and with supergranules preferentially\nconsisting of outflows surrounded by a network of inflows. We use the\nbispectrum to generate synthetic divergence maps that are very similar to the\ndata by a model that consists of a Gaussian term and a weaker quadratic\nnonlinear component. Thereby, we estimate the fraction of the variance in the\ndivergence maps from the nonlinear component to be of the order of 4-6%.\n  Conclusions. We propose that bispectral analysis is useful for understanding\nsolar turbulent convection, for example for comparing observations and\nnumerical models of supergranular flows.

This increase is often attributed to the \"accumulation of\ndamage\" known to occur in many biological structures and systems. The aim of\nthis paper is to describe a generic model of damage accumulation and death in\nwhich mortality increases exponentially with age. The damage-accumulation\nprocess is modeled by a stochastic process know as a queue, and risk of dying\nis a function of the accumulated damage, i.e. length of the queue. The model\nhas four parameters and the main characteristics of the model are: (i) damage\noccurs at random times with a constant high rate; (ii) the damage is repaired\nat a limited rate, and consequently damage can accumulate; (iii) the efficiency\nof the repair mechanism decays linearly with age; (iv) the risk of dying is a\nfunction of the accumulated damage. Using standard results from the\nmathematical theory of queues it is shown that there is an exponential\ndependence between risk of dying and age in these models, and that this\ndependency holds irrespective of how the damage-accumulation process is\nmodeled. Furthermore, the ways in which this exponential dependence is shaped\nby the model parameters are also independent of the details of the damage\naccumulation process. These generic features suggest that the model could be\nuseful when interpreting changes in the relation between age and mortality in\nreal data. To examplify, historical mortality data from Sweden are interpreted\nin the light of the model. The decrease in mortality seen between cohorts born\nin 1905, compared to those born in 1885, can be accounted for by higher\nthreshold to damage. This fits well with the many advances made in public\nhealth during the 20th century.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 17:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

The objective of the restoration problem is to\nresupply the maximum energy of loads considering their priorities using minimum\nswitching operations. Basically, it is desired to provide a unique\nconfiguration that is valid regarding the load and generation profiles along\nthe entire restorative period. However, this unique configuration may not\nsatisfy at the same time: I) the DG start-up requirements at the beginning of\nthe restoration plan and II) the topological conditions that would allow the DG\nto provide later on the most efficient support for the supply of loads.\nTherefore, it is proposed in this paper to allow a limited number of\nreconfiguration steps according to the DG start-up requirements. In addition,\nthis paper presents a novel formulation for the reconfiguration problem that\naccounts for partial restoration scenarios where the whole unsupplied area\ncannot be restored. The decision variables of the proposed multi-step\nrestoration problem are: I) the line switching actions at each step of the\nreconfiguration process, II) the load switching actions during the whole\nrestorative period and, III) the active/reactive power dispatch of DGs during\nthe whole restorative period. A relaxed AC power flow formulation is integrated\nto the optimization problem in order to ensure the feasibility of the solution\nconcerning the operational safety constraints. The overall model is formulated\nin terms of a mixed-integer second-order cone programming. Two simulation\nscenarios are studied in order to illustrate different features of the proposed\nstrategy and to demonstrate its effectiveness particularly in the case of\nlarge-scale outages in distribution networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 17:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-26"}

We explore weight pruning for BERT and ask: how does\ncompression during pre-training affect transfer learning? We find that pruning\naffects transfer learning in three broad regimes. Low levels of pruning\n(30-40%) do not affect pre-training loss or transfer to downstream tasks at\nall. Medium levels of pruning increase the pre-training loss and prevent useful\npre-training information from being transferred to downstream tasks. High\nlevels of pruning additionally prevent models from fitting downstream datasets,\nleading to further degradation. Finally, we observe that fine-tuning BERT on a\nspecific task does not improve its prunability. We conclude that BERT can be\npruned once during pre-training rather than separately for each task without\naffecting performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 17:40:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 21:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

The major impediment to fast training is the quadratic\ngrowth of both memory and compute requirements of dense and convolutional\nlayers with respect to their information bandwidth. Recently, training `a\npriori' sparse networks has been proposed as a method for allowing layers to\nretain high information bandwidth, while keeping memory and compute low.\nHowever, the choice of which sparse topology should be used in these networks\nis unclear. In this work, we provide a theoretical foundation for the choice of\nintra-layer topology. First, we derive a new sparse neural network\ninitialization scheme that allows us to explore the space of very deep sparse\nnetworks. Next, we evaluate several topologies and show that seemingly similar\ntopologies can often have a large difference in attainable accuracy. To explain\nthese differences, we develop a data-free heuristic that can evaluate a\ntopology independently from the dataset the network will be trained on. We then\nderive a set of requirements that make a good topology, and arrive at a single\ntopology that satisfies all of them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 18:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

Systems such as this\none are not predicted by the core accretion theory of planet formation. Here we\nsuggest a novel mechanism, in which the giant planet is born around a more\ntypical Sun-like star ($M_{*,1}$), but is subsequently exchanged during a\ndynamical interaction with a flyby low-mass star ($M_{*,2}$). We perform\nstate-of-the-art $N$-body simulations with $M_{*,1}=1M_\\odot$ and\n$M_{*,2}=0.1M_\\odot$ to study the statistical outcomes of this interaction, and\nshow that exchanges result in high eccentricities for the new orbit around the\nlow-mass star, while about half of the outcomes result in tighter orbits than\nthe planet had around its birth star.

These images were analysed and\ninterpreted using general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) models of\naccretion disks with rotation axes aligned with the black hole spin axis.\nHowever, since infalling gas is often insensitive to the black hole spin\ndirection, misalignment between accretion disk and black hole spin may be a\ncommon occurrence in nature.

The emergence of complex SPM engines brings forth\nthe challenge of reliable data interpretation, i.e. conversion from detected\nsignal to descriptors specific to tip-surface interactions and subsequently to\nmaterials properties. Here, we implemented a Bayesian inference approach for\nthe analysis of the image formation mechanisms in band excitation (BE) SPM.\nCompared to the point estimates in classical functional fit approaches,\nBayesian inference allows for the incorporation of extant knowledge of\nmaterials and probe behavior in the form of corresponding prior distribution\nand return the information on the material functionality in the form of readily\ninterpretable posterior distributions. We note that in application of Bayesian\nmethods, special care should be made for proper setting on the problem as model\nselection vs. establishing practical parameter equivalence. We further explore\nthe non-linear mechanical behaviors at topological defects in a classical\nferroelectric material, PbTiO3. We observe the non-trivial evolution of Duffing\nresonance frequency and the nonlinearity of the sample surface, suggesting the\npresence of the hidden elements of domain structure.

In 'soft' X-ray states\nthe jets are suppressed, but the current picture lacks an understanding of the\nX-ray features associated with the quenching or recovering of these jets. Here\nwe show that a brief, ~4 day infrared (IR) brightening during a predominantly\nsoft X-ray state of the BHXB 4U 1543-47 is contemporaneous with a strong X-ray\nType B quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO), a slight spectral hardening and an\nincrease in the rms variability, indicating an excursion to the\nsoft-intermediate state (SIMS). This IR 'flare' has a spectral index consistent\nwith optically thin synchrotron emission and most likely originates from the\nsteady, compact jet. This core jet emitting in the IR is usually only\nassociated with the hard state, and its appearance during the SIMS places the\n'jet line' between the SIMS and the soft state in the hardness-intensity\ndiagram for this source. IR emission is produced in a small region of the jets\nclose to where they are launched (~ 0.1 light-seconds), and the timescale of\nthe IR flare in 4U 1543-47 is far too long to be caused by a single, discrete\nejection.

As such, it is widely used in\napplications in density estimation, belief propagation, and Bayesian filtering.\nIn these applications, a finite Gaussian mixture provides an initial\napproximation to density functions that are updated recursively. A challenge in\nthese recursions is that the order of the Gaussian mixture increases\nexponentially, and the inference quickly becomes intractable. To overcome the\ndifficulty, the Gaussian mixture reduction, which approximates a high order\nGaussian mixture by one with a lower order, can be used.

This reduces data privacy risks, however, privacy\nconcerns still exist since it is possible to leak information about the\ntraining dataset from the trained model's weights or parameters. Setting up a\nfederated learning environment, especially with security and privacy\nguarantees, is a time-consuming process with numerous configurations and\nparameters that can be manipulated. In order to help clients ensure that\ncollaboration is feasible and to check that it improves their model accuracy, a\nreal-world simulator for privacy-preserving and secure federated learning is\nrequired. In this paper, we introduce PrivacyFL, which is an extensible, easily\nconfigurable and scalable simulator for federated learning environments.

Furthermore, this paper\nalso presents that both the users' preferences and the special characteristic\nof data distribution can trigger the small-probability event scenarios where\nonly a fraction of data can cover the vast majority of users' interests.\nWhether it is for one of the reasons above, the data with highly clustered\nmessage importance is beneficial to compression storage. In contrast, the data\nwith uniform information distribution is incompressible, which is consistent\nwith that in information theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 03:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Although orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM) remains as the waveform of the upcoming fifth-generation\n(5G) standard, the new radio provides flexibility in waveform parametrization\n(a.k.a. numerology) to address diverse requirements. However, managing the\npeaceful coexistence of mixed numerologies is challenging due to\ninter-numerology interference (INI). This paper proposes the utilization of\nadaptive guards in both time and frequency domains as a solution along with a\nmulti-window operation in the physical (PHY) layer. The adaptive windowing\noperation needs a guard duration to reduce the unwanted emissions, and a guard\nband is required to handle the INI level on the adjacent band. The guards in\nboth domains are jointly optimized with respect to the subcarrier spacing, use\ncase (i.e., service requirement), and power offset between the numerologies.\nAlso, the multi-window approach provides managing each side of the spectrum\nindependently in case of an asymmetric interference scenario. Since the allowed\ninterference level depends on the numerologies operating in the adjacent bands,\nthe potential of adaptive guards is further increased and exploited with a\nmedium access control (MAC) layer scheduling technique. The proposed INI-based\nscheduling algorithm decreases the need for guards by allocating the\nnumerologies to the available bands, considering their subcarrier spacing,\npower level, and SIR requirements. Therefore, INI management is performed with\na cross-layer (PHY and MAC) approach in this study. The results show that the\nprecise design that accommodates such flexibility reduces the guards\nsignificantly and improves the spectral efficiency of mixed numerology systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 21:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-21"}

To encourage volunteers to complete\na task, platforms use nudging mechanisms to notify a subset of volunteers with\nthe hope that at least one of them responds positively. However, since\nexcessive notifications may reduce volunteer engagement, the platform faces a\ntrade-off between notifying more volunteers for the current task and saving\nthem for future ones. Motivated by these applications, we introduce the online\nvolunteer notification problem, a generalization of online stochastic bipartite\nmatching where tasks arrive following a known time-varying distribution over\ntask types. Upon arrival of a task, the platform notifies a subset of\nvolunteers with the objective of minimizing the number of missed tasks. To\ncapture each volunteer's adverse reaction to excessive notifications, we assume\nthat a notification triggers a random period of inactivity, during which she\nwill ignore all notifications. However, if a volunteer is active and notified,\nshe will perform the task with a given pair-specific match probability that\ncaptures her preference for the task. We develop an online randomized policy\nthat achieves a constant-factor guarantee close to the upper bound we establish\nfor the performance of any online policy. Our policy as well as hardness\nresults are parameterized by the minimum discrete hazard rate of the\ninter-activity time distribution. The design of our policy relies on\nsparsifying an ex-ante feasible solution by solving a sequence of dynamic\nprograms. Further, in collaboration with Food Rescue U.S., a volunteer-based\nfood recovery platform, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our policy by\ntesting them on the platform's data from various locations across the U.S.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 22:16:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 00:40:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 03:16:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 17:38:27 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 20:16:10 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 17:39:25 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 18:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-02"}

Recent work shows that many\nreal-world graphs have small hyperbolicity $\\delta$. This paper describes the\neccentricity terrain of a $\\delta$-hyperbolic graph. The eccentricity function\n$e_G(v)=\\max\\{d(v,u) : u \\in V\\}$ partitions the vertex set of $G$ into\neccentricity layers $C_{k}(G) = \\{v \\in V : e(v)=rad(G)+k\\}$, $k \\in\n\\mathbb{N}$, where $rad(G)=\\min\\{e_G(v): v\\in V\\}$ is the radius of $G$.

It introduces the notion of $\\beta$-pseudoconvexity, which implies\nGromov's $\\epsilon$-quasiconvexity, and illustrates the abundance of\npseudoconvex sets in $\\delta$-hyperbolic graphs.

It is well known that solvent evaporation in polymer solutions\ncan lead to Rayleigh-B\\'enard or Marangoni-type instabilities. Here we reveal\nanother mechanism, namely that evaporation can cause the interface to display\nRayleigh-Taylor instabilities due to the build-up of a dense layer at the\nair-liquid interface. We study experimentally the onset time ($t_p$) of the\ninstability as a function of the macroscopic properties of aqueous polymer\nsolutions, which we tune by varying the polymer concentration ($c_0$),\nmolecular weight and polymer type. In dilute solutions, $t_p$ shows two\nlimiting behaviors depending on the polymer diffusivity. For high diffusivity\npolymers (low molecular weight), the pluming time scales as $c_0^{-2/3}$. This\nresult agrees with previous studies on gravitational instabilities in miscible\nsystems where diffusion stabilizes the system. On the other hand, in low\ndiffusivity polymers the pluming time scales as $c_0^{-1}$. The stabilizing\neffect of an effective interfacial tension, similar to those in immiscible\nsystems, explains this strong concentration dependence. Above a critical\nconcentration, $\\hat{c}$, viscosity delays the growth of the instability,\nallowing time for diffusion to act as the dominant stabilizing mechanism.

The\nline ratios indicate that both C$^{18}$O and C$^{17}$O lines are optically\nthick in the disk region, and only $^{13}$C$^{18}$O line is optically thin. The\nline profiles of the $^{13}$C$^{18}$O emissions are best reproduced by\nKeplerian gaseous disks at similar sizes as their mm-continuum emissions,\nsuggesting small radial separations between the gas and mm-sized grains in\nthese disks, in contrast to the large separation commonly seen in\nprotoplanetary disks. Assuming a gas-to-dust ratio of 100, we find that the CO\ngas abundances in these protostellar disks are consistent with the ISM\nabundance within a factor of 2, nearly one order of magnitude higher than the\naverage value of 1-10 Myr old disks. These results suggest that there is a\nfast, $\\sim$1 Myr, evolution of the abundance of CO gas from the protostellar\ndisk stage to the protoplanetary disk stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 01:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

Here we report the first direct evidence of an elevated C/H ratio\nin disk gas. We use two thermo-chemical codes to model the $^{13}$C$^{18}$O,\nC$^{17}$O, and C$^{18}$O (2-1) line spectra of the HD 163296 disk.

Quantifying quality and uncertainty\nof a selection result via false discovery rate (FDR) control has been of recent\ninterest. This paper introduces a way of using data-splitting strategies to\nasymptotically control the FDR while maintaining a high power. For each\nfeature, the method constructs a test statistic by estimating two independent\nregression coefficients via data splitting. FDR control is achieved by taking\nadvantage of the statistic's property that, for any null feature, its sampling\ndistribution is symmetric about zero. Furthermore, we propose Multiple Data\nSplitting (MDS) to stabilize the selection result and boost the power.\nInterestingly and surprisingly, with the FDR still under control, MDS not only\nhelps overcome the power loss caused by sample splitting, but also results in a\nlower variance of the false discovery proportion (FDP) compared with all other\nmethods in consideration. We prove that the proposed data-splitting methods can\nasymptotically control the FDR at any designated level for linear and Gaussian\ngraphical models in both low and high dimensions. Through intensive simulation\nstudies and a real-data application, we show that the proposed methods are\nrobust to the unknown distribution of features, easy to implement and\ncomputationally efficient, and are often the most powerful ones amongst\ncompetitors especially when the signals are weak and the correlations or\npartial correlations are high among features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 02:43:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 03:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

This strategy seeks to overcome the\ncomputational challenges associated with optimal control problems that span\nmultiple timescales. The coarsening approach uses a time discretization grid\nthat becomes exponentially more sparse as one moves forward in time. This\ndesign is motivated by a recently established property of optimal control\nproblems that is known as exponential decay of sensitivity. This property\nstates that the impact of a parametric perturbation at a future time decays\nexponentially as one moves backward in time. We establish conditions under\nwhich this property holds for a constrained MPC formulation with linear\ndynamics and costs.

However, operating such high capacity MEC hosts can\nsignificantly increase energy consumption. Thus, a base station (BS) unit can\nact as a self-powered BS. In this paper, an effective energy dispatch mechanism\nfor self-powered wireless networks with edge computing capabilities is studied.\nFirst, a two-stage linear stochastic programming problem is formulated with the\ngoal of minimizing the total energy consumption cost of the system while\nfulfilling the energy demand. Second, a semi-distributed data-driven solution\nis proposed by developing a novel multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning\n(MAMRL) framework to solve the formulated problem. In particular, each BS plays\nthe role of a local agent that explores a Markovian behavior for both energy\nconsumption and generation while each BS transfers time-varying features to a\nmeta-agent. Sequentially, the meta-agent optimizes (i.e., exploits) the energy\ndispatch decision by accepting only the observations from each local agent with\nits own state information. Meanwhile, each BS agent estimates its own energy\ndispatch policy by applying the learned parameters from meta-agent. Finally,\nthe proposed MAMRL framework is benchmarked by analyzing deterministic,\nasymmetric, and stochastic environments in terms of non-renewable energy\nusages, energy cost, and accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed\nMAMRL model can reduce up to 11% non-renewable energy usage and by 22.4% the\nenergy cost (with 95.8% prediction accuracy), compared to other baseline\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 04:58:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 07:10:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 02:47:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

While several machine learning methods have\nbeen developed for herb recommendation, they are limited in modeling only the\ninteractions between herbs and symptoms, and ignoring the intermediate process\nof syndrome induction. When performing TCM diagnostics, an experienced doctor\ntypically induces syndromes from the patient's symptoms and then suggests herbs\nbased on the induced syndromes. As such, we believe the induction of syndromes,\nan overall description of the symptoms, is important for herb recommendation\nand should be properly handled. However, due to the ambiguity and complexity of\nsyndrome induction, most prescriptions lack the explicit ground truth of\nsyndromes. In this paper, we propose a new method that takes the implicit\nsyndrome induction process into account for herb recommendation. Given a set of\nsymptoms to treat, we aim to generate an overall syndrome representation by\neffectively fusing the embeddings of all the symptoms in the set, to mimic how\na doctor induces the syndromes. Towards symptom embedding learning, we\nadditionally construct a symptom-symptom graph from the input prescriptions for\ncapturing the relations between symptoms; we then build graph convolution\nnetworks(GCNs) on both symptom-symptom and symptom-herb graphs to learn symptom\nembedding. Similarly, we construct a herb-herb graph and build GCNs on both\nherb-herb and symptom-herb graphs to learn herb embedding, which is finally\ninteracted with the syndrome representation to predict the scores of herbs. In\nthis way, more comprehensive representations can be obtained. We conduct\nextensive experiments on a public TCM dataset, showing significant improvements\nover state-of-the-art herb recommendation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 05:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-21"}

The study of the orthogonality dimension of graphs is\nmotivated by various applications in information theory and in theoretical\ncomputer science. The contribution of the present work is two-fold.\n  First, we prove that there exists a constant $c$ such that for every\nsufficiently large integer $t$, it is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard to decide whether the\northogonality dimension of an input graph over $\\mathbb{R}$ is at most $t$ or\nat least $3t/2-c$.

Comb. Theo. Ser.

Recent evolutionary studies have suggested that\nterrestrial planets in the habitable zone of M-dwarfs are probably tidally\nlocked and have limited surface water inventories as a result of their host\nstars' high early luminosities. Several previous climate simulations of such\nplanets have indicated that their remaining water would be transported to the\nplanet's permanent nightside and become trapped as surface ice, leaving the\ndayside devoid of water.

A finite Indian buffet process is\nused to model subpopulations as latent features, and a model-based method based\non these latent feature subpopulations is used to construct cell clusters\nwithin each sample. Non-ignorable missing data due to technical artifacts in\nmass cytometry instruments are accounted for by defining a static missing data\nmechanism. In contrast to conventional cell clustering methods based on\nobserved marker expression levels that are applied separately to different\nsamples, the FAM based method can be applied simultaneously to multiple\nsamples, and can identify important cell subpopulations likely to be missed by\nconventional clustering.

Taking into account of the\nfinite-resolution phase shifts of PMSs, a novel beam training approach is\nproposed, which achieves comparable performance as the exhaustive beam\nsearching method but with much lower time overhead. Then, a closed-form\nexpression for the achievable multicast rate is presented, which is valid for\narbitrary system configurations. In addition, for certain asymptotic scenario,\nsimple approximated expressions for the multicase rate are derived. Closed-form\nsolutions are obtained for the optimal power allocation scheme, and it is shown\nthat equal power allocation is optimal when the pilot power or the number of\nreflecting elements is sufficiently large. However, it is desirable to allocate\nmore power to weaker users when there are a large number of RF chains. The\nanalytical findings indicate that, with large pilot power, the multicast rate\nis determined by the weakest user. Also, increasing the number of radio\nfrequency (RF) chains or reflecting elements can significantly improve the\nmulticast rate, and as the phase shift number becomes larger, the multicast\nrate improves first and gradually converges to a limit. Moreover, increasing\nthe number of users would significantly degrade the multicast rate, but this\nrate loss can be compensated by implementing a large number of reflecting\nelements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 08:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-21"}

Such a\nmodel subsumes NxM models with different number of encoder and decoder layers,\nand can be used for decoding with fewer than the maximum number of encoder and\ndecoder layers.

However, all existing methods either fail to utilize the orthogonal\nproperty of the representations generated by GAE, or separate the clustering\nand the learning of neural networks.

Driven by\ntheoretical analysis about relaxed k-means, we design a specific GAE-based\nmodel for graph clustering to be consistent with the theory, namely Embedding\nGraph Auto-Encoder (EGAE).

To\nfurther induce the neural network to produce deep features that are appropriate\nfor the specific clustering model, the relaxed k-means and GAE are learned\nsimultaneously. Therefore, the relaxed k-means can be equivalently regarded as\na decoder that attempts to learn representations that can be linearly\nconstructed by some centroid vectors.

What is more\nis that although the area formulas and minimal area equations of the two\nregions are quite different, the HEE have very similar behavior on the QCD\nphase diagram. So we argue that the behavior of HEE on the QCD phase diagram is\nindependent of the shape of subregions. However, as we know that HEE is not a\ngood quantity to characterize the entanglement between different subregions of\na thermal system. So we then study the mutual information (MI), conditional\nmutual information (CMI) and the entanglement of purification (Ep) in different\nstrip shaped regions. We find that the three entanglement quantities have very\nsimilar behavior: their values do not change so much in the hadronic matter\nphase and then rise up quickly with the increase of $T$ and $\\m$ in the QGP\nphase.

Detection of code clones can help to reduce\nthe cost of software maintenance and prevent bugs. Numerous approaches of\ndetecting code clones have been proposed previously, but most of them focus on\ndetecting syntactic clones and do not work well on semantic clones with\ndifferent syntactic features. To detect semantic clones, researchers have tried\nto adopt deep learning for code clone detection to automatically learn latent\nsemantic features from data. Especially, to leverage grammar information,\nseveral approaches used abstract syntax trees (AST) as input and achieved\nsignificant progress on code clone benchmarks in various programming languages.\nHowever, these AST-based approaches still can not fully leverage the structural\ninformation of code fragments, especially semantic information such as control\nflow and data flow. To leverage control and data flow information, in this\npaper, we build a graph representation of programs called flow-augmented\nabstract syntax tree (FA-AST). We construct FA-AST by augmenting original ASTs\nwith explicit control and data flow edges. Then we apply two different types of\ngraph neural networks (GNN) on FA-AST to measure the similarity of code pairs.\nAs far as we have concerned, we are the first to apply graph neural networks on\nthe domain of code clone detection.\n  We apply our FA-AST and graph neural networks on two Java datasets: Google\nCode Jam and BigCloneBench.

Unlike previous methods\nwhich use trace points or image pixels as basic units, SCAN makes full use of\nstroke-level information for better alignment and representation. The proposed\nSCAN can be adopted in both single-modal (online or offline) and multi-modal\nHMER. For single-modal HMER, SCAN first employs a CNN-GRU encoder to extract\npoint-level features from input traces in online mode and employs a CNN encoder\nto extract pixel-level features from input images in offline mode, then use\nstroke constrained information to convert them into online and offline\nstroke-level features. Using stroke-level features can explicitly group points\nor pixels belonging to the same stroke, therefore reduces the difficulty of\nsymbol segmentation and recognition via the decoder with attention mechanism.\nFor multi-modal HMER, other than fusing multi-modal information in decoder,\nSCAN can also fuse multi-modal information in encoder by utilizing the stroke\nbased alignments between online and offline modalities. The encoder fusion is a\nbetter way for combining multi-modal information as it implements the\ninformation interaction one step before the decoder fusion so that the\nadvantages of multiple modalities can be exploited earlier and more adequately\nwhen training the encoder-decoder model. Evaluated on a benchmark published by\nCROHME competition, the proposed SCAN achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 11:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-21"}

At the\nhigh frequencies, the computed spatial spectrum of the surface waves is close\nto $k^{-5/2}$ which corresponds to $\\omega^{-5/3}$ in terms of the frequency.\nThis spectrum does not coincide with the Zakharov-Filonenko spectrum obtained\nfor pure capillary waves. A possible explanation of this fact is in the\ninfluence of coherent structures (like shock waves) usually arising in media\nwith weak dispersion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 12:21:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-21"}

We discuss this phenomenon in\nterms of both, the electron-phonon interaction controlling the energy\nrelaxation of hot carriers, and the shape of the initial carrier distribution.\nFinally, we present a phenomenological approach to simulate the carrier\ngeneration volume that can be used for the investigation of the temperature\ndependence of carrier diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 13:00:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 11:41:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 07:33:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 16:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

All films crystallize in a pseudo\nbody-centered cubic (BCC) structure. For samples with x < 0.65, the\nnormal-state properties are metallic, while for x > 0.65 the films are weakly\ninsulating. The transition from metallic to weakly insulating occurs right at\nthe near-equimolar stoichiometry. We find all films, except for x = 0 or 1, to\nbecome superconducting at low temperatures, and we interpret their\nsuperconducting properties within the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)\nframework. The highest transition temperature T_c = 6.9 K of the solid solution\nis observed for x = 0.43. The highest upper-critical field B_c2(0) = 11.05 T is\nfound for the near-equimolar ratio x = 0.65, where the mixing entropy is the\nlargest. The superconducting parameters derived for all the films from\ntransport measurements are found to be close to those that are reported for\namorphous superconductors.

Although the secular evolution of triples and quadruples has\nbeen explored before, a systematic study of the systems in the MSC including\nalso quintuples and sextuples has not been carried out. Here, we explore the\nmain-sequence (MS) evolution of stars from the MSC based on approximately\n2x10^5 secular dynamical integrations.

The larger fractions of strong interactions\nand dynamical instability in systems with increasing multiplicity can be\nattributed to increasingly complex secular evolution in these systems.

The faster rotation of the Sun in the past lead to a more\nvigorous action of solar dynamo and thus potentially to larger amplitude of the\nSSI variability on the timescale of the solar activity cycle. This could led to\na stronger response of the Earth's atmosphere as well as other solar system\nplanets' atmospheres to the solar activity cycle.

In this vein, we propose a new class of\noptimizer, DDP Neural Optimizer (DDPNOpt), for training feedforward and\nconvolution networks. DDPNOpt features layer-wise feedback policies which\nimprove convergence and reduce sensitivity to hyper-parameter over existing\nmethods. It outperforms other optimal-control inspired training methods in both\nconvergence and complexity, and is competitive against state-of-the-art first\nand second order methods. We also observe DDPNOpt has surprising benefit in\npreventing gradient vanishing. Our work opens up new avenues for principled\nalgorithmic design built upon the optimal control theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 15:42:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 16:51:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 8 May 2021 21:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

An interesting and important\nfeature of the model is that this interface field obeys a curl involution\nconstraint, that is, the vector field is required to be curl-free at all times.\n  The proposed modifications are intended to restore the strong hyperbolicity\nof the model, and are closely related to divergence-preserving numerical\napproaches developed in the field of numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The\nfirst strategy is based on the theory of Symmetric Hyperbolic and\nThermodynamically Compatible (SHTC) systems forwarded by Godunov in the 60s and\n70s and yields a modified system of governing equations which includes some\nsymmetrisation terms, in analogy to the approach adopted later by Powell et al\nfor the ideal MHD equations.

While seismic slip of\nsmall faults or fault patches is detectable as microseismic events, the role of\naseismic slip is poorly understood. From a modeling standpoint, geomechanical\nanalysis using the Coulomb criterion can determine if faults slip but not\nwhether slip is seismic or aseismic. Here we propose a computational\nmethodology to predict fault slip, and whether slip is seismic or aseismic,\nusing rate-and-state friction. To avoid computational costs associated with\nresolving small faults, we use the spring-slider idealization that treats\nfaults as points. Interaction between faults is neglected. The method is\napplied to study fault slip from a hydraulic fracture that grows past a fault,\nwithout intersecting it. We represent the hydraulic fracture stressing using an\nasymptotic expansion of stresses around the tip of a tensile crack. We\ninvestigate the effect of fault length, orientation, and distance from the\nhydraulic fracture. For velocity-weakening faults with stiffness smaller than a\ncritical stiffness, slip is seismic, whereas faults with stiffness greater than\nthe critical stiffness slip aseismically. Furthermore, we compare the\nspring-slider idealization with a finite element analysis that resolves\nspatially variable slip. The spring-slider idealization provides reasonably\naccurate predictions of moment and even moment-rate history, especially for\nfaults having stiffness close to or larger than the critical stiffness.\nDifferences appear for large faults where rupture propagation is important,\nthough differences might still be negligible for many applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 22:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-24"}

First, we consider ARES, an approximation\nalgorithm for generating optimal plans (action sequences) that take an initial\nstate of an MDP to a state whose cost is below a specified (convergence)\nthreshold. ARES uses Particle Swarm Optimization, with adaptive sizing for both\nthe receding horizon and the particle swarm.

By employing consistent definitions for fractional-order\nkinematic relations, the governing equations and the associated boundary\nconditions are derived based on variational principles. Remarkably, the\nfractional-order nonlocal model gives rise to a self-adjoint and\npositive-definite system that accepts a unique solution. Further, owing to the\ndifficulty in obtaining analytical solutions to this fractional-order\ndiffer-integral problem, a 2D finite element model for the fractional-order\ngoverning equations is presented. Following a thorough validation with\nbenchmark problems, the 2D fractional finite element model is used to study the\nstatic as well as the free dynamic response of fractional-order plates subject\nto various loading and boundary conditions. It is established that the\nfractional-order nonlocality leads to a reduction in the stiffness of the plate\nstructure thereby increasing the displacements and reducing the natural\nfrequency of vibration of the plates. Further, it is seen that the effect of\nnonlocality is stronger on the higher modes of vibration when compared to the\nfundamental mode. These effects of the fractional-order nonlocality are noted\nirrespective of the nature of the boundary conditions. More specifically, the\nfractional-order model of nonlocal plates is free from boundary effects that\nlead to paradoxical predictions such as hardening and absence of nonlocal\neffects in classical integral approaches to nonlocal elasticity. This\nconsistency in the predictions is a result of the well-posed nature of the\nfractional-order governing equations that accept a unique solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 22:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

In general, clickstream data can be\nconsidered as a sequence of log events collected at different levels of web/app\nusage. The analysis of clickstream data can be performed directly as sequence\nanalysis or by extracting features from sequences. In this work, we show how\nrepresenting and saving the sequences with their underlying graph structures\ncan induce a platform for customer behavior analysis. Our main idea is that\nclickstream data containing sequences of actions of an application, are walks\nof the corresponding finite state automaton (FSA) of that application. Our\nhypothesis is that the customers of an application normally do not use all\npossible walks through that FSA and the number of actual walks is much smaller\nthan total number of possible walks through the FSA. Sequences of such a walk\nnormally consist of a finite number of cycles on FSA graphs. Identifying and\nmatching these cycles in the classical sequence analysis is not straight\nforward.

We\nverified through Monte Carlo simulations that the equilibrium suggested by the\nODE method indeed represents the limit of the dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 11:53:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 04:23:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2021 14:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

To allow for landscape structural\nanalysis and scenario generation, we here develop statistical tools for real\nlandscapes composed of geometric elements including 2D patches but also 1D\nlinear elements such as hedges. We design generative stochastic models that\ncombine a multiplex network representation and Gibbs energy terms to\ncharacterize the distributional behavior of landscape descriptors for land-use\ncategories. We implement Metropolis-Hastings for this new class of models to\nsample agricultural scenarios featuring parameter-controlled spatial and\ntemporal patterns (e.g., geometry, connectivity, crop-rotation).\nPseudolikelihood-based inference allows studying the relevance of model\ncomponents in real landscapes through statistical and functional validation,\nthe latter achieved by comparing commonly used landscape metrics between\nobserved and simulated landscapes. Models fitted to subregions of the Lower\nDurance Valley (France) indicate strong deviation from random allocation, and\nthey realistically capture small-scale landscape patterns. In summary, our\napproach of statistical modeling improves the understanding of structural and\nfunctional aspects of agro-ecosystems, and it enables simulation-based\ntheoretical analysis of how landscape patterns shape biological and ecological\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 09:07:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-05"}

Aflatoxin\ndetection and measurement relies mainly on chemical methods usually based on\nchromatography approaches, and recently developed immunochemical based assays\nthat have advantages but also limitations, since these are expensive and\ndestructive techniques. Nondestructive, optical approaches are recently being\ndeveloped to assess presence of contamination in a cost and time effective way,\nmaintaining acceptable accuracy and reproducibility. In this paper are\npresented the results obtained with a simple portable device for nondestructive\ndetection of aflatoxins in almonds. The presented approach is based on the\nanalysis of fluorescence spectra of slurried almonds under 375 nm wavelength\nexcitation. Experiments were conducted with almonds contaminated in the range\nof 2.7-320.2 ng/g total aflatoxins B (AFB1 + AFB2) as determined by HPLC/FLD.\nAfter applying pre-processing steps, spectral analysis was carried out by a\nbinary classification model based on SVM algorithm. A majority vote procedure\nwas then performed on the classification results. In this way we could achieve,\nas best result, a classification accuracy of 94% (and false negative rate 5%)\nwith a threshold set at 6.4 ng/g. These results illustrate the feasibility of\nsuch an approach in the great challenge of aflatoxin detection for food and\nfeed safety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 14:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

Recently, the unprecedentedly\nlarge refractive-index contrast between the amorphous and crystalline states of\nGe-Sb-Te (GST)-based phase-change materials (PCMs) has attracted tremendous\nattention for reconfigurable integrated nanophotonics. Here, we introduce a\nmicroheater platform that employs optically transparent and electrically\nconductive indium-tin-oxide (ITO) bridges for the fast and reversible\nelectrical switching of the GST phase between crystalline and amorphous states.\nBy the proper assignment of electrical pulses applied to the ITO microheater,\nwe show that our platform allows for the registration of virtually any\nintermediate crystalline state into the GST film integrated on the top of the\ndesigned microheaters. More importantly, we demonstrate the full reversibility\nof the GST phase between amorphous and crystalline states. To show the\nfeasibility of using this hybrid GST/ITO platform for miniaturized integrated\nnanophotonic structures, we integrate our designed microheaters into the arms\nof a Mach-Zehnder interferometer to realize electrically reconfigurable optical\nphase shifters with orders of magnitude smaller footprints compared to existing\nintegrated photonic architectures. We show that the phase of optical signals\ncan be gradually shifted in multiple intermediate states using a structure that\ncan potentially be smaller than a single wavelength. We believe that our study\nshowcases the possibility of forming a whole new class of miniaturized\nreconfigurable integrated nanophotonics using beyond-binary reconfiguration of\noptical functionalities in hybrid PCM-photonic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 03:58:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 02:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}
