Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can potentially\nattain this flexibility by superimposing user signals while offering improved\nspectral efficiency (SE). However, users with different numerologies have\ndifferent symbol durations. When combined with NOMA, this changes the nature of\nthe interference the users impose on each other. This paper investigates a\nmultinumerology NOMA (MN-NOMA) scheme using successive interference\ncancellation (SIC) as an enabler for coexistence of users with with different\nnumerologies. Analytical expressions for the inter-numerology interference\n(INI) experienced by each user at the receiver are derived, where mean-squared\nerror (MSE) is the metric used to quantify INI. Using the MSE expressions, we\nanalytically derive achievable rates for each user in the MN-NOMA system.

In the semiclassical\nregime, open systems can be described by phenomenological effective\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonians (NHHs) capturing the effects of gain and loss in\nterms of imaginary fields. The EPs that characterize the spectra of such\nHamiltonians (HEPs) describe the time evolution of a system without quantum\njumps.

In particular, we\nconsider the problems of identity retrieval and soft biometrics labelling in\nvisual surveillance environments, which have been attracting growing interests.\nInspired by the triplet loss [34] function, we propose a generalization that:\n1) defines a metric that considers the number of agreeing labels between pairs\nof elements; and 2) disregards the notion of anchor, replacing d(A1, A2) <\nd(A1, B) by d(A, B) < d(C, D), for A, B, C, D distance constraints, according\nto the number of agreeing labels between pairs. As the triplet loss\nformulation, our proposal also privileges small distances between positive\npairs, but at the same time explicitly enforces that the distance between other\npairs corresponds directly to their similarity in terms of agreeing labels.\nThis yields feature embeddings with a strong correspondence between the classes\ncentroids and their semantic descriptions, i.e., where elements are closer to\nothers that share some of their labels than to elements with fully disjoint\nlabels membership. As practical effect, the proposed loss can be seen as\nparticularly suitable for performing joint coarse (soft label) + fine (ID)\ninference, based on simple rules as k-neighbours, which is a novelty with\nrespect to previous related loss functions. Also, in opposition to its triplet\ncounterpart, the proposed loss is agnostic with regard to any demanding\ncriteria for mining learning instances (such as the semi-hard pairs).

However, intense theoretical interest is now\nfocused on whether a pair density wave state (PDW) could coexist with cuprate\nsuperconductivity (D. F. Agterberg et al., Annual Review of Condensed Matter\nPhysics 11, 231 (2020)). Here, we use a strong-coupling mean-field theory of\ncuprates, to model the atomic-scale electronic structure of an eight-unit-cell\nperiodic, $d$-symmetry form factor, pair density wave (PDW) state coexisting\nwith $d$-wave superconductivity (DSC).

The PDW+DSC model predictions include the intra-unit-cell\nstructure and periodic modulations of N(r,E), the modulations of the coherence\npeak energy $\\Delta_p$ (r), and the characteristics of Bogoliubov quasiparticle\ninterference in scattering-wavevector space (q-space). Consistency between all\nthese predictions and the corresponding experiments indicates that lightly\nhole-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$ does contain a PDW+DSC state. Moreover, in\nthe model the PDW+DSC state becomes unstable to a pure DSC state at a critical\nhole density p*, with empirically equivalent phenomena occurring in the\nexperiments. All these results are consistent with a picture in which the\ncuprate translational symmetry breaking state is a PDW, the observed charge\nmodulations are its consequence, the antinodal pseudogap is that of the PDW\nstate, and the cuprate critical point at p* ~ 19% occurs due to disappearance\nof this PDW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 17:30:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 04:08:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

Valuable insight can be gained into these\nquestions by studying some of the most extreme examples of the processes at\nplay. The super-slowly rotating rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) star HD 166473 is\nsuch an example. We performed the first accurate determination of its rotation\nperiod, (3836 +/- 30)d, from the analysis of 56 measurements of the mean\nmagnetic field modulus <B> based on high-resolution spectra acquired between\n1992 and 2019 at various observatories and with various instrumental\nconfigurations. We complemented this analysis with the consideration of an\ninhomogeneous set of 21 determinations of the mean longitudinal magnetic field\n<B_z> spanning the same time interval. This makes HD 166473 one of only four Ap\nstars with a period longer than 10 years for which magnetic field measurements\nhave been obtained over more than a full cycle. The variation curves of <B> and\nof <B_z> are well approximated by cosine waves.

Among the stars with rotation periods\nlonger than 1000 d for which magnetic field measurements with full phase\ncoverage are available, HD 166473 has the strongest field. Its magnetic field\nis also one of the strongest known among roAp stars. Overall, the magnetic\nproperties of HD 166473 do not seem fundamentally distinct from those of the\nfaster-rotating Ap stars.

In this paper, we\nuse MHD simulations with the appropriate thermodynamical terms included to\nquantify the evaporation following heating by phase mixing of Alfv\\'en waves in\na coronal loop and the effect of this evaporation on the transverse density\nprofile. The numerical simulations were performed using the Lare2D code. We set\nup a 2D loop model consisting of a field-aligned thermodynamic equilibrium and\na cross-field (background) heating profile. A continuous, sinusoidal,\nhigh-frequency Alfv\\'en wave driver was implemented. As the Alfv\\'en waves\npropagate along the field, they undergo phase mixing due to the cross-field\ndensity gradient in the coronal part of the loop. We investigated the presence\nof field-aligned flows, heating from the dissipation of the phase-mixed\nAlfv\\'en waves, and the subsequent evaporation from the lower atmosphere. We\nfind that phase mixing of Alfv\\'en waves leads to modest heating in the shell\nregions of the loop and evaporation of chromospheric material into the corona\nwith upflows of the order of only 5-20 m/s. Although the evaporation leads to a\nmass increase in the shell regions of the loop, the effect on the density\ngradient and, hence, on the phase mixing process, is insignificant.

In this scheme, dilatonic effects, are incorporated in the metric\nas a deformation of the AdS space. We apply the model also to the heavy meson\nspectra with success. We obtain quadratic mass equations for all scalar mesons\nwhile the glueballs satisfy an almost linear mass equation.

Galaxy\nevolution scenarios suggest three pathways to form an XMP: (1) secular\nevolution at low galaxy masses, (2) slow evolution in voids, or (3) dilution of\nmeasured abundances from infall of pristine gas. The recently discovered XMP\ngalaxy Leoncino, with an oxygen abundance below 3% Zsun, provides an\nopportunity to explore these different scenarios. Using Hubble Space Telescope\nimaging of the resolved stellar populations of Leoncino, we measure the\ndistance to the galaxy to be D=12.1 (+1.7/-3.4) Mpc and find that Leoncino is\nlocated in an under-dense environment. Leoncino has a compact morphology, hosts\na population of young, massive stars, has a high gas-to-star mass ratio, and\nshows signs of interaction with a galaxy nearby on the sky, UGC 5186. Similar\nto nearly all XMP galaxies known in the nearby universe, Leoncino is offset\nfrom the Luminosity-Metallicity (LZ) relation. Yet, Leoncino is consistent with\nthe stellar Mass-Metallicity (MZ) relation defined by Local Volume galaxies.\nThus, our results suggest that the offset from the LZ relation is due to higher\nrecent star formation, likely triggered by a minor interaction, while the low\noxygen abundance is consistent with the expectation that low-mass galaxies will\nundergo secular evolution marked by inefficient star formation and metal-loss\nvia galactic winds. This is in contrast to XMP galaxies that are outliers in\nboth the LZ and MZ relations; in such cases, the low oxygen abundances are best\nexplained by dilution due to the infall of pristine gas. We also discuss why\nquiescent XMP galaxies are underrepresented in current surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

We\nuse a homogeneously selected sample of field and cluster galaxies whose\nmembership is derived from dynamical analysis. Using [OII]-derived star\nformation rates (SFRs), we find that cluster galaxies have suppressed SFRs at\nfixed stellar mass in comparison to their field counterparts by a factor of 1.4\n$\\pm$ 0.1 ($\\sim3.3\\sigma$) across the stellar mass range: $9.0 < \\log(M_{*}\n/M_{\\odot}) < 11.2$. We also find that this modest suppression in the cluster\ngalaxy star-forming main sequence is mass and redshift dependent: the\ndifference between cluster and field increases towards lower stellar masses and\nlower redshift. When comparing the distribution of cluster and field galaxy\nSFRs to the star-forming main sequence, we find an overall shift towards lower\nSFRs in the cluster population, and note the absence of a tail of high SFR\ngalaxies as seen in the field. Given this observed suppression in the cluster\ngalaxy star-forming main sequence, we explore the implications for several\nscenarios such as formation time differences between cluster and field\ngalaxies, and environmentally-induced star formation quenching and associated\ntimescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 11:45:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 10:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

We generalize randomized smoothing to defend against\nbackdoor attacks. Our results show the theoretical feasibility of using\nrandomized smoothing to certify robustness against backdoor attacks. However,\nwe also find that existing randomized smoothing methods have limited\neffectiveness at defending against backdoor attacks, which highlight the needs\nof new theory and methods to certify robustness against backdoor attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:15:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2020 18:53:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 13:02:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 16:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

The use of ZDI maps has advantages over other methods\nbecause it allows information about the magnetic field geometry to be\nincorporated into the estimate. However, ZDI is known to underestimate\nphotospheric field strengths due to flux cancellation effects. Recently,\nLehmann et al. (2018) conducted synthetic ZDI reconstructions on a set of flux\ntransport simulations to help quantify the amount by which ZDI underestimates\nthe field strengths of relatively slowly rotating and weak activity solar-like\nstars.

Planck observations demonstrated that the grain alignment efficiency\nis almost constant in the diffuse ISM. Aims. We test if the Radiative Torque\n(RAT) theory is compatible with observational constraints on grain alignment.\nMethods. We combine a numerical simulation with the radiative transfer code\nPOLARIS that incorporates a physical dust model and the detailed grain\nalignment physics of RATs. A dust model is designed to reproduce the spectral\ndependence of extinction of the ISM. From a RAMSES simulation of interstellar\nturbulence, we extract a cube representative of the diffuse ISM. We\npost-process the cube with POLARIS to get the grain temperature and RATs to\nsimulate synthetic dust polarization maps. Results. In our simulation the grain\nalignment efficiency is correlated with gas pressure, but not with the RAT\nintensity. Because of the low dust extinction, the magnitude of RATs varies\nlittle, decreasing only for high column densities $N_H$. Comparing our maps\nwith a uniform alignment efficiency, we find no systematic difference. The\ndependence of polarization fraction $p$ with $N_H$ or polarization dispersion\n$S$ is similar. The drop of RATs in dense regions barely affects the\npolarization pattern, the signal being dominated by the LOS and magnetic field\ngeometry. If a star is inserted, the polarization increases, with no specific\npattern around the star. The angle-dependence of RATs is not observed in the\nmaps, and is weak using a uniform magnetic field. Conclusions. RATs are\ncompatible with Planck data for the diffuse ISM such that both uniform\nalignment and RAT alignment lead to similar observations. To further test the\npredictions of RATs where an important drop of grain alignment is expected,\npolarization observations of dense regions must be confronted to numerical\nsimulations sampling high column densities through dense clouds, with enough\nstatistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 21:08:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

In particular, our synthesized policies only require\nrelative state information of nearby neighbors and obstacles, and compute a\nprovably-safe action. Our approach has three major components: i) we generate\ndemonstration trajectories using a global planner and extract local\nobservations from them, ii) we use deep imitation learning to learn a\ndecentralized policy that can run efficiently online, and iii) we introduce a\nnovel differentiable safety module to ensure collision-free operation, thereby\nallowing for end-to-end policy training. Our numerical experiments demonstrate\nthat our policies have a 20% higher success rate than optimal reciprocal\ncollision avoidance, ORCA, across a wide range of robot and obstacle densities.\nWe demonstrate our method on an aerial swarm, executing the policy on low-end\nmicrocontrollers in real-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 21:51:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 19:45:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2020 16:29:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

These services need to process massive\namounts of spatial data in real-time. The current scale of spatial data cannot\nbe handled using centralized systems. This has led to the development of\ndistributed spatial streaming systems. Existing systems are using static\nspatial partitioning to distribute the workload. In contrast, the real-time\nstreamed spatial data follows non-uniform spatial distributions that are\ncontinuously changing over time. Distributed spatial streaming systems need to\nreact to the changes in the distribution of spatial data and queries. This\npaper introduces SWARM, a light-weight adaptivity protocol that continuously\nmonitors the data and query workloads across the distributed processes of the\nspatial data streaming system, and redistribute and rebalance the workloads\nsoon as performance bottlenecks get detected. SWARM is able to handle multiple\nquery-execution and data-persistence models. A distributed streaming system can\ndirectly use SWARM to adaptively rebalance the system's workload among its\nmachines with minimal changes to the original code of the underlying spatial\napplication. Extensive experimental evaluation using real and synthetic\ndatasets illustrate that, on average, SWARM achieves 200% improvement over a\nstatic grid partitioning that is determined based on observing a limited\nhistory of the data and query workloads. Moreover, SWARM reduces execution\nlatency on average 4x compared with the other technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 00:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-28"}

This paper aims to provide a\ncomprehensive analysis of local minimax points, such as their relation with\nother solution concepts and their optimality conditions.

In\n(non-convex) quadratic games, we show that local minimax points are (in some\nsense) equivalent to global minimax points. Finally, we study the stability of\ngradient algorithms near local minimax points. Although gradient algorithms can\nconverge to local/global minimax points in the non-degenerate case, they would\noften fail in general cases.

This is uncharacteristic\nof many real-life scenarios where discrepancies between the expert and the\nimitator MDPs are common, especially in the transition dynamics function.\nFurthermore, obtaining expert actions may be costly or infeasible, making the\nrecent trend towards state-only IL (where expert demonstrations constitute only\nstates or observations) ever so promising.

However, RNN is prone to diluting long-term information.\nRecent works have demonstrated memory network (MemNet) has the advantage of\nstoring long-term information. However, as the decoder, it has not been well\nexploited for video captioning. The reason partially comes from the difficulty\nof sequence decoding with MemNet. Instead of the common practice, i.e.,\nsequence decoding with RNN, in this paper, we devise a novel memory decoder for\nvideo captioning. Concretely, after obtaining representation of each frame\nthrough a pre-trained network, we first fuse the visual and lexical\ninformation. Then, at each time step, we construct a multi-layer MemNet-based\ndecoder, i.e., in each layer, we employ a memory set to store previous\ninformation and an attention mechanism to select the information related to the\ncurrent input. Thus, this decoder avoids the dilution of long-term information.\nAnd the multi-layer architecture is helpful for capturing dependencies between\nframes and word sequences. Experimental results show that even without the\nencoding network, our decoder still could obtain competitive performance and\noutperform the performance of RNN decoder.

On the one hand, existing methods\nuncouple the procedures of hash function learning and graph construction. On\nthe other hand, graphs empirically built upon original data could introduce\nbiased prior knowledge of data relevance, leading to sub-optimal retrieval\nperformance. In this paper, we tackle the above problems by proposing an\nefficient and adaptive code-driven graph, which is updated by decoding in the\ncontext of an auto-encoder. Specifically, we introduce into our framework twin\nbottlenecks (i.e., latent variables) that exchange crucial information\ncollaboratively. One bottleneck (i.e., binary codes) conveys the high-level\nintrinsic data structure captured by the code-driven graph to the other (i.e.,\ncontinuous variables for low-level detail information), which in turn\npropagates the updated network feedback for the encoder to learn more\ndiscriminative binary codes. The auto-encoding learning objective literally\nrewards the code-driven graph to learn an optimal encoder. Moreover, the\nproposed model can be simply optimized by gradient descent without violating\nthe binary constraints. Experiments on benchmarked datasets clearly show the\nsuperiority of our framework over the state-of-the-art hashing methods.

This visual discrepancy leads to\ngreat difficulty in unsupervised discriminative learning. Fortunately, in\nreal-world tasks we could often know the states without human annotation, e.g.\nwe can easily have the camera view labels in person re-identification and\nfacial pose labels in face recognition.

The angular\nmomentum vector orientation of Krylov is found to be $\\lambda_{L} = 298^\\circ$\nand $\\beta_{L} = -58^\\circ$. The ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to the\nbasic spin state energy $E/E_{0} \\simeq 1.02$ shows that the (5247) Krylov is\nabout 2% excited state compared to the Principal Axis (PA) rotation state. The\nshape of (5247) Krylov can be approximated by an elongated prolate ellipsoid\nwith a ratio of moments of inertia of $I_{a}:I_{b}:I_{c}=0.36:0.96:1$. This is\nthe first physical model of NPA rotator among MBAs. The physical processes that\nled to the current NPA rotation cannot be unambiguously reconstructed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 07:24:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 22:36:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-30"}

Given such SGG, the down-stream tasks\nsuch as VQA can hardly infer better scene structures than merely a bag of\nobjects. However, debiasing in SGG is not trivial because traditional debiasing\nmethods cannot distinguish between the good and bad bias, e.g., good context\nprior (e.g., \"person read book\" rather than \"eat\") and bad long-tailed bias\n(e.g., \"near\" dominating \"behind / in front of\"). In this paper, we present a\nnovel SGG framework based on causal inference but not the conventional\nlikelihood. We first build a causal graph for SGG, and perform traditional\nbiased training with the graph.

While this relatively small\nnumber of planets in binaries is probably partly due to strong observational\nbiases, there is, however, statistical evidence that planets are indeed less\nfrequent in binaries with separations smaller than 100 au, strongly suggesting\nthat the presence of a close in companion star has an adverse effect on planet\nformation. It is indeed possible for the gravitational pull of the second star\nto affect all the different stages of planet formation, from proto-planetary\ndisk formation to dust accumulation into planetesimals, to the accretion of\nthese planetesimals into large planetary embryos and, eventually, the final\ngrowth of these embryos into planets. For the crucial planetesimal accretion\nphase, the complex coupling between dynamical perturbations from the binary and\nfriction due to gas in the protoplanetary disk suggests that planetesimal\naccretion might be hampered due to increased, accretion hostile impact\nvelocities. Likewise, the interplay between the binary secular perturbations\nand mean motion resonances lead to unstable regions, where not only planet\nformation is inhibited, but where a massive body would be ejected from the\nsystem on a hyperbolic orbit. The amplitude of these two main effects is\ndifferent for S and P type planets, so that a comparison between the two\npopulations might outline the influence of the companion star on the planet\nformation process. Unfortunately, at present the two populations (circumstellar\nor circumbinary) are not known equally well and different biases and\nuncertainties prevent a quantitative comparison. We also highlight the long\nterm dynamical evolution of both S and P type systems and focus on how these\ndifferent evolutions influence the final architecture of planetary systems in\nbinaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 09:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-28"}

However, a caveat here is\nthat the model confidence may be unreliable, which may lead to incorrect\npredictions. To tackle this issue, we propose to meta-learn the confidence for\neach query sample, to assign optimal weights to unlabeled queries such that\nthey improve the model's transductive inference performance on unseen tasks.

New technological advances\nhave enabled simultaneous tuning of the radio-frequency resonance circuits to\nnuclei with close Larmor frequencies, bringing a great promise also to distance\nmeasurements between such nuclei, in particular for nuclei with a spin larger\nthan one-half. However, this new possibility has also required modifications of\nthose experiments since the two nuclei cannot be irradiated simultaneously.\nWhen measuring distances between a spin S=1/2 and a quadrupolar spin (S > 1/2),\nthis drawback can be overcome by splitting the continuous-wave recoupling pulse\napplied to the quadrupolar nucleus. We show here that a similar adjustment to a\nhighly-efficient phase-modulated (PM) recoupling pulse enables distance\nmeasurements between nuclei with close Larmor frequencies, where the coupled\nspin experiences a very large coupling. Such an experiment, split\nphase-modulated RESPDOR, is demonstrated on a 13C-81Br system, where the\ndifference in Larmor frequencies is only 7%, or 11.2 MHz on a 14.1T magnet. The\ninter-nuclear distances are extracted using an unscaled analytical formula.\nSince bromine usually experiences particularly high quadrupolar couplings, as\nin the current case, we suggest that the split-PM-RESPDOR experiment can be\nhighly beneficial for the research of bromo-compounds, including many\npharmaceuticals, where carbon-bromine bonds are prevalent, and organo-catalysts\nutilizing the high reactivity of bromides.

The\nusefulness of IT has been argued to extend beyond its applicability at marginal\nrigidity. It has been shown to be derivable from first principles in\ntwo-dimensions, with the structure quantified by a fabric tensor that couples\nto the stress field.

By\nstudying the mutual information between the function learned by a VAE on the\noriginal data and on the augmented data we show that MixUp distorts learned\nfunctions in a way that CutMix does not. We further demonstrate this by showing\nthat MixUp acts as a form of adversarial training, increasing robustness to\nattacks such as Deep Fool and Uniform Noise which produce examples similar to\nthose generated by MixUp. We argue that this distortion prevents models from\nlearning about sample specific features in the data, aiding generalisation\nperformance. In contrast, we suggest that CutMix works more like a traditional\naugmentation, improving performance by preventing memorisation without\ndistorting the data distribution. However, we argue that an MSDA which builds\non CutMix to include masks of arbitrary shape, rather than just square, could\nfurther prevent memorisation whilst preserving the data distribution in the\nsame way. To this end, we propose FMix, an MSDA that uses random binary masks\nobtained by applying a threshold to low frequency images sampled from Fourier\nspace. These random masks can take on a wide range of shapes and can be\ngenerated for use with one, two, and three dimensional data. FMix improves\nperformance over MixUp and CutMix, without an increase in training time, for a\nnumber of models across a range of data sets and problem settings, obtaining a\nnew single model state-of-the-art result on CIFAR-10 without external data.\nFinally, we show that a consequence of the difference between interpolating\nMSDA such as MixUp and masking MSDA such as FMix is that the two can be\ncombined to improve performance even further.

In this heterostructure, significant anomalous Hall effect can be\nobserved at temperatures up to at least 400 K, which is a record high\ntemperature for the observation of AHE in TMDs, and the large RAHE is more than\none order of magnitude larger than those previously reported value in\ntopological insulators or TMDs based heterostructures.

For example, animals navigate to goals via efficient\ncoordination of individual motor actions, and demonstrate natural solutions to\nproblems also faced by engineers. Recording individual body part positions\nduring large scale movement would therefore be useful. Such multi-scale\nobservations, however, are challenging. With video, for example, there is\ntypically a trade-off between the volume over which an animal can be recorded\nand spatial resolution within the volume. Even with high pixel-count cameras,\nmotion blur can be a challenge when using available light. Here we present a\nnew approach for tracking animals, such as insects, with an optical system that\nbypasses this tradeoff by actively pointing a telephoto video camera at the\nanimal. This system is based around high-speed pan-tilt mirrors which steer an\noptical path shared by a quadrant photodiode and a high-resolution, high-speed\ntelephoto video recording system. The mirror is directed to lock on to the\nimage of a 25-milligram retroreflector worn by the animal. This system allows\nhigh-magnification videography with reduced motion blur over a large tracking\nvolume. With our prototype, we obtained millisecond order closed-loop latency\nand recorded videos of flying insects in a tracking volume extending to an\naxial distance of 3 meters and horizontally and vertically by 40 degrees. The\nsystem offers increased capabilities compared to other video recording\nsolutions and may be useful for the study of animal behavior and the design of\nbio-inspired robots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 14:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-28"}

Our detailed\nanalysis of CCADN raises a number of interesting questions.

To better understand the\nphysics acting in these systems during the outburst episode we performed\ndetailed temporal-, timing- and spectral analyses across the 0.3-300 keV band\nusing data from NICER, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and INTEGRAL. The hard X-ray 20-60\nkeV outburst profile is composed of four flares. During the maximum of the last\nflare we discovered a type-I thermonuclear burst in INTEGRAL JEM-X data. We\nderived a distance of 7.6+/-0.7 kpc, adopting Eddington luminosity limited\nphotospheric radius expansion burst emission and assuming anisotropic emission.\nIn the timing analysis using all NICER 1-10 keV monitoring data we observed a\nrather complex behaviour starting with a spin-up period, followed by a\nfrequency drop, a episode of constant frequency and concluding with irregular\nbehaviour till the end of the outburst. The 1-50 keV phase distributions of the\npulsed emission, detected up to $\\sim$ 120 keV using INTEGRAL ISGRI data, was\ndecomposed in three Fourier harmonics showing that the pulsed fraction of the\nfundamental increases from ~10% to ~17% going from ~1.5 to ~4 keV, while the\nharder photons arrive earlier than the soft photons for energies <10 keV. The\ntotal emission spectrum of IGR J17591-2342 across the 0.3-150 keV band could\nadequately be fitted in terms of an absorbed compPS model yielding as best fit\nparameters a column density of N_H=(2.09+/-0.05) x 10^{22} /cm2, a blackbody\nseed photon temperature kT_bb,seed of 0.64+/- 0.02 keV, electron temperature\nkT_e=38.8+/-1.2 keV and Thomson optical depth Tau_T=1.59+/-0.04.

The primary challenge\nof this task is to learn the robust feature against large viewpoint changes.\nExisting benchmarks can help, but are limited in the number of viewpoints.\nImage pairs, containing two viewpoints, e.g., satellite and ground, are usually\nprovided, which may compromise the feature learning. Besides phone cameras and\nsatellites, in this paper, we argue that drones could serve as the third\nplatform to deal with the geo-localization problem. In contrast to the\ntraditional ground-view images, drone-view images meet fewer obstacles, e.g.,\ntrees, and could provide a comprehensive view when flying around the target\nplace. To verify the effectiveness of the drone platform, we introduce a new\nmulti-view multi-source benchmark for drone-based geo-localization, named\nUniversity-1652.

In 4-dimensions effective theory the bosonic\nfields are: a $U(1)$ gauge boson, a Kalb-Ramond 3-form which is equivalent to a\npseudoscalar axion in 4-dimensions, the dilaton and the graviton. The coupling\nconstants in the theory are $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ (inverse string tension) and\n$\\kappa$ (inverse reduced Planck mass in 4-dimensions) and the charge of the\n$U(1)$ field and the axion-photon coupling are related to these two. Sen found\na black hole solution (the Kerr-Sen black hole) with these fields as the\nexternal hair of the black hole. In this paper we investigate the possibility\nof determining the Sen solution from observations. The observations which can\ntest the Kerr-Sen black hole are: (a) determination of the shape of the photon\nshadow, and (b) the rotation of polarization of photon due to axion hair. The\ndeviation from circularity gives the $U(1)$ charge of the black hole and\nidentification of this charge in terms of the photon coupling leads to a\nprediction of frequency independent \"Faraday rotation\" in terms of black hole\nparameters already determined from the shadow. Similar measurements of\nKerr-Newman black hole with axion hair have no correlation between the shape of\nthe image and the amount of \"Faraday rotation\". This correlation can be a\ndistinctive test of the Sen metric. In the recent observation from EHT of M87*\nshadow, the deviation from circularity has an upper bound of 10%. If this\nobservation is refined to 1% accuracy then a definitive prediction of the\ncharge of the Kerr-Sen black hole and the \"Faraday rotation\" can be made.\nInterestingly observations of \"Faraday rotation\" have shown that the effect is\nindependent of frequency pointing to an axionic hair interpretation for the\neffect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 14:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-02"}

The analogous problem with quantum circuits (QED) is to determine which\ncircuit produces the state with greater von Neumann entropy, when acting on a\nfixed input state and after tracing out part of the output. Based on plausible\ncomplexity-theoretic assumptions, both of these problems are believed to be\nintractable for polynomial-time quantum computation. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the hardness of these problems in the case where the input circuits\nhave logarithmic and constant depth, respectively. We show that, relative to an\noracle, these problems cannot be as hard as their counterparts with\npolynomial-size circuits. Furthermore, we show that if a certain type of\nreduction from QED to the log-depth version exists, it implies that any\npolynomial-time quantum computation can be performed in log depth. While this\nsuggests that having shallow circuits makes entropy estimation easier, we give\nindication that the problem remains intractable for polynomial-time quantum\ncomputation by proving a reduction from Learning-With-Errors (LWE) to\nconstant-depth ED.

Using symmetric zero-sum matrix games, we demonstrate formally that\nalliance formation may be seen as a social dilemma, and empirically that\nna\\\"ive multi-agent reinforcement learning therefore fails to form alliances.\nWe introduce a toy model of economic competition, and show how reinforcement\nlearning may be augmented with a peer-to-peer contract mechanism to discover\nand enforce alliances. Finally, we generalize our agent model to incorporate\ntemporally-extended contracts, presenting opportunities for further work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 10:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

A\nrange of models, from the simple harmonic oscillator to the successful\nPeyrard-Bishop-Dauxois (PBD) type models of DNA, lead to characteristic\nuniversal behavior: formation of domains of dissociation in the driving force\namplitude-frequency space, characterized by the presence of local boundary\nminima. We demonstrate, that by simply following the progression of the\nresonance maxima in this space, while gradually increasing intensity of the\nradiation one must necessarily arrive at one of these minima, i.e. a point\nwhere the ultra-high spectral selectivity is retained. We show that this\nuniversal property, applicable to other oscillatory system, is a consequence of\nthe fact that these models belong to the fold catastrophe universality class of\nthe catastrophe theory. This in turn implies that for most bio-structures,\nincluding DNA, a high spectral sensitivity near the onset of the denaturation\nprocesses can be expected. Such spectrally selective molecular denaturation\ncould find important applications in biology and medicine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 20:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

In this work we focus on the development of a\nstate-of-the-art artificial intelligence model for Anomaly Detection named\nMLography to automatically quantify the degree of anomaly of impurities in\nalloys. For this purpose, we introduce several anomaly detection measures:\nSpatial, Shape and Area anomaly, that successfully detect the most anomalous\nobjects based on their objective, given that the impurities were already\nlabeled. The first two measures quantify the degree of anomaly of each object\nby how each object is distant and big compared to its neighborhood, and by the\nabnormally of its own shape respectively. The last measure, combines the former\ntwo and highlights the most anomalous regions among all input images, for later\n(physical) examination. The performance of the model is presented and analyzed\nbased on few representative cases. We stress that although the models presented\nhere were developed for metallography analysis, most of them can be generalized\nto a wider set of problems in which anomaly detection of geometrical objects is\ndesired.

Advanced energy analytics applications-including fault detection\nand diagnostics and supervisory control-have emerged as a significant\nopportunity for improving the performance of our built environment. Effective\napplication of these analytics depends on harnessing structured data from the\nvarious building control and monitoring systems, but typical Building\nAutomation System implementations do not employ any standardized metadata\nschema. While standards such as Project Haystack and Brick Schema have been\ndeveloped to address this issue, the process of structuring the data, i.e.,\ntagging the points to apply a standard metadata schema, has, to date, been a\nmanual process. This process is typically costly, labor-intensive, and\nerror-prone. In this work we address this gap by proposing a UA that automates\nthe process of point tagging by leveraging the data accessible through\nconnection to the BAS, including time series data and the raw point names. The\nUA intertwines supervised classification and unsupervised clustering techniques\nfrom machine learning and leverages both their deterministic and probabilistic\noutputs to inform the point tagging process. Furthermore, we extend the UA to\nembed additional input and output data-processing modules that are designed to\naddress the challenges associated with the real-time deployment of this\nautomation solution. We test the UA on two datasets for real-life buildings: 1.\ncommercial retail buildings and 2. office buildings from the National Renewable\nEnergy Laboratory campus.

The bulk stress in Sn coatings was\nmeasured using a laser-optics based curvature setup, whereas glancing angle\nX-ray diffraction was employed to quantify the surface stress; this also\nallowed studying role of out-of-plane stress gradient in whisker growth. Both\nbulk stress and surface stress in Sn coating evolved with time, wherein both\nwere compressive immediately after the deposition, and thereafter while the\nbulk stress monotonically became more compressive and subsequently saturated\nwith aging at room temperature, the stress near the surface of the Sn coating\ncontinually became more tensile with aging. These opposing evolutionary\nbehaviors of bulk and surface stresses readily established a negative\nout-of-plane stress gradient, required for spontaneous growth of whiskers. The\nimportance of out-of-plane stress gradient was also validated by externally\nimposing widely different stress states and stress gradients in Sn coatings\nusing a 3-point bending apparatus. It was consistently observed that whisker\ngrowth was more in the coatings under external tensile stress, however, with\nhigher negative out-of-plane stress gradient. The results conclusively indicate\nthe critical role of negative out-of-plane stress gradient on whisker growth,\nas compared to only the nature (i.e., sign and magnitude) of stress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 22:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}
