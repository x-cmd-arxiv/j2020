Empirically, this has been shown to produce\nspeaker-discriminative embeddings, even for unseen speakers. However, it is not\nclear that this is the optimal means of training embeddings that generalize\nwell. This work proposes two approaches to learning embeddings, based on the\nnotion of dropping classes during training. We demonstrate that both approaches\ncan yield performance gains in speaker verification tasks. The first proposed\nmethod, DropClass, works via periodically dropping a random subset of classes\nfrom the training data and the output layer throughout training, resulting in a\nfeature extractor trained on many different classification tasks. Combined with\nan additive angular margin loss, this method can yield a 7.9% relative\nimprovement in equal error rate (EER) over a strong baseline on VoxCeleb. The\nsecond proposed method, DropAdapt, is a means of adapting a trained model to a\nset of enrolment speakers in an unsupervised manner. This is performed by\nfine-tuning a model on only those classes which produce high probability\npredictions when the enrolment speakers are used as input, again also dropping\nthe relevant rows from the output layer.

SEA starts by\nusing a baseline (or production) ranking system (i.e., policy), which does not\nharm the user experience and, thus, is safe to execute, but has suboptimal\nperformance and, thus, needs to be improved. Then SEA uses counterfactual\nlearning to learn a new policy based on the behavior of the baseline policy.\nSEA also uses high-confidence off-policy evaluation to estimate the performance\nof the newly learned policy. Once the performance of the newly learned policy\nis at least as good as the performance of the baseline policy, SEA starts using\nthe new policy to execute new actions, allowing it to actively explore\nfavorable regions of the action space. This way, SEA never performs worse than\nthe baseline policy and, thus, does not harm the user experience, while still\nexploring the action space and, thus, being able to find an optimal policy. Our\nexperiments using text classification and document retrieval confirm the above\nby comparing SEA (and a boundless variant called BSEA) to online and offline\nlearning methods for contextual bandit problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2020 19:18:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-06"}

One major challenge commonly facing\nthese architectures is the difficulty of handling bursty traffic with optical\ncircuit switches (OCS) with high switching latency. Prior works generally rely\non fast-switching OCS prototypes to better react to traffic changes via\nfrequent reconfigurations. This approach, unfortunately, adds further\ncomplexity to the control plane. We propose METTEOR, an easily deployable\nsolution for optical circuit switched data centers, that is designed for the\ncurrent capabilities of commercial OCSs. Using multiple predicted traffic\nmatrices, METTEOR designs data center topologies that are less sensitive to\ntraffic changes, thus eliminating the need of frequently reconfiguring OCSs\nupon traffic changes. Results based on extensive evaluations using production\ntraces show that METTEOR increases the percentage of direct-hop traffic by\nabout 80% over a fat tree at comparable cost, and by about 30% over a uniform\nmesh, at comparable maximum link utilizations.

They are\nparticularly important for biological reactions, where the reaction rates are\noften determined by the diffusive transport of the molecules on two-dimensional\nsurfaces, such as the cell membrane. The peculiarities of diffusion on\ntwo-dimensional surfaces may lead to nontrivial reaction kinetics, such as\nconcentration dependent rate of association between two molecules. However,\ntraditionally, the kinetics of biomolecular association reactions has been\nmodeled using the law of mass action, which assumes that the rate of reaction\nis a concentration independent constant. In this paper, using multiscale\nmolecular simulation, we investigate the concentration dependence of\ndiffusion-limited association reactions on 2D surfaces. In particular, we\nquantify the influence of short-ranged pair interactions on the concentration\ndependence of the reaction rates and codify it in an empirical law. Using this\nlaw in a chemical kinetic model, we find that the the steady state behaviors of\nsimple chemical systems are drastically modified by the presence of\nconcentration dependent rates. In particular, we find that it leads to\nsuppression of intrinsic noise in dimerization reaction and destabilizes robust\noscillation in Lotka-Volterra predator-prey systems. In fact, we see a\ntransition from robust to fine-tuned behavior in the latter. In addition, we\nshow that concentration dependent reaction rates arise naturally in stochastic\npredator-prey systems due to intrinsic noise. We comment on the consequences of\nthese results and discuss their implications in the modeling of complex\nchemical and biological systems.

Resonators with a large intrinsic quality factor (Q) are highly\ndesirable since they can store a large amount of energy, leading to sharp\nfiltering and low loss. Exciting high-Q cavities with monochromatic signals,\nhowever, suffers from poor excitation efficiency, i.e., most of the impinging\nenergy is lost in the form of reflection, since high-Q resonators are weakly\ncoupled to external radiation. Although critical coupling eliminates\nreflections in steady-state by matching the intrinsic and coupling decay rates,\nthis approach requires the introduction of loss in the resonator, causing\ndissipation and lowering the overall Q-factor. Here, we extend the notion of\ncritical coupling to high-Q lossless resonators based on tailoring the temporal\nprofile of the excitation wave. Utilizing coupled-mode theory, we demonstrate\nan effect analogous to critical coupling by mimicking loss with\nnon-monochromatic excitations at complex frequencies.

Our results point out, first, that\nthe metrics do not rank the degree of nestedness of networks universally.\nFurthermore, several metrics show significant undesired dependencies on the\nnetwork properties considered. The study of these dependencies allows us to\nunderstand some of the systematic shifts between the real values of nestedness\nand the average over the null model. This paper intends to provide readers with\na critical guide on how to measure nestedness patterns, by explaining the\nfunctioning of six standard metrics and two of its variants, and then\ndisclosing its qualities and flaws. By doing so, we also aim to extend the\napplication of the recently proposed null models based on maximum entropy to\nthe still largely unexplored area of ecological networks. Finally, to\ncomplement the guide, we provide a fully-documented repository named nullnest\nwhich gathers the codes to produce the null model and calculate the nestedness\nindex -- both the real value and the null expectation -- using the studied\nmetrics. The repository contains, moreover, the main results of the null model\napplied to a large dataset of more than 200 bipartite networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 02:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

For conjunctions, there there exists a\n\"rule-of-thumb\" of evaluating predicates in increasing selectivity to minimize\nunnecessary predicate evaluations. However, for disjunctions, no such\nrule-of-thumb exists. Furthermore, what little past work there is, has mostly\nfocused on optimizations for traditional row-oriented databases. A key\ndifference in predicate evaluation for row stores and column stores is that\nwhile row stores apply predicates to a single record at a time, column stores\napply predicates to sets of records. Not only must the execution engine decide\nthe order in which to apply the predicates, but it must also decide how to\ncombine these sets to minimize the total number of records these predicates are\napplied to. Our goal for this work is to provide a good \"rule-of-thumb\"\nalgorithm for queries with both conjunctions and disjunctions in a column store\nsetting. We present EvalPred, the first polynomial-time (i.e., O(n log n))\npredicate evaluation algorithm with provably optimal guarantees for all\npredicate expressions of nested depth 2 or less. EvalPred's optimality is\nguaranteed under a wide range of cost models, representing different real-world\nscenarios, as long as the cost model follows a \"triangle-inequality\"-like\nproperty. Yet, despite its powerful guarantees, EvalPred is almost trivially\nsimple and should be easy to implement, even in existing systems. Even for\npredicate expressions of depth 3 or greater, we show via experimentation that\nEvalPred comes quite close to optimal with 92% of queries within 5% of optimal.\nFurthermore, compared to other algorithms, EvalPred achieves average speedups\nof 2.6x over no disjunction optimization, 1.4x over a greedy algorithm, and 28x\nover the state-of-the-art for the top 10% of queries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 02:35:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 14:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

The key idea is to cast the conventional deep\nneural network (DNN) based vector-to-vector regression formulation under a\ntensor-train network (TTN) framework. TTN is a recently emerged solution for\ncompact representation of deep models with fully connected hidden layers. Thus\nTTN maintains DNN's expressive power yet involves a much smaller amount of\ntrainable parameters. Furthermore, TTN can handle a multi-dimensional tensor\ninput by design, which exactly matches the desired setting in multi-channel\nspeech enhancement. We first provide a theoretical extension from DNN to TTN\nbased regression. Next, we show that TTN can attain speech enhancement quality\ncomparable with that for DNN but with much fewer parameters, e.g., a reduction\nfrom 27 million to only 5 million parameters is observed in a single-channel\nscenario. TTN also improves PESQ over DNN from 2.86 to 2.96 by slightly\nincreasing the number of trainable parameters. Finally, in 8-channel\nconditions, a PESQ of 3.12 is achieved using 20 million parameters for TTN,\nwhereas a DNN with 68 million parameters can only attain a PESQ of 3.06.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nDecomposable Winograd Method (DWM), which breaks through the limitation of\noriginal Winograd's minimal filtering algorithm to a wide and general\nconvolutions. DWM decomposes kernels with large size or large stride to several\nsmall kernels with stride as 1 for further applying Winograd method, so that\nDWM can reduce the number of multiplications while keeping the numerical\naccuracy. It enables the fast exploring of larger kernel size and larger stride\nvalue in CNNs for high performance and accuracy and even the potential for new\nCNNs.

To study the effects of\nsymmetry energy on the properties of neutron stars, an $\\omega$ meson and\n$\\rho$ meson coupling term is included in a popular RMF Lagrangian, i.e. the\nTM1 parameter set, which is used for the widely used supernova equation of\nstate (EoS) table. The coupling constants relevant to the vector-isovector\nmeson, $\\rho$, are refitted by a fixed symmetry energy at subsaturation density\nand its slope at saturation density, while other coupling constants remain the\nsame as the original ones in TM1 so as to update the supernova EoS table. The\nradius and mass of maximum neutron stars are not so sensitive to the symmetry\nenergy in these family TM1 parameterizations. However, the radii at\nintermediate mass region are strongly correlated with the slope of symmetry\nenergy. Furthermore, the dimensionless tidal deformabilities of neutron stars\nare also calculated within the associated Love number. We find that its value\nat $1.4 M_\\odot$ has a linear correlation to the slope of symmetry energy being\ndifferent from the previous studied. With the latest constraints of tidal\ndeformabilities from GW170817 event, the slope of symmetry energy at nuclear\nsaturation density should be smaller than $60$ MeV in the family TM1\nparameterizations. This fact supports the usage of lower symmetry energy slope\nfor the update supernova EoS, which is applicable to simulations of neutron\nstar merger. Furthermore, the analogous analysis are also done within the\nfamily IUFSU parameter sets. It is found that the correlations between the\nsymmetry energy slope with the radius and tidal deformability at $1.4 M_\\odot$\nhave very similar linear relations in these RMF models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 05:20:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

Furthermore, in\norder to train the model on the complex dataset effectively, we propose a\nmulti-curriculum learning method. Experiments show that our method outperforms\nprevious methods on 8 datasets by a large margin with the zero-shot test\nsetting, demonstrating the excellent generalization capacity of the learned\nmodel to diverse scenes. The reconstructed point clouds with the predicted\ndepth show that our method can recover high-quality 3D shapes.

Recent\nadversarial training based domain adaptation methods have shown their\neffectiveness on minimizing domain discrepancy via marginal feature\ndistributions alignment. However, aligning the marginal feature distributions\ndoes not guarantee the alignment of class conditional distributions. This\nlimitation is more evident when adapting object detectors as the domain\ndiscrepancy is larger compared to the image classification task, e.g. various\nnumber of objects exist in one image and the majority of content in an image is\nthe background. This motivates us to learn domain invariance for category level\nsemantics via gradient alignment. Intuitively, if the gradients of two domains\npoint in similar directions, then the learning of one domain can improve that\nof another domain. To achieve gradient alignment, we propose Forward-Backward\nCyclic Adaptation, which iteratively computes adaptation from source to target\nvia backward hopping and from target to source via forward passing.

As a solution strategy, we demonstrate that the power control and time\nallocation, and scheduling problems can be solved separately in the optimal\nsolution. For the power control and time allocation problem, we derive the\noptimal solution by using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. For the scheduling, we\nintroduce a penalty function allowing reformulation as a sum penalty\nminimization problem. Upon derivation of the optimality conditions based on the\ncharacteristics of the penalty function, we propose two polynomial-time\nheuristic algorithms and a reduced-complexity exact algorithm employing smart\npruning techniques.

As many\nelectron materials show unusual many-body correlations, the technique to detect\ndirectly these many-body correlations will play important roles in the study of\ntheir many-body physics. In this article, we propose a technique to detect\ndirectly the two-particle correlations, a coincidence ARPES (cARPES) where two\nincident photons excite two respective photoelectrons which are detected in\ncoincidence. While the one-photon-absorption and one-photoelectron-emission\nARPES provides the single-particle spectrum function, the proposed cARPES with\ntwo-photon absorption and two-photoelectron emission is relevant to a\ntwo-particle Bethe-Salpeter wave function. Examples of the coincidence\ndetection probability of the cARPES for a free Fermi gas and a\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting state are studied in detail. We\nalso propose another two experimental techniques, a coincidence angle-resolved\nphotoemission and inverse-photoemission spectroscopy (cARP/IPES) and a\ncoincidence angle-resolved inverse-photoemission spectroscopy (cARIPES). As all\nof these proposed coincidence techniques can provide the two-particle frequency\nBethe-Salpeter wave functions, they can show the momentum and energy dependent\ntwo-particle dynamical physics of the material electrons in the\nparticle-particle or particle-hole channel. Thus, they can be introduced to\nstudy the Cooper-pair physics in the superconductor, the itinerant magnetism in\nthe metallic ferromagnet/antiferromagnet, and the particle-hole pair physics in\nthe metallic nematic state. Moreover, as the two-particle Bethe-Salpeter wave\nfunctions also involve the inner-pair dynamical physics, these proposed\ncoincidence techniques can be used to study the inner-pair time-retarded\nphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 08:59:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2020 17:30:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 02:20:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 12:09:56 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 12:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

This is a basic primitive in\nvarious problems in bioinformatics, graph databases, or networks. The hardness\nresults of Backurs and Indyk (FOCS 2016) imply that this problem cannot be\nsolved in better than $O(|E||P|)$ time, under the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis\n(OVH), and this holds even under various restrictions on the graph (Equi et\nal., ICALP 2019).\n  In this paper we consider its offline version, namely the one in which we are\nallowed to index the graph in order to support time-efficient string matching\nqueries. Indeed, it was tantalizing in the string matching community to believe\nthat sub-quadratic time queries can be achieved, e.g. at the cost of a\nhigh-degree polynomial-time indexing.\n  We disprove this belief, showing that, under OVH, no polynomial-time index\ncan support querying $P$ in time $O(|E|^\\delta|P|^\\beta)$, with either $\\delta\n< 1$ or $\\beta < 1$.

We found that existing parameter servers\nprovide only limited support for PAL techniques, however, and therefore prevent\nefficient training. In this paper, we explore whether and to what extent PAL\ntechniques can be supported, and whether such support is beneficial. We propose\nto integrate dynamic parameter allocation into parameter servers, describe an\nefficient implementation of such a parameter server called Lapse, and\nexperimentally compare its performance to existing parameter servers across a\nnumber of machine learning tasks. We found that Lapse provides near-linear\nscaling and can be orders of magnitude faster than existing parameter servers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 11:37:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 14:05:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 12:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-06"}

The physical mechanisms that heat this intracluster\nmedium (ICM) to such temperatures include the accretion shock at the periphery\nof a galaxy cluster, the shocks driven by merger events, as well as a somewhat\noverlooked mechanism -- the dissipation of intracluster turbulent motions. We\nstudy the relative role of these heating mechanisms using galaxy clusters in\nLagrangian tracer particle re-simulations of the Omega500 cosmological\nsimulation. We adopt a novel analysis method of decomposing the temperature\nincrease at each time step into the contribution from dissipative heating and\nthat from adiabatic heating. In the high-resolution spatial-temporal map of\nthese heating rates, merger tracks are clearly visible, demonstrating the\ndominant role of merger events in heating the ICM. The dissipative heating\ncontributed by each merger event is extended in time and also occurs in the\nrarefaction regions, suggesting the importance of heating by the dissipation of\nmerger-induced turbulence. Quantitative analysis shows that turbulence heating,\nrather than direct heating at merger shocks, dominates the temperature increase\nof the ICM, especially at inner radii $r < r_{\\rm 500c}$. In addition, we find\nthat many merger shocks can propagate with almost constant velocity to very\nlarge radii $r \\gg r_{\\rm 500c}$, some even reach and join with the accretion\nshock and becoming the outer boundary of the ICM. Altogether, these results\nsuggest that the ICM is heated more in an `inside-out' fashion rather than\n`outside-in' as depicted in the classical smooth accretion picture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 12:31:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 03:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

It is\nexpected that eigenstates in the metallic or ergodic phase, behave as random\nstates and hence the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix, commonly\nreferred to as the entanglement spectrum, are expected to follow the eigenvalue\nstatistics of a trace normalized Wishart ensemble. In particular, the density\nof eigenvalues is supposed to follow the universal Marchenko-Pastur\ndistribution. We find deviations in the tails both for the disordered XXZ with\ntotal $S_z$ conserved in the half-filled sector as well as in a model that\nbreaks this conservation. A sensitive measure of deviations is provided by the\nlargest eigenvalue, which in the case of the Wishart ensemble after appropriate\nshift and scaling follows the universal Tracy-Widom distribution.

We\ntherefore encourage use of this tool to prioritize follow-up observations that\nconfirm bona fide planets and identify false positives originating from nearby\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 12:59:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 06:04:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

An important property of IGML is that solution optimality is\nguaranteed because the problem is formulated as a convex problem and our\npruning strategies only discard unnecessary subgraphs. Furthermore, we show\nthat IGML is also applicable to other structured data such as itemset and\nsequence data, and that it can incorporate vertex-label similarity by using a\ntransportation-based subgraph feature.

The concept of balance in signed graph\ntheory determines whether a network can be partitioned into two perfectly\nopposing subsets, and is therefore useful for modelling phenomena such as the\nexistence of polarized communities in social networks. While determining\nwhether a graph is balanced is easy, finding a large balanced subgraph is hard.\nThe few heuristics available in the literature for this purpose are either\nineffective or non-scalable.

Here we study the\nalignment of rods with the Lagrangian stretching direction in a channel flow,\nwhich is approximately homogeneous and isotropic near the center but\ninhomogeneous and anisotropic near the walls. Our main question is how the\ndistribution of relative angles between a rod and the Lagrangian stretching\ndirection depends on the aspect ratio of the rod and upon the distance of the\nrod from the channel wall.

A key ingredient was information about\ncertain Kronecker coefficients. While tensors are an interesting test bed for\nGCT ideas, the far-away goal is the separation of algebraic complexity classes.\nThe role of the Kronecker coefficients in that setting is taken by the\nso-called plethysm coefficients: These are the multiplicities in the coordinate\nrings of spaces of polynomials. Even though several hardness results for\nKronecker coefficients are known, there are almost no results about the\ncomplexity of computing the plethysm coefficients or even deciding their\npositivity.\n  In this paper we show that deciding positivity of plethysm coefficients is\nNP-hard, and that computing plethysm coefficients is #P-hard. In fact, both\nproblems remain hard even if the inner parameter of the plethysm coefficient is\nfixed. In this way we obtain an inner versus outer contrast: If the outer\nparameter of the plethysm coefficient is fixed, then the plethysm coefficient\ncan be computed in polynomial time.\n  Moreover, we derive new lower and upper bounds and in special cases even\ncombinatorial descriptions for plethysm coefficients, which we consider to be\nof independent interest.

Using cryptographic\ntechniques, it is possible to perform inference tasks remotely on sensitive\nclient data in a privacy-preserving way: the server learns nothing about the\ninput data and the model predictions, while the client learns nothing about the\nML model (which is often considered intellectual property and might contain\ntraces of sensitive data). While such privacy-preserving solutions are\nrelatively efficient, they are mostly targeted at neural networks, can degrade\nthe predictive accuracy, and usually reveal the network's topology.\nFurthermore, existing solutions are not readily accessible to ML experts, as\nprototype implementations are not well-integrated into ML frameworks and\nrequire extensive cryptographic knowledge.\n  In this paper, we present CryptoSPN, a framework for privacy-preserving\ninference of sum-product networks (SPNs).

Learning an appropriate feature space and identifying\nsuitable archetypes simultaneously addresses this problem. This paper\nintroduces a generative formulation of the linear archetype model,\nparameterized by neural networks. By introducing the distance-dependent\narchetype loss, the linear archetype model can be integrated into the latent\nspace of a variational autoencoder, and an optimal representation with respect\nto the unknown archetypes can be learned end-to-end.

Despite the simulations spanning very different\nwave breaking conditions (including an extreme case with violently plunging\nwaves on an effectively dry reef slope), the model was able to reproduce a wide\nrange of relevant surf zone hydrodynamic processes using a fixed set of\nnumerical parameters. This included accurate predictions of the nonlinear\nevolution of wave shapes (e.g., asymmetry and skewness properties), rates of\nwave dissipation within the surf zone, and wave setup distributions.

After proposing\neight ethical desiderata points for F-RS, we present a case-study and assess it\nbased on our proposed desiderata points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 00:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-14"}

By introducing\nparallel structures of Legendre transformations, other thermodynamic equations\nwith dual interpretations of quantities are also deduced in the open systems,\nand then several dual thermodynamic relations are inferred.

We show that a\nstandard neuron followed by the novel apical dendrite activation (ADA) can\nlearn the XOR logical function with 100\\% accuracy. Furthermore, we conduct\nexperiments on five benchmark data sets from computer vision, signal processing\nand natural language processing, i.e. MOROCO, UTKFace, CREMA-D, Fashion-MNIST,\nand Tiny ImageNet, showing that ADA and the leaky ADA functions provide\nsuperior results to Rectified Linear Units (ReLU), leaky ReLU, RBF and Swish,\nfor various neural network architectures, e.g. one-hidden-layer or\ntwo-hidden-layer multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) such as LeNet, VGG, ResNet and Character-level CNN.
