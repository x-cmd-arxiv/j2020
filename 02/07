By successfully imitating a thinking entity such as a human, this\nmachine then proves that it can also think. Some objections claim that Turing\ntest is not a tool to demonstrate the existence of general intelligence or\nthinking activity. A compelling alternative is the Lovelace test, in which the\nagent must originate a product that the agent's creator cannot explain.\nTherefore, the agent must be the owner of an original product. However, for\nthis to happen the agent must exhibit the idea of self and distinguish oneself\nfrom others. Sustaining the idea of self within the Turing test is still\npossible if the judge decides to act as a textual mirror. Self-recognition\ntests applied on animals through mirrors appear to be viable tools to\ndemonstrate the existence of a type of general intelligence.

By tuning the visual system to relevant information sources,\nobject recognition can become more efficient (a benefit) and more biased toward\nthe target (a potential cost). Motivated by selective attention in\ncategorisation models, we developed a goal-directed attention mechanism that\ncan process naturalistic (photographic) stimuli. Our attention mechanism can be\nincorporated into any existing deep convolutional neural network (DCNNs). The\nprocessing stages in DCNNs have been related to ventral visual stream. In that\nlight, our attentional mechanism incorporates top-down influences from\nprefrontal cortex (PFC) to support goal-directed behaviour. Akin to how\nattention weights in categorisation models warp representational spaces, we\nintroduce a layer of attention weights to the mid-level of a DCNN that amplify\nor attenuate activity to further a goal. We evaluated the attentional mechanism\nusing photographic stimuli, varying the attentional target. We found that\nincreasing goal-directed attention has benefits (increasing hit rates) and\ncosts (increasing false alarm rates). At a moderate level, attention improves\nsensitivity (i.e., increases $d^\\prime$) at only a moderate increase in bias\nfor tasks involving standard images, blended images, and natural adversarial\nimages chosen to fool DCNNs. These results suggest that goal-directed attention\ncan reconfigure general-purpose DCNNs to better suit the current task goal,\nmuch like PFC modulates activity along the ventral stream.

Value of information (VoI)\nanalysis is a mathematical decision framework that quantifies expected\npotential benefits of new data and assists with optimal allocation of resources\nfor information collection. However, analysis of VoI is computational very\ncostly because of the underlying Bayesian inference especially for\nequality-type information.

Instead of modeling the limit state functions\ndescribing events of interest for decision making, which is commonly pursued in\nsurrogate model-based reliability methods, the proposed framework models system\nresponses. This approach affords sharing equality-type information from\nobservations among surrogate models to update likelihoods of multiple events of\ninterest. Moreover, two knowledge sharing schemes called model and training\npoints sharing are proposed to most effectively take advantage of the knowledge\noffered by costly model evaluations.

This paper also\npresents a novel insight particularly on QIB function set: any function that is\nQIB turns out to be also Lipschitz continuous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 17:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-07"}

A remarkable\noptoelectronic technique that has experimented a strong development in the last\nfew years is the so called photovoltaic optoelectronic tweezers.

The technique is simple and versatile,\nenabling a successful manipulation of a large variety of micro- and\nnano-objects with only optical control, without the need of electrodes or power\nsupplies.

In this\nsingular configuration, the high electric fields generated in the photovoltaic\nsubstrate allow a simple and flexible manipulation of aqueous droplets\ncontrolled by the light.

The\ncomplex interplay between ice, meltwater, and till at the subglacial bed\nconnects several fundamental problems in glaciology including the debate about\nrapid mass loss from the ice sheets, the formation and evolution of subglacial\nlandforms, and the storage and transport of subglacial water. In-situ\nmeasurements have probed the subglacial bed, but provide surprisingly variable\nand seemingly inconsistent evidence of the depth where deformation occurs, even\nat a given field site. These observations suggest that subglacial beds are\ninherently dynamic. The goal of this paper is to advance our understanding of\nthe physical processes that contribute to the dynamics of subglacial beds as\nreflected in existing observations of basal deformation. We build on recent\nadvances in modeling dense, granular flows to derive a new numerical model for\nwater-saturated till. Our model demonstrates that changes in the force balance\nor temporal variations in water pressure can shift slip away from the ice-bed\ninterface and far into the bed, causing episodes of significantly enhanced till\ntransport because the entire till layer above the deep slip interface becomes\nmobilized.

Such a\ngeometrical frustration gives rise to large elastic stresses, which render the\ncrystal unstable when its size is significantly larger than the typical lattice\nspacing. Depending on the compliance of the crystal with respect to stretching\nand bending deformations, these stresses are alleviated by either a local\nincrease of the intrinsic curvature in proximity of the disclinations or by the\nproliferation of excess dislocations, often organized in the form of\none-dimensional chains known as \"scars\". The associated strain field of the\nscars is such to counterbalance the one resulting from the isolated\ndisclinations. Here, we develop a continuum theory of dislocation screening in\ntwo-dimensional closed crystals with genus one. Upon modeling the flux of scars\nemanating from a given disclination as an independent scalar field, we\ndemonstrate that the elastic energy of closed two-dimensional crystals with\nvarious degrees of asphericity can be expressed as a simple quadratic function\nof the screened topological charge of the disclinations, both at zero and\nfinite temperature.

Two key AGN feedback models are (1)\nradiation pressure accelerating cool gas and (2) a hot outflowing wind\nentraining the ISM. Highly ionized emission-line diagnostics represent a\npowerful means of differentiating these scenarios because of their sensitivity\nto the expected compression of the ISM clouds by the hot wind. Here, we report\nthe first spatially resolved UV emission spectroscopy of a prototypical\n(radio-quiet) quasar-driven superwind around the obscured quasar SDSSJ1356+1026\nat z=0.123.

Such similarity is expected for clouds with AGN radiation pressure\ndominated dynamics. Comparing the observed line emission to models of clouds in\nbalance with radiation pressure and/or a hot wind, we rule out the presence of\na dynamically important hot wind and constrain the ratio of hot gas pressure to\nradiation pressure to P_hot/P_rad<0.25 both at <100 pc and ~10 kpc from the\nnucleus. Moreover, the predictions of the radiation pressure confined cloud\nmodels that best fit observed UV line ratios are consistent with the observed\ndiffuse X-ray spectrum.

This can be explained as an\nevaporation valley between planets with and without H/He that is caused by\natmospheric escape. First, we conduct numerical simulations of the evolution of\nclose-in low-mass planets with H/He undergoing escape. Second, we develop an\nanalytical model for the valley locus. We find that the bottom of the valley\nquantified by the radius of the largest stripped core $R_{\\rm b}$ at a given\norbital distance depends only weakly on post-formation H/He mass. The reason is\nthat a high initial H/He mass means that there is more gas to evaporate, but\nalso that the planet density is lower, increasing loss. Regarding stellar\n$L_{\\rm XUV}$, $R_{\\rm b}$ scales as $L_{\\rm XUV}^{0.135}$. The same weak\ndependency applies to the efficiency factor $\\varepsilon$ of energy-limited\nevaporation. As found numerically and analytically, $R_{\\rm b}$ varies as\nfunction of orbital period $P$ for a constant $\\varepsilon$ as $P^{-2 p_{\\rm\nc}/3}\\approx P^{-0.18}$ where $M \\propto R^{p_{\\rm c}}$ is the mass-radius\nrelation of solid cores. $R_{\\rm b}$ is about 1.7 $R_{\\oplus}$ at a 10-day\norbit for an Earth-like composition, increasing linearly with ice mass\nfraction. The numerical results are explained very well with the analytical\nmodel where complete evaporation occurs if the temporal integral over the\nstellar XUV irradiation absorbed by the planet is larger than binding energy of\nthe envelope in the gravitational potential of the core. The weak dependency on\nprimordial H/He mass, $L_{\\rm XUV}$ and $\\varepsilon$ explains why\nobservationally the valley is visible, and why theoretically models find\nsimilar results. At the same time, given the large observed spread of $L_{\\rm\nXUV}$, the dependency on it is still strong enough to explain why the valley is\nnot completely empty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

With CRs\ninjected in supernovae as modeled here, the low-pressure halo allows \"escape\"\nand CR pressure gradients continuously accelerate this material well into the\nIGM in \"fast\" outflows, while lower-density gas at large radii is accelerated\nin-situ into \"slow\" outflows that extend to $>$Mpc scales.

Nonparameteric methods such as the popular\nk-nearest neighbors (KNN) are slow converging for discrete processes, and thus\ndata hungry. Now, with the new multi-variate Poisson estimator developed here\nas the core computational engine, the causation entropy (CSE) principle,\ntogether with the associated greedy search algorithm optimal CSE (oCSE) allows\nus to efficiently infer the true network structure for this class of stochastic\nprocesses that were previously not practical. We illustrate the power of our\nmethod, first in benchmarking with synthetic datum, and then by inferring the\ngenetic factors network from a breast cancer micro-RNA (miRNA) sequence count\ndata set. We show the Poisson oCSE gives the best performance among the tested\nmethods anfmatlabd discovers previously known interactions on the breast cancer\ndata set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 19:20:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 21:32:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-12"}

If transit agencies hope to\nreverse this trend, they must understand how their service allocation policies\naffect ridership. This paper is among the first to model ridership trends on a\nhyper-local level over time. A Poisson fixed-effects model is developed to\nevaluate the ridership elasticity to frequency on weekdays using passenger\ncount data from Portland, Miami, Minneapolis/St-Paul, and Atlanta between 2012\nand 2018. In every agency, ridership is found to be elastic to frequency when\nobserving the variation between individual route-segments at one point in time.\nIn other words, the most frequent routes are already the most productive in\nterms of passengers per vehicle-trip. When observing the variation within each\nroute-segment over time, however, ridership is inelastic; each additional\nvehicle-trip is expected to generate less ridership than the average bus\nalready on the route. In three of the four agencies, the elasticity is a\ndecreasing function of prior frequency, meaning that low-frequency routes are\nthe most sensitive to changes in frequency. This paper can help transit\nagencies anticipate the marginal effect of shifting service throughout the\nnetwork. As the quality and availability of passenger count data improve, this\npaper can serve as the methodological basis to explore the dynamics of bus\nridership.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 19:57:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 19:26:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 22:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

An internal representation, however, is judged by its\ncontribution to performance on a given task, and may thus vary between\ndifferent types of navigation tasks. Here we train a recurrent neural network\nthat controls an agent performing several navigation tasks in a simple\nenvironment. To focus on internal representations, we split learning into a\ntask-agnostic pre-training stage that modifies internal connectivity and a\ntask-specific Q learning stage that controls the network's output. We show that\npre-training shapes the attractor landscape of the networks, leading to either\na continuous attractor, discrete attractors or a disordered state. These\nstructures induce bias onto the Q-Learning phase, leading to a performance\npattern across the tasks corresponding to metric and topological regularities.\nBy combining two types of networks in a modular structure, we could get better\nperformance for both regularities. Our results show that, in recurrent\nnetworks, inductive bias takes the form of attractor landscapes -- which can be\nshaped by pre-training and analyzed using dynamical systems methods.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that non-metric representations are useful for\nnavigation tasks, and their combination with metric representation leads to\nflexibile multiple-task learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 20:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-10"}

The fate of a massive star during the latest stages of its evolution\nis highly dependent on its mass-loss rate/geometry and therefore knowing the\ngeometry of the circumstellar material close to the star and its surroundings\nis crucial. Aims. We aim to study the nature (i.e. geometry, rates) of\nmass-loss episodes. In this context, yellow hypergiants are great targets.\nMethods. We analyse a large set of optical/near-infrared data, in spectroscopic\nand photometric (X-shooter/VLT), spectropolarimetric (ISIS/WHT), and\ninterferometric GRAVITY-AMBER/VLTI) modes, toward the yellow hypergiant IRAS\n17163-3907. We present the first model-independent reconstructed images of IRAS\n17163-3907 at these wavelengths at milli-arcsecond scales.

The interpretation of the presence of Na i emission at closer\ndistances to the star compared to Br{\\gamma} has been a challenge in various\nstudies. We argue that the presence of a pseudophotosphere is not needed, but\nit is rather an optical depth effect. The three observed distinct mass-loss\nepisodes are characterised by different mass-loss rates and can inform the\ntheories on mass-loss mechanisms, which is a topic still under debate.

A\nfinal coalgebra then gives rise to the coinduction principle, which states that\ntwo bisimilar elements are equal. For polynomial functors, this leads to\nwell-known descriptions. In the present paper we look at the dual notion of\n\"apartness\". Intuitively, two elements are apart if there is a positive way to\ndistinguish them. Phrased differently: two elements are apart if and only if\nthey are not bisimilar. Since apartness is an inductive notion, described by a\nleast fixed point, we can give a proof system, to derive that two elements are\napart. This proof system has derivation rules and two elements are apart if and\nonly if there is a finite derivation (using the rules) of this fact.\n  We study apartness versus bisimulation in two separate ways. First, for weak\nforms of bisimulation on labelled transition systems, where silent (tau) steps\nare included, we define an apartness notion that corresponds to weak\nbisimulation and another apartness that corresponds to branching bisimulation.\nThe rules for apartness can be used to show that two states of a labelled\ntransition system are not branching bismilar. To support the apartness view on\nlabelled transition systems, we cast a number of well-known properties of\nbranching bisimulation in terms of branching apartness and prove them. Next, we\nalso study the more general categorical situation and show that indeed,\napartness is the dual of bisimilarity in a precise categorical sense: apartness\nis an initial algebra and gives rise to an induction principle. In this\nanalogy, we include the powerset functor, which gives a semantics to\nnon-deterministic choice in process-theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 20:58:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 16:23:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 08:02:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 16:46:53 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 12:40:07 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 14:33:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

Interestingly, in\nprotocols with the best overall communication, the demands of the parties are\nhighly unbalanced: the amortized cost is $\\tilde O(1)$ bits per party, but some\nparties must send $\\Omega(n)$ bits. In best known balanced protocols, the\noverall communication is sub-optimal, with each party communicating $\\tilde\nO(\\sqrt{n})$.

Our contributions in this line are as follows:\n  1) We define a cryptographic primitive, succinctly reconstructed distributed\nsignatures (SRDS), that suffices for constructing $\\tilde O(1)$ balanced BA. We\nprovide two constructions of SRDS from different cryptographic and Public-Key\nInfrastructure (PKI) assumptions.\n  2) The SRDS-based BA follows a paradigm of boosting from \"almost-everywhere\"\nagreement to full agreement, and does so in a single round.

To solve these challenges, we propose a novel framework for\nsemi-supervised domain adaptation by unifying the learning of opposite\nstructures (UODA). UODA consists of a generator and two classifiers (i.e., the\nsource-scattering classifier and the target-clustering classifier), which are\ntrained for contradictory purposes. The target-clustering classifier attempts\nto cluster the target features to improve intra-class density and enlarge\ninter-class divergence. Meanwhile, the source-scattering classifier is designed\nto scatter the source features to enhance the decision boundary's smoothness.\nThrough the alternation of source-feature expansion and target-feature\nclustering procedures, the target features are well-enclosed within the dilated\nboundary of the corresponding source features. This strategy can make the\ncross-domain features to be precisely aligned against the source bias\nsimultaneously.

Our first main result is that cartesian differential categories\nare the same as categories with finite products enriched over this skew\nmonoidal base.\n  The comonad $Q$ involved is, in fact, an example of a differential modality.\nDifferential modalities are a kind of comonad on a symmetric monoidal\n$k$-linear category with the characteristic feature that their co-Kleisli\ncategories are cartesian differential categories. Using our first main result,\nwe are able to prove our second one: that every small cartesian differential\ncategory admits a full, structure-preserving embedding into the cartesian\ndifferential category induced by a differential modality (in fact, a monoidal\ndifferential modality on a monoidal closed category -- thus, a model of\nintuitionistic differential linear logic). This resolves an important open\nquestion in this area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 23:30:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 02:08:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-17"}

The NRG analysis of the\ncorresponding Single Impurity Anderson Model (SIAM) shows that the reentrant\nstage is characterized by a second sequence of SIAM fixed points: free orbital\n(FO) > local moment (LM) > strong coupling (SC). In the first stage, the SC\nfixed point (Kondo temperature $T_{K1}$) is unstable, while the second stage\nexhibits a much lower Kondo temperature $T_{K2}$, associated to a stable SC\nfixed point. The results indicate that the reentrant Kondo screening is\nassociated to an effective SIAM, with an effective repulsion $U_{eff}$. This\nlow temperature effective SIAM, which we dub as 'reentrant' SIAM, behaves as a\n'replica' of the high temperature (bare) SIAM.

In each binary system the more massive star is in the\nasymptotic giant branch and its wind is driven by a combination of pulsations\nin the stellar surface layers and radiation pressure on dust, while the less\nmassive star is in the main sequence. Time averages of density and outflow\nvelocity of the stellar wind are calculated and plotted as profiles against\ndistance from the centre of mass and colatitude angle. We find that mass is\nlost mainly through the outer Lagrangian point L2. The resultant outflow\ndevelops into a spiral at low distances from the binary. The outflowing spiral\nis quickly smoothed out by shocks and becomes an excretion disk at larger\ndistances. This leads to the formation of an outflow structure with an\nequatorial density excess, which is greater in binaries with smaller orbital\nseparation. The pole-to-equator density ratio reaches a maximum value of\n$\\sim10^5$ at Roche-Lobe Overflow state. We also find that the gas stream\nleaving L2 does not form a circumbinary ring for stellar mass ratios above\n0.78, when radiation pressure on dust is taken into account. Analytical\nformulae are obtained by curve fitting the 2-dimensional, azimuthally averaged\ndensity and outflow velocity profiles. The formulae can be used in future\nstudies to setup the initial outflow structure in hydrodynamic simulations of\ncommon-envelope evolution and formation of planetary nebulae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 00:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

This strategy efficiently filters out some irrelevant proposals\nand avoids the redundant computation for feature extraction, which enables our\nmethod to operate faster than conventional classification-based tracking\nmethods.

In particular, we propose a novel loss\n(termed the adaptive nearest neighbor loss) based on the classification\nuncertainty to effectively reduce intra-class variations while enlarging\ninter-class differences within the adaptive neighborhood of the sample. The\nproposed loss enables the deep neural network to adaptively learn\ndiscriminative metric embeddings, which significantly improve the\ngeneralization capability of recognizing unseen person identities. Extensive\ncomparative evaluations on challenging person ReID datasets demonstrate the\nsignificantly improved performance of the proposed method compared with several\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 03:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-10"}

To answer the question, we propose a novel resource allocation model\nby considering the awareness of self-protection of individuals. In the model, a\ntuning parameter is introduced to quantify the reaction strength of individuals\nwhen they are aware of the disease. And then, a coupled model of resource\nallocation and disease spreading is proposed to study the impact of\nself-awareness on resource allocation and, its impact on the dynamics of\nepidemic spreading.

The encoder achieves noisy linear\ncompression for jointly sparse signals, with a common measurement matrix. The\nGROUP LASSO-based decoder realizes jointly sparse signal recovery based on an\niterative parallel-coordinate descent (PCD) algorithm which is proposed to\nsolve GROUP LASSO in a parallel manner. In particular, the decoder consists of\nan approximation part which unfolds (several iterations of) the proposed\niterative algorithm to obtain an approximate solution of GROUP LASSO and a\ncorrection part which reduces the difference between the approximate solution\nand the actual jointly sparse signals. The proposed model-driven approach\nachieves higher recovery accuracy with less computation time than the classic\nGROUP LASSO method, and the gain significantly increases in the presence of\nextra structures in sparse patterns. The common measurement matrix obtained by\nthe proposed model-driven approach is also suitable for the classic GROUP LASSO\nmethod.

Based on the elucidation of solution\nconservation between initial sets and obtained non-dominated sets, we define a\nrange of initialisation mechanisms using solutions generated via solvers,\ngreedily and randomly. These are then deployed to seed the population after a\nchange and the performance in terms of hypervolume and spread is presented for\ncomparison.

The\nproposed algorithm does not rely on a good initialization and can handle more\nthan two maps at a time. In multi-robot SLAM applications, maps made by\ndifferent agents have nonidentical spatial frames of reference which makes\ninitialization very difficult in the presence of outliers. This paper presents\na probabilistic approach for detecting incorrect orientation measurements prior\nto pose graph optimization by checking the geometric consistency of rotation\nmeasurements. Expectation-Maximization is used to fine-tune the model\nparameters. As ancillary contributions, a new approximate discrete inference\nprocedure is presented which uses evidence on loops in a graph and is based on\noptimization (Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers). This method yields\nsuperior results compared to Belief Propagation and has convergence guarantees.\nSimulation and experimental results are presented that evaluate the performance\nof the outlier detection method and the inference algorithm on synthetic and\nreal-world data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 06:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-10"}

In which\nsituations is it possible to break symmetry and elect a leader using time as\nsymmetry breaker? To answer this question, we consider configurations. A\nconfiguration is the underlying graph with nodes tagged by non-negative\nintegers with the following meaning. A node can either wake up spontaneously in\nthe round shown on its tag, according to some global clock, or can be woken up\nhearing a message sent by one of its already awoken neighbours. The local clock\nof a node starts at its wakeup and nodes do not have access to the global clock\ndetermining their tags. A configuration is feasible if there exists a\ndistributed algorithm that elects a leader for this configuration.\n  Our main result is a complete algorithmic characterization of feasible\nconfigurations: we design a centralized decision algorithm, working in\npolynomial time, whose input is a configuration and which decides if the\nconfiguration is feasible. We also provide a dedicated deterministic\ndistributed leader election algorithm for each feasible configuration that\nelects a leader for this configuration in time $O(n^2\\sigma)$, where $n$ is the\nnumber of nodes and $\\sigma$ is the difference between the largest and smallest\ntag of the configuration.

The first issue is\ncrucial in practice for, e.g., trapped-ion experiments which actually have a\nlower bound on the possible ratio of timestep to lattice spacing. To this end,\nwe show that a timestep equal to or going to zero faster than the spatial\nlattice spacing is necessary for quantum simulations of QFT, but far more\nimportantly a timestep equal to the lattice spacing is actually sufficient. To\ndo this, first for $\\phi^4$ theory, we give a quantum circuit exactly\nequivalent to the real-time path integral from the discrete-time Lagrangian\nformulation of lattice QFT. Next we give another circuit with no lattice QFT\nanalogue, but, by using Feynman rules applied to the circuit, we see that it\nalso reproduces the correct continuum behaviour.

We make some abstractions that over-approximate the way in which\nSolidity/Ethereum behave. Based on this formalisation, we create Solidifier: a\nbounded model checker for Solidity. It translates Solid into Boogie, an\nintermediate verification language, that is later verified using Corral, a\nbounded model checker for Boogie. Unlike much of the work in this area, we do\nnot try to find specific behavioural/code patterns that might lead to\nvulnerabilities. Instead, we provide a tool to find errors/bad states, i.e.\nprogram states that do not conform with the intent of the developer. Such a bad\nstate, be it a vulnerability or not, might be reached through the execution of\nspecific known code patterns or through behaviours that have not been\nanticipated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 10:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-10"}

Based on the breaking of U(1) symmetry associated with\nparticle-number conservation, this perturbation theory must operate under the\nconstraint that the average number of particles is self-consistently adjusted\nat each perturbative order. The corresponding formalism is presently detailed\nwith the goal to characterize the behavior of the associated Taylor series.\nBMBPT is, thus, investigated numerically up to high orders at the price of\nrestricting oneself to a small, i.e. schematic, portion of Fock space. While\nlow-order results only differ by 2 - 3 % from those obtained via a\nconfiguration interaction (CI) diagonalization, the series is shown to\neventually diverge. The application of a novel resummation method coined as\neigenvector continuation further increase the accuracy when built from\nlow-order BMBPT corrections and quickly converges towards the CI result when\napplied at higher orders. Furthermore, the numerically-costly self-consistent\nparticle number adjustment procedure is shown to be safely bypassed via the use\nof a computationally cheap a posteriori correction method. Eventually, the\npresent work validates the fact that low order BMBPT calculations based on an a\nposteriori (average) particle number correction deliver controlled results and\ndemonstrates that they can be optimally complemented by the eigenvector\ncontinuation method to provide results with sub-percent accuracy.

Successful diffusion of innovation\nrequires the individuals to hold both awareness and expert knowledge, so they\ncan evaluate the innovation and use it properly. A computational model\n\"USA/IPK\" was recently proposed to study the role and impact of information\nseeking on the dynamics of word-of-mouth.

Because of its relative small size and mass, there has not been yet a\ngeneral consensus about the existence of extra-tidal structures around it.\nWhile some previous results claim for the absence of such features, others have\nshown that the cluster is under the effects of tidal stripping. From DECaLS g,r\nmagnitudes of stars placed along the cluster Main Sequence in the\ncolour-magnitude diagram --previously corrected by interstellar reddening--, we\nbuilt the cluster stellar density map. The resulting density map shows nearly\nsmooth contours around Pal 13 out to 1.6 times the most recent estimate of its\nJacobi radius, derived by taking into account its variation along its orbital\nmotion. This outcome favours the presence of stars escaping the cluster, a\nphenomenon frequently seen in globular clusters that have crossed the Milky Way\ndisc a comparable large number of times. Particularly, the orbital high\neccentricity and large inclination angle of this accreted globular cluster\ncould have been responsible for the relatively large amount of cluster mass\nlost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 12:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

The large quantity of high-quality asteroseismic data that obtained\nfrom space-based photometric missions and the accuracy of the resulting\nfrequencies motivate a careful consideration of the accuracy of computed\noscillation frequencies of stellar models, when applied as diagnostics of the\nmodel properties.\n  Aims. Based on models of red-giant stars that have been independently\ncalculated using different stellar evolution codes, we investigate the extent\nto which the differences in the model calculation affect the model oscillation\nfrequencies.\n  Methods. For each of the models, which cover four different masses and\ndifferent evolution stages on the red-giant branch, we computed full sets of\nlow-degree oscillation frequencies using a single pulsation code and, from\nthese frequencies, typical asteroseismic diagnostics. In addition, we carried\nout preliminary analyses to relate differences in the oscillation properties to\nthe corresponding model differences.\n  Results. In general, the differences in asteroseismic properties between the\ndifferent models greatly exceed the observational precision of these\nproperties, in particular for the nonradial modes whose mixed acoustic and\ngravity-wave character makes them sensitive to the structure of the deep\nstellar interior.

For\ninstance, the maximal quantum violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt\ninequality certifies that the underlying state contains the two-qubit maximally\nentangled state and the measurements of one party contains a pair of\nanti-commuting qubit observables. As a consequence, the other party\nautomatically verifies the set of states remotely steered, namely the\n\"assemblage\", is in the eigenstates of a pair of anti-commuting observables. It\nis natural to ask if the quantum violation of the Bell inequality is not\nmaximally achieved, or if one does not care about self-testing the state or\nmeasurements, are we capable of estimating how close the underlying assemblage\nis to the reference one? In this work, we provide a systematic\ndevice-independent estimation by proposing a framework called \"robust\nself-testing of steerable quantum assemblages\". In particular, we consider\nassemblages violating several paradigmatic Bell inequalities and obtain the\nrobust self-testing statement for each scenario. Our result is\ndevice-independent (DI), i.e., no assumption is made on the shared state and\nthe measurement devices involved. Our work thus not only paves a way for\nexploring the connection between the boundary of quantum set of correlations\nand steerable assemblages, but also provides a useful tool in the areas of DI\nquantum certification. As two explicit applications, we show 1) that it can be\nused for an alternative proof of the protocol of DI certification of all\nentangled two-qubit states proposed by Bowles et al., and 2) that it can be\nused to verify all non-entanglement-breaking qubit channels with fewer\nassumptions compared with the work of Rosset et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 14:50:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 23:13:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 09:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

We propose the conditional DGP model\nin which the latent GPs are directly supported by the fixed lower fidelity\ndata. Then the moment matching method in [2] is applied to approximate the\nmarginal prior of conditional DGP with a GP. The obtained effective kernels are\nimplicit functions of the lower-fidelity data, manifesting the expressivity\ncontributed by distribution propagation within the hierarchy. The\nhyperparameters are learned via optimizing the approximate marginal likelihood.\nExperiments with synthetic and high dimensional data show comparable\nperformance against other multi-fidelity regression methods, variational\ninference, and multi-output GP.

I.e., for two states with similar representations, their\noptimal policies can be significantly different. In this case, representing the\nentire policy with a function approximator (FA) with shared parameters for all\nstates maybe not desirable, as the generalization ability of parameters sharing\nmakes representing discontinuous, non-smooth policies difficult. A common way\nto solve this problem, known as Mixture-of-Experts, is to represent the policy\nas the weighted sum of multiple components, where different components perform\nwell on different parts of the state space. Following this idea and inspired by\na recent work called advantage-weighted information maximization, we propose to\nlearn for each state weights of these components, so that they entail the\ninformation of the state itself and also the preferred action learned so far\nfor the state. The action preference is characterized via the advantage\nfunction. In this case, the weight of each component would only be large for\ncertain groups of states whose representations are similar and preferred action\nrepresentations are also similar. Therefore each component is easy to be\nrepresented. We call a policy parameterized in this way an Advantage Weighted\nMixture Policy (AWMP) and apply this idea to improve soft-actor-critic (SAC),\none of the most competitive continuous control algorithm. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that SAC with AWMP clearly outperforms SAC in four commonly used\ncontinuous control tasks and achieve stable performance across different random\nseeds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 15:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-10"}

Most of the existing mitigation\ntools adopt a fail-stop strategy to protect programs from intrusions, which\nmeans the victim program will be terminated upon detecting a memory safety\nviolation. Unfortunately, the fail-stop strategy harms the availability of\nsoftware.\n  In this paper, we propose Saturation Memory Access (SMA), a memory spatial\nerror mitigation mechanism that prevents out-of-bounds access without\nterminating a program. SMA is based on a key observation that developers\ngenerally do not rely on out-of-bounds accesses to implement program logic. SMA\nmodifies dynamic memory allocators and adds paddings to objects to form an\nenlarged object boundary. By dynamically correcting all the out-of-bounds\naccesses to operate on the enlarged protecting boundaries, SMA can tolerate\nout-of-bounds accesses. For the sake of compatibility, we chose tagged pointers\nto record the boundary metadata of a memory object in the pointer itself, and\ncorrect the address upon detecting out-of-bounds access.\n  We have implemented the prototype of SMA on LLVM 10.0. Our results show that\nour compiler enables the programs to execute successfully through buffer\noverflow attacks. Experiments on MiBench show that our prototype incurs an\noverhead of 78\\%.

It is an inherently non-linear\nprocedure and typically involves a series of sequential solutions of linear\nsystems with similar, albeit not identical system matrices, derived for\ndifferent data models of the same data set. Sequences of this kind arise for\ninstance in the maximization of the data likelihood with respect to foreground\nparameters or sampling of their posterior distribution. However, they are also\ncommon in many other contexts. In this work we consider solving the component\nseparation problem directly in the measurement (time) domain, which can have a\nnumber of important advantageous over the more standard pixel-based methods, in\nparticular if non-negligible time-domain noise correlations are present as it\nis commonly the case.

In this work,\nwe perform a comparative evaluation of nuclei segmentation algorithms on a\ndatabase of manually segmented 3d light microscopy volumes. We propose a novel\nlearning strategy that boosts segmentation accuracy by means of a simple\nauxiliary task, thereby robustly outperforming each of our baselines.\nFurthermore, we show that one of our baselines, the popular three-label model,\nwhen trained with our proposed auxiliary task, outperforms the recent\nStarDist-3D. As an additional, practical contribution, we benchmark nuclei\nsegmentation against nuclei detection, i.e. the task of merely pinpointing\nindividual nuclei without generating respective pixel-accurate segmentations.\nFor learning nuclei detection, large 3d training datasets of manually annotated\nnuclei center points are available. However, the impact on detection accuracy\ncaused by training on such sparse ground truth as opposed to dense pixel-wise\nground truth has not yet been quantified. To this end, we compare nuclei\ndetection accuracy yielded by training on dense vs. sparse ground truth. Our\nresults suggest that training on sparse ground truth yields competitive nuclei\ndetection rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 15:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-10"}

Due to the FD characteristics, the dynamic\nfluctuation of R's residual energy is difficult to quantify and track. To solve\nthis problem, we apply a novel discrete-state Markov Chain (MC) method in which\nthe practical finite-capacity energy storage is considered. Furthermore, to\nimprove the privacy level of the proposed HOR relaying system, covert\ntransmission performance analysis is developed and investigated, where\nclosed-form expressions of optimal detection threshold and minimum detection\nerror probability are derived.

An interesting counterpoint\nto the prediction of such events is their retrodiction -- given a process in an\noutlier state, how did the events leading up to this endpoint unfold? In\nparticular, was there only a single, massive event, or was the history a\ncomposite of multiple, smaller but still significant events? To investigate\nthis problem we take heavy-tailed stochastic processes (specifically,the\nsymmetric, $\\alpha$-stable L\\'evy processes) as prototypical random walks. A\nnatural and useful characteristic scale arises from the analysis of processes\nconditioned to arrive in a particular final state (L\\'evy bridges). For final\ndisplacements longer than this scale, the scenario of a single, long jump is\nmost likely, even though it corresponds to a rare, extreme event. On the other\nhand, for small final displacements, histories involving extreme events tend to\nbe suppressed. To further illustrate the utility of this analysis, we show how\nit provides an intuitive framework for understanding three problems related to\nboundary crossings of heavy-tailed processes. These examples illustrate how\nintuition fails to carry over from diffusive processes, even very close to the\nGaussian limit. One example yields a computationally and conceptually useful\nrepresentation of L\\'evy bridges that illustrates how conditioning impacts the\nextreme-event content of a random walk.

In\ncontrast with a claim of previous works, only this HIC is a practical\ntransceiver HIC. Using the perturbation approach and adding gaps to both shield\nand inner wire of the cable, we tune the resonance frequency to be suitable for\nultra-high field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our theoretical model\nis verified by simulations. Designing the HIC theoretically, we have fabricated\nan array of three HICs operating at 298 MHz. The operation of the array has\nbeen experimentally studied in presence of different phantoms used in UHF MRI\nand the results compared with those obtained for a conventional array.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 08:22:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

Correlated generation from variable renewable sources\ndepresses market prices, which can cause wind and solar to cannibalise their\nown revenues and prevent them from covering their costs from the market. This\ncannibalisation appears to set limits on the integration of wind and solar, and\nthus to contradict studies that show that high shares are cost effective. Here\nwe show from theory and with simulation examples how market incentives interact\nwith prices, revenue and costs for renewable electricity systems. The decline\nin average revenue seen in some recent literature is due to an implicit policy\nassumption that technologies are forced into the system, whether it be with\nsubsidies or quotas. This decline is mathematically guaranteed regardless of\nwhether the subsidised technology is variable or not. If instead the driving\npolicy is a carbon dioxide cap or tax, wind and solar shares can rise without\ncannibalising their own market revenue, even at penetrations of wind and solar\nabove 80%. The strong dependence of market value on the policy regime means\nthat market value needs to be used with caution as a measure of market\nintegration. Declining market value is not necessarily a sign of integration\nproblems, but rather a result of policy choices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 11:34:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 10:57:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 May 2021 17:29:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

Dialog State Tracking (DST), which is often a core\ncomponent of these systems, tracks the system's understanding of the user's\ngoal throughout the conversation. To enable accurate multi-domain DST, the\nmodel needs to encode dependencies between past utterances and slot semantics\nand understand the dialog context, including long-range cross-domain\nreferences. We introduce a novel architecture for this task to encode the\nconversation history and slot semantics more robustly by using attention\nmechanisms at multiple granularities. In particular, we use cross-attention to\nmodel relationships between the context and slots at different semantic levels\nand self-attention to resolve cross-domain coreferences. In addition, our\nproposed architecture does not rely on knowing the domain ontologies beforehand\nand can also be used in a zero-shot setting for new domains or unseen slot\nvalues.
